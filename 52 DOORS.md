DOORS SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The different doors
of the single aisle family are: - Passenger doors, - Emergency exits, -
Cargo doors, - Avionics compartment doors, - Cockpit door.
PASSENGER DOORS The single aisle family is equipped with two forward and
two aft passenger doors. These are plug-type doors that open upward,
outward and forward parallel to the fuselage. The doors can be operated
from the inside or the outside the aircraft. Normal operation of the
doors is manual, with hydraulic damping. Each door is equipped with an
emergency opening system: - An escape slide stowed in a container
attached to the lower side of the door, - A door damping and emergency
operation cylinder that assists normal door operation and acts as an
actuator for automatic door opening in an emergency, - a slide
ARMING/DISARMING lever. When the slide-arming lever is in the ARMED
position, the slide is connected to the floor. When the door is opened
from inside, the escape slide inflates and deploys automatically.
Opening the door from the outside disarms the escape slide mechanism
automatically. The slide remains then undeployed.

LOCKING MECHANISM DESCRIPTION (3) LOCKING HOOK
GEAR BOX
The locking hook engages on a roller mounted on the doorframes. The door
is locked by a hook.
The shaft of the door central handles is coupled via a gear box so that
the outer handle will not move when the door is lifted by operation of
the inner handle. The gear box is connected by rods to the locking shaft
and lifting lever.
SAFETY PIN A safety pin blocks the door even if a double mechanical
failure in the locking mechanism and the lifting mechanism occurs. The
safety pin prevents any upward door movement.
LOCKING SHAFT The locking shaft is locked in an over centered position.
An arm on the locking shaft forms the visual locking indicator. The
locking shaft is connected to the hook by a rod and bell crank.
SPRING ROD The over centered position is maintained by a clearance even
if structural deformation occurs. A spring rod maintains the locking
shaft in an over centered position.
DISARMING MECHANISM When the outer control handle is operated, the
release mechanism of the emergency escape slide/raft is returned to the
disarmed position. A cam disk and a roller connect the emergency control
handle and the outer control handle.
LIFTING LEVER The door moves upwards until it clears the stop fitting
and then moves outwards. The lifting lever is connected, to the support
arm, which acts as a fixed point, and to the control mechanism mounted
on the movable door, which transmits a lifting movement to the door.
TORSION BAR SPRING
LOWERING SHAFT
A torsion bar spring compensates the weight of the door.
The door cannot be lowered in the open position while beyond the
doorframe. The lowering shaft mechanism locks the control handle to
prevent the door from being lowered when not in contact with the
doorsill.
GIRT BAR
EMERGENCY CONTROL HANDLE
The escape slide/raft is fastened to the girt bar. The emergency control
handle is connected to the girt bar.
The emergency control handle is located far from the inner control
handle. It is connected via rods and levers to the girt bar actuating
mechanism.

DAMPER/EMERGENCY CYLINDER DESCRIPTION (3) DOOR DAMPER FUNCTION The door
damper cylinder function is to damp door movement during opening and
closing, in windy conditions for example. Damping is done by hydraulic
fluid going through a restrictor as the operating rods extend or
retract.
EMERGENCY FUNCTION The damper and emergency operation cylinder forms an
emergency actuator that assists and improves the opening speed of the
door in emergency conditions. When opened in an emergency situation, the
operating percussion lever lets the nitrogen bottle pressure act upon
the piston to push it out. NOTE: The door can be closed after an
emergency opening.

DOORS OPENING FOR MAINTENANCE (2) OPENING FOR MAINTENANCE To open one of
the two emergency exit hatches from the outside, a red panel has to be
pushed in, the door falls into the cabin and activates the escape slide
release mechanism. To open one of the two emergency exit hatches from
the inside, pull down the cover flap from the recess. A slide armed
indicator illuminates to show that the escape slide release mechanism is
in the armed configuration. To disarm the mechanism, turn the
retractable pin a quarter turn anticlockwise. This is confirmed by the
extinguishing of the slide armed indicator. Pull the lever of the hatch
control handle to the down position. Carefully let the top of the hatch
fall inwards so that it comes clear of the structure. Take the lower
handle and pull the hatch from the recess. A red manual handle can be
used to activate the escape slide release mechanism manually. Install a
rigging pin in the provision of the hatch frame. A ditching line
attachment point housed in the door frame, and a dual point on the wing
upper surface enable the ditching line to be connected.
Training Point:There have been several reported incidents of doors being
opening with excessive cabin pressure present. this results in the door
pushing outwards at speed and with force, causing injury. Introduction
of new labels on the door area give additional recommendations to
minimize the possibility of cabin residual pressure during ground air
supply This improves awareness to reduce risk of aircraft damage and/or
injury to persons during operation of the ground air supply. This is
embodied by the following SB A320-11-1097: Install additional warning
label LP/HP ground connection adjacent to access panels (Mod. 157025).

DOORS STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION (3) OUTER SKIN
STOP PROFILES
The outer skin of the hatch has to cover the cutout in the fuselage, the
outer skin area is bigger than the area of the fuselage cutout. Thus the
hatch is a pure plug type door. The pressure load on the hatch is
transferred along the stop profiles via the seal into the fuselage skin.
The material of the outer skin is aluminum alloy. Its thickness has been
reduced locally by chemical etching for weight saving purpose.
When the passenger compartment is pressurized, the pressure loads are
transferred into the fuselage structure via the two extruded stop
profiles which are riveted to the vertical edge members. At the vertical
stop profiles, the retaining channel is integrated in the extruded
parts.
HORIZONTAL BEAMS
The structure includes an aluminum alloy forged frame, which is
identical to a passenger window frame.
The horizontal beams are acting as stiffeners for the outer skin, they
prevent a large deflection of the outer skin. The horizontal beams are
made from aluminum formed sheet metal.
SEAL
WINDOW
The seal is retained by a formed sheet metal retaining channel, which is
riveted to the hatch structure. The hatch seal is a fabric reinforced
silicone rubber lip-type seal.
FRAME SEGMENTS Like the horizontal beams, the frame segments are acting
as stiffeners for the outer skin. They are also made from aluminum
formed sheet metal. It includes aluminum alloy formed sheet vertical
frame segments.
INNER SKIN The inner skin maintains the position of frame segments and
horizontal beams and prevents them from buckling on the inside. The
inner skin consists of several segments. These segments are made from
aluminum formed sheet metal.
EDGE MEMBERS The purpose of the edge members is to stiffen the skin at
its edges and to maintain torsion stiffness of the exit door structure.

LOCKING MECHANISM DESCRIPTION (3) SLIDE RELEASE MECHANISM
LATERAL GUIDE
The guide pin locks the spring-loaded latch pin. When the spring-loaded
latch pin is extended it is in the ARMED position, and when the latch
pin is retracted it is in the DISARMED position. The slide release
mechanism includes the guiding fitting, the spring and the latch pin.
For maintenance purposes, the latch pin can be disarmed by turning it
counter-clockwise.
The lateral guides put the hatch in the center position during the
installation. A lateral guide fitting is attached on each vertical edge
member of the emergency exit hatch.
LOCKING SHAFT UNIT The locking shaft unit includes the two locking hooks
and the locking shaft. A connection rod attaches the hatch handle to the
locking shaft.
CONTROL HANDLE The hatch control handle has two tension springs which
retain the handle in the up position. When the hatch control is
released, the connection causes a movement of the locking shaft unit.
LOCKING HOOKS Inside or outside operation of the control handles locks
or unlocks the hatch. When the emergency exit hatch is correctly locked,
the locked hooks engage in the upper roller fittings.
LOWER ROLLER The lower rollers put the emergency exit hatch in line with
the fuselage during the installation. The lower roller brackets,
attached on the hatch bottom beam, engage in their pivot fitting.

DOORS OPERATION (2) DESCRIPTION/OPERATION For the evacuation of the
passengers, there are four emergency exit doors as well as four regular
passenger/crew doors. Two emergency exit doors are installed on each
side of the cabin, two FWD of the wing leading edge and two aft of the
wing trailing edge. The operation is similar to that of the normal
passenger doors. The FWD left emergency exit door is larger in size than
the others and is known as a 73" door. The three other emergency exit
doors are 60" doors. Door operation from outside or inside and in
emergency is identical for all the emergency doors. The emergency exit
door is installed with a support arm and two guide arms which maintain
the door parallel to the fuselage in operation. The door mechanism is
manually operated, it locks and keeps the door in the safety closed
position. It also unlocks and lifts the door before you can move the
unlocked door to the open position. The primary components of the door
locking mechanism are: - the door handle mechanism, - the locking shaft
mechanism, - the balance mechanism, - the lifting mechanism. The lifting
mechanism will lock, unlock the door and operate the lifting mechanism.
This moves the door up so that the lateral guide rollers come free from
the fuselage guide fittings. A balance mechanism decreases the force
necessary to operate the lifting mechanism. The door moves inwards,
upwards and forward parallel to the fuselage and is locked by a
mechanical lock in the open position. The door lock open mechanism is
installed on the support arm. To close the door, operate the release
button so that the spring-loaded linkage releases the locking hook. The
escape slide-release mechanism operates the automatic inflation system.
There are two modes: - the ARMED mode for the emergency door
operation, - the DISARMED mode for normal door operation.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500
The DISARMED mode allows the door to be manually opened without escape
slide operation. When the door is opened from the inside of the cabin in
the ARMED mode the emergency operation cylinder releases nitrogen to
assist the door into its fully open position. The cylinder is shown in
maintenance position with the safety pin installed. The escape
slide-release mechanism operates the automatic inflation system to
inflate the escape slide installed below the door. When the door is
unlocked from the outside in the ARMED mode the escape slide-release
mechanism is automatically DISARMED. The door damper hydraulically
limits the speed of the door under normal operating conditions. Under
emergency conditions the door damper acts as an actuator to open the
door rapidly. To initiate emergency operation, the release lever is
raised by door upward movement. The percussion mechanism breaks the
diaphragm of the pressure accumulator and causes the nitrogen gas from
the pressure accumulator to extend the actuator piston rod. A pressure
gage and pressure switch are mounted on the pressure accumulator. The
pressure gage has a red, yellow and green indicator area to show the
actual pressure in the gas cylinder. The pressure switch relays a signal
to the CIDS if pressure is low. Two proximity switches monitor the
locked/unlocked condition and the DISARMED/ARMED condition of the door.
One proximity sensor, which is part of the escape slide warning system,
transmits a signal to the ECAM system. It gives a warning in the cockpit
on the lower ECAM display panel when a door is opened in the ARMED mode.
At the same time the white indicator light SLIDE ARMED located near the
door window comes on. The other proximity sensor is part of the door
warning system and also transmits a signal to the ECAM system. It shows
on the lower ECAM display panel, when the door is unlocked. An
additional proximity sensor and target is installed in the fuselage
above the door. This sensor is part of the door warning system and
monitors the OPEN/CLOSE position on the ECAM page. Now is shown the door
ECAM page, door 1 LH side locked and slide armed. All the doors in green
are locked and in amber open. The red warning light CABIN PRESSURE near
the window flashes on ground if the door is in

DISARMED mode and there is a difference between the inside and outside
pressure with the two engines off. Before opening the door, check
warning lights. Now we will show the emergency exit door in more detail.
The structural door components are made of aluminum alloy, they are
riveted together to give the door its rigidity. Integrated in the door
skin is the exterior handle and window. The door has two hoisting points
integrated in the frame segments above the door centerline. The door
seal is an extruded rubber seal profile with equally-spaced
pressurization holes. When the cabin is pressurized, the door seal
inflates and makes the door pressure-tight. Blankets are installed in
the interspace of the primary structure for sound and thermal
protection. They are attached with Velcro tapes on the inner face of the
outer skin. The primary components of the escape slide-release mechanism
are: - the arm/disarm unit, - the release assembly. Here is shown the
operation of the components. The doorstop assemblies include the
adjustable stops and the related stop fittings. The guide assembly
contains the guide rollers and the related guide fittings. Here we see
its operation during door movement.

DOORS STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION (3) OUTER SKIN
WINDOW
The outer skin covers the door cutout area in the fuselage skin. When
the cabin is pressurized, the outer skin carries the whole internal
pressure on this area.
The observation window permits the door warning to be checked from
outside.
LONGERON The horizontal longerons are stiffening elements for the outer
skin and there are vertical frame segments. They also act as load
concentrators: the pressure load on the skin is concentrated on the ends
of the seven horizontal longerons, where the door stops are located.
Longerons and outer skin edge members are riveted together.
DOOR STOPS The loads resulting from the cabin pressure are transmitted
by adjustable stops into the door frame and into the fuselage structure.
The door stops are made from forged titanium.
GUIDE ROLLERS The guide rollers, mounted on the door frame, guide the
door movement precisely from its lifted to its lowered position and vice
versa, preventing any unintended collision. They move within the guide
ramps, which are mounted on the fuselage frame. Guide rollers and guide
fittings also block the door in the closed position. The guide rollers
engage in a ramp to block the door. Two additional guide rollers,
located only on the aft edge of each door, prevent door jamming when
loaded with extreme forces.
SEAL The door seal consists of a rubber extrusion with equally spaced
pressurization holes. The door seal is installed around the edge of the
door and a sealing section is fitted onto the door frame.

NORMAL OPERATION (2) NORMAL DOOR OPENING NOTE: In this module the CARGO
DOORS/NORMAL OPERATION is described on the A320 but the principle is the
same for the A318, A319 and A321. The cargo door is mechanically locked
and operated by the yellow hydraulic system. The door opening operation
procedure is displayed next to the door controls. Let's open the door in
normal conditions. To operate the door handle, push the spring-loaded
flap inwards to release the handle. When the handle rotates the locking
shaft, it moves the cam of the latches, shows the red indicators
retracting, retracts the side pins and opens the vent door. Pull the
door handle outwards and up to the fully UNLOCKED position. Check that
the vent door opens to make sure that there is no residual pressure in
the cargo hold before the door is unlatched. Check that the locking
indicators are red, indicating that the locking hooks are released and
the door is unlocked. Due to internal leakage and the door weight, the
door can open towards its vertical position. Open the access panel below
the fuselage to get access to the door hydraulic control system. Check
the door "OPEN" green indicator by pressing it. The light comes on. Set
the selector on the control panel to "OPEN" and hold it in this
position. The door is opened using two hydraulic actuators pressurized
by the yellow electric pump. When the door is in the "FULLY OPEN" and
locked position, the green indicator,comes on. Release the control
lever. The yellow pump remains operative for a certain amount of time.
the door closes. When the door is in its frame, release the control
selector. The yellow electric pump remains operative for a certain
amount of time. Lock the door before it is able to open again due to
internal leakage and the door weight. Pull the door handle down to its
"LOCKED" position, push it into the recess of the door structure and
check that the locking indicators are green and that the door is flush
with its door frame. Check that the vent door is closed. The
spring-loaded flap locks the control handle. Check that access panels
are closed.
NORMAL DOOR CLOSING To close the cargo door hydraulically (if the cargo
loading option is installed), make sure that the door sill latches are
in the raised position and that all required safety devices are
supplied. Set the control selector to "CLOSE". The yellow hydraulic pump
starts operating - it pressurizes the actuators and unlocks the door.

FWD & AFT CARGO DOOR LOCKING MECH D/O (3) INTERLOCK MECHANISM The
interlock mechanism blocks the latching mechanism in the unlatched
position when the cargo door is not closed. Then the door handle is not
movable and the latching hooks stay in the lifted position. The
interlock mechanism includes the interlock lever with the stop bolt, the
connection rod and the spring unit. The spring unit moves the interlock
lever to the blocked position so that its stop bolt touches the
interlock cam.
SWITCH MECHANISM The switch mechanism is installed in the lower part of
the cargo door. This mechanism includes the target lever with the
related target and the link assy. The target lever is attached on the
support fitting which is riveted on the frame structure. The link assy
transmits the movement of the drive shaft to the target lever. The
target moves to or away from the proximity sensor which is installed
below the door sill of the fuselage. The proximity sensor monitors the
position of the cargo door. It sends information to the ECAM system when
the cargo door is closed or opened.

COCKPIT DOOR D/O (3) DESCRIPTION DOOR The cockpit door opens into the
cockpit and a magnetic door stop keeps it in its fully open position.
The cockpit door structure is a honeycomb core bonded between
pre-impregnated sheets. On the cockpit door there is an upper hinge,
which is attached with screws to the cockpit structure. The bottom of
the cockpit door has an attachment fitting which engages with the floor
structure. There is a cut-out section in the door structure for the door
escape hatch. If an emergency occurs, the cockpit crew can get out of
the cockpit through this door escape hatch. The door escape hatch
structure is the same as the door. There are two pip-pin fittings
installed on the inner side of the hatch. The two pip-pins engage with
the related bracket of the door structure to keep the hatch in position.
The manually operated three-latch mechanism keeps the cockpit door in
the closed position. It is installed on the inner side of the cockpit
door. It has a spring-loaded D-ring assembly which extends or retracts
the three-latch tenons. The tenons engage with the catch of the
electrical release strikes installed opposite in the lavatory wall. The
cockpit door has a door handle and a spyglass.

COCKPIT DOOR D/O (3) DESCRIPTION (continued) CDLS For cockpit security,
the cockpit door has an electro-mechanically operated release system:
the CDLS. A keypad is installed adjacent to the Forward Attendant Panel
(FAP). On the front face, there are two LEDs (red and green) and twelve
P/BSWs with the legends 0 to 9, "\*" and "\#". A buzzer is installed in
the cockpit ceiling panel. A signal from the control unit operates the
buzzer for a minimum of 2 seconds. A toggle switch is installed on the
cockpit door panel on the center pedestal. It is a three-position
switch: UNLOCKed, NORMal and LOCKed. It is spring-loaded and returns
automatically to the NORM position. This is the neutral position in
which the closed cockpit door is automatically locked. An indication
light is installed on the cockpit door panel. The indication is an OPEN
legend and a FAULT legend. The OPEN legend comes on amber when the
cockpit door is open. The FAULT legend also comes on amber when there is
a malfunction in the CDLS. Three electrical release strikes are
installed on the lavatory sidewall opposite the door latch mechanism.
Each of the electrical release strikes has a micro switch activated by
the latch when the solenoid is operated. Then the plunger extends and
thus the catch cannot move, or the plunger retracts and thus the catch
is free. The center electrical release strike has an additional micro
switch that monitors the condition of the center latch mechanism. When
its tenon does not engage with the catch, the OPEN indication light
comes on. NOTE: If there is a total failure of the CDLS, the door can be
closed manually from the cockpit side with a deadbolt to make sure that
the A/C operates in MMEL conditions. The control unit is installed on
the overhead panel. It has the legends CocKPiT DOOR CONTrol, STRIKE TOP,
MIDdle and BOTtom and CHANnel 1 and CHAN 2. This unit manages the fault
indications,
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500
CATTS Ltd
time delays and door access control of the CDLS. To make sure that the
CDLS operates in Minimum Equipment List (MEL) conditions, an optional
second control unit can be installed on the overhead panel, as a back-up
system. They have two internal pressure sensors that operate if a rapid
decompression occurs in the flight compartment, which de-energizes the
solenoids. The microprocessor receives signals from the toggle switch
and the keypad. It sends a signal to operate the buzzer, the indication
light, the green or red LED of the keypad and the solenoids of the
electrical release strikes. If a fault occurs in the pressure sensors,
the related CHAN 1 or CHAN 2 LED comes on and the amber FAULT light
comes ON, on the cockpit door panel. If a fault occurs in the electrical
release strikes, the related strike LED comes ON, the amber FAULT light
comes ON, on the cockpit door panel, and the back-up control unit starts
to operate in replacement. NOTE: If a rapid decompression occurs, the
door is blown open by the flow of air through the A/C. If the first
locking attempt is not satisfactory, the power is removed only from the
related strike. After 2 seconds, the strike is activated again. If the
second attempt is also not satisfactory, the strike is deactivated and
the related fault LED comes ON, on the CDLCU. To reset a disabled
strike, the toggle switch on the cockpit door panel must be set to the
UNLOCK position and back to the NORM position. There is an additional
counter that stops the strike for the entire Aircraft power cycle after
ten unsatisfactory locking attempts. The counter is reset after a power
cycle of the CDLS or after one satisfactory locking attempt. This makes
sure that this counter has no effect on the daily operation and on the
dispatchability of the aircraft. Pull the CDLS circuit breaker 1MQ in
the cockpit to reset the system and the counter. The CKPT DOOR BacK UP
panel is a back-up system which is activated through the LocKinG SYStem
override switch, if one of these conditions occurs:

COCKPIT DOOR D/O (3) DOOR OPENING CABIN TO COCKPIT Push the "\#" key or
enter a number plus the "\#" key on the keypad. The buzzer then sounds,
which tells the flight crew that access to the cockpit is requested. If
the flight crew sets the toggle switch to the UNLOCK position: - the
control unit de-energizes the solenoid of the release strikes. This
causes the plungers to retract so that they do not block the catches, -
the control unit sends a signal to the keypad so that the green LED
comes on. This shows that the cockpit door is unlocked and that access
is available, - the buzzer stops. Push the cockpit door in the flight
direction until the magnetic stop keeps it in its fully open position.
The amber OPEN indication light then comes ON on the cockpit door panel.
This shows that the cockpit door is open. If the flight crew sets the
toggle switch to the LOCK position: - the control unit does not
de-energize the solenoids of the release strikes. The plungers therefore
remain extended and block the catches, - the control unit sends a signal
to the keypad so that the red LED comes on. This shows that the cockpit
door is locked and that access to the cockpit is not available, - the
buzzer stops. In this case, operation of the keypad and the buzzer is
prevented during a specific time of between 5 and 15 min. The flight
crew can cancel this function if they set the toggle switch from the
LOCK position to the UNLOCK position.
CABIN TO COCKPIT (EMERGENCY) Enter the selected four-digit code plus the
"\#" key on the keypad. This causes the buzzer to come on continuously
and the green LED to flash.

If the flight crew does not operate the toggle switch within a specific
time of between 15 seconds and 2 minutes: - the control unit
de-energizes the solenoids of the release strikes. This causes the
plungers to retract so they do not block the catches for 5 seconds, -
the control unit sends a signal to the keypad. This causes the green LED
to come on for 5 seconds. The green LED shows that the cockpit door is
unlocked and access is possible, - the buzzer stops. Push the cockpit
door in the flight direction until the magnetic stop keeps it in its
fully open position. The amber OPEN indication light then comes ON on
the cockpit door panel. This shows that the cockpit door is open. If the
flight crew sets the toggle switch to the UNLOCK position within a
specific time of between 15 seconds and 2 minutes: - the control unit
de-energizes the solenoids of the release strikes. This causes the
plungers to retract so that they do not block the catches, - the control
unit sends a signal to the keypad so that the green LED comes on. The
green LED shows that the cockpit door is unlocked and that access is
possible, - the buzzer stops. Push the cockpit door in the flight
direction until the magnetic stop keeps it in its fully open position.
The amber OPEN indication light then comes ON on the cockpit door panel.
This shows that the cockpit door is open. If the flight crew sets the
toggle switch to the LOCK position within a specific time of between 15
seconds and 2 min: - the control unit does not de-energize the solenoid
of the release strikes. So the plungers remain extended and block the
catches, - the control unit sends a signal to the keypad so that its red
LED comes on. This shows that the cockpit door is locked and access to
the cockpit is not available, - the buzzer stops.
Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 119 of 167
In this case, operation of the keypad and the buzzer is prevented during
a specific time of between 5 and 15 minutes. The flight crew can cancel
this function if they set the toggle switch from the LOCK position to
the UNLOCK position.
BACK-UP SYSTEM (OPTIONAL) The cockpit door locking back-up system is an
optional system activated under Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL)
conditions when the normal CDLS has failed. It ensures that the cockpit
door release system can operate. The fault indication of one system is
automatically inhibited when the other system is selected. If the
optional back-up control unit is installed, an additional toggle switch
lets you do the changeover to the back-up unit. This switch also lets
you completely disconnect the system during maintenance.

DOORS INDICATION & WARNING D/O (3) CIDS WARNINGS Failure indicating
depends on the importance of the failures. There is a Cabin
Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) CAUTion light in the upper
left-hand corner of each Forward Attendant Panel (FAP) page display. It
is normally off. The CAUTion light flashes amber when the active
DIRector detects a fault that needs cabin crew action. The action needed
is displayed in the heading row (e.g. SELECT DOORS PAGE). When you
select the page, the CAUTion light stops flashing and remains on
steadily. If the fault is cleared, the CAUTion light goes off. For some
faults the required page is automatically displayed on the FAP. When the
page is automatically displayed there can also be a BLUE CARD message.
This is a blue rectangle with a fault message written in amber. Major
CIDS faults are also indicated to the flight crew with a Flight Warning
System (FWS) level 2 or level 1 alert. All CIDS faults generate
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) / MCDU class 1, 2, 3 messages.
FAP DOOR PAGE This page displays the doors/slides status on the A/C: - a
red symbol indicates a door unlocked/open, - a green symbol indicates a
door locked and its escape slide armed, - an amber symbol indicates a
door locked but its escape slide disarmed. The indications SLIDE
DISARMED are also shown in amber near the associated symbol.
