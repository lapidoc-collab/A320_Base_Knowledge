HYDRAULIC POWER SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW On the
green system the normal source of pressure is the Engine Driven Pump
(EDP) and as auxiliary source the Power Transfer Unit (PTU). On the blue
system the normal source of pressure is the electrical pump (E-Pump) and
as auxiliary source the Ram Air Turbine (RAT). NOTE: The blue electric
pump can be used as an auxiliary power source for maintenance purposes
on ground. On the yellow system the normal source of pressure is the EDP
and as auxiliary sources the PTU and the electric pump (E- Pump).
An interlock mechanism will only permit RAT stowage if the blades are
properly aligned. It also prevents rotation when stowed. The interlock
will release at approximately 5 degrees from the full extension
position. Extension is by spring force. Retraction (stowage) is by blue
hydraulic pressure. Up lock release is by solenoid operation. Down lock
release is by hydraulic pressure.
NOTE: The yellow system also has a hand pump dedicated to cargo door
operation.
PTU The PTU is an auxiliary pressure supply for either the green or
yellow systems without transfer of fluid between the two systems. It
operates automatically if there is a delta pressure of 500psi between
the green / yellow or yellow / green hydraulic systems. The side
operating as a pump will take fluid from its associated reservoir and
provide an output through the PTU manifold to the HP manifold. The motor
side is supplied from the HP manifold through the PTU manifold, and is
connected to the return system. The PTU is de-activated by closing the
solenoid valves on the PTU manifolds. Each section of the PTU has a case
drain connection to the return system.
RAT The RAT is an auxiliary pressure supply for the blue system, and for
the emergency electrical power Constant Speed Motor/Generator (CSM / G).
It can be deployed automatically or manually depending on the failure
conditions. The RAT is locked when extended.

GREEN HYDRAULIC SYSTEM D/O (3) EDP
B2 SCOPE CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY
AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE.
GENERAL Most of the system components are installed in the MLG
compartment.
RESERVOIR The reservoir has a direct reading gauge, a quantity indicator
and a low level switch for ECAM indicating and warning. There are three
levels: - Normal fill level: 14 l. (3.7 US gal), - Maximum gaugeable
level: 18 l. (4.76 US gal), - Low level warning: 3.0 ± 0.4 l. (0.79 ±
0.1 US gal).
The EDP is attached to the accessory gearbox. A solenoid valve
controlled by the ENG 1 PUMP P/B selects the pressurized or
depressurized mode. The EDP cooling and lubricating flow goes through
the case drain filter installed in the return circuit. Pump outlet
pressure is 3000 psi (206 bar) at zero flow. The EDP includes a blocking
valve, which isolates the pump from the hydraulic system when the pump
operates in depressurized mode. Case drain filter clogging indication: P
= 87 ± 8.7 psi (6 ± 0.6 bar).
ACOUSTIC FILTER The acoustic filter is installed in the outlet from the
green EDP. It removes the pulses of pressure of the HP flow from the
pump. The acoustic filter is an empty metal sphere, with inlet and
outlet connections on opposite sides.
PRESSURE SWITCH RESERVOIR PRESSURIZATION The reservoir is normally
pressurized with air to prevent cavitation of the pumps. The reservoir
is pressurized to 50 psi (3.45 bar) and is sealed to hold the pressure
when there is no air supply. The threshold of the LP switch is 22 psi
(1.52 bar). The threshold of the pressure relief valve is 77 psi (5.3
bar).
FIRE VALVE The green system fire valve installed in the LH wing, inboard
of the pylon, is controlled by ENG 1 FIRE P/B. When the valve closes, it
stops the supply of fluid to the Engine Driven Pump (EDP).
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
The EDP pressure switch monitors the EDP outlet pressure for ECAM
indications. The threshold of the pressure switch is 1740 psi (120 bar).
NOTE: A check valve downstream of the pump stops the fluid flow to the
pump if the system is pressurized by the PTU.
GROUND COUPLINGS The ground service panel has two connectors used to
pressurize the green hydraulic system from a ground cart. A selector
valve, two connectors and a hand pump are used for hydraulic reservoir
refilling.

GREEN HYDRAULIC SYSTEM D/O (3) SAMPLING VALVE
HP MANIFOLD The High Pressure (HP) manifold supplies the PTU manifold
and the leak measurement manifold.
PRESSURE SWITCHES The signals from both pressure switches at the HP
manifold are sent to the Flight Control Computers (FCCs), to the
Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU), the ECAM will receive information
from one of the two switches for LP indication, and to the Flight
Augmentation Computer (FAC). The threshold of the pressure switches is
1450 psi (99.5 bar).
A sampling valve is provided on the HP manifold. NOTE: CAUTION: when
sampling, let the fluid run for a moment into a container, then put 0.2L
(0.05USG) of fluid into an appropriate bottle for analysis.
PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE The system relief valve connects the HP circuit to
the return circuit in case of overpressure. The relief valve opens at
3436 psi (237 bar) and closes at 3190 psi (220 bar).
PRESSURE TRANSDUCER The pressure transducer provides data for pressure
indication on the ECAM and sends information to Elevator Aileron
Computers (ELACs) 1 and 2.
LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVE The leak measurement valve isolates the primary
flight controls when the guarded LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVES P/B on the
maintenance panel is set to OFF.
HP FILTER The HP filter has a clogging indicator. The clogging indicator
operates when the differential pressure is higher than 87 ± 8.7 psi (6 ±
0.6 bar).
ACCUMULATOR The accumulator acts as a damper for small changes. It also
makes a supply of fluid available in case of any demand. The accumulator
is precharged with nitrogen to 1885 psi (130 bar) at 20°C. It holds 1.1l
(0.29 US gal) of total volume of fluid when it is full.

GREEN HYDRAULIC SYSTEM D/O (3) LEAK MEASUREMENT MANIFOLD (OPTIONAL) The
optional leak measurement manifold supplies the flight controls of the
RH wing, LH wing and tail section via three outputs. After closing the
related leak measurement valve, operating manually a spool valve lets
the related section be supplied for leak measurement testing.
PTU MANIFOLD The PTU manifold is composed of three different valves: -
The normal braking selector valve which cuts the hydraulic supply to the
normal brakes, - The solenoid valve installed in the PTU supply line
which stops the PTU operation, - The priority valve which makes sure
that all available hydraulic pressure is sent to the primary flight
controls if pressure in the system is reduced.
RETURN MANIFOLD The return manifold comprises: - One return filter with
a clogging indicator and a by-pass device, - One temperature sensor
which has one temperature switch and two temperature transducers. The
red pin of clogging indicator comes out when the differential pressure
across the filter is more than 29 ± 4.4 psi (2 ± 0.3 bar). The by-pass
operates when the differential pressure across the filter is more than
58 ± 6.0 psi (4.0 ± 0.4 bar). Then the device lets the fluid go from
inlet to outlet without filtration. The temperature switch and
temperature transducers send data for ECAM warnings and indication on
overhead P/Bs.

INHIBITED The PTU operation is inhibited: - During cargo door
operation, - If the PTU P/B is switched OFF, - When the A/C is on
ground, with one engine running and if the parking brake is set on or
the nose wheel steering is disconnected for towing (example: First
engine start up during push back). As an option, a PTU inhibition logic
prevents the PTU from running in overspeed condition (Hyd reservoir low
level on one sys) and later on leads to the loss of the second sys (Hyd
reservoir overheat on the other sys). In flight, if the PTU is not able
to pressurize a hydraulic failed system (G SYS LO PR or Y SYS LO PR)
within 6 seconds, either due to external leakage or PTU failure, the PTU
is automatically inhibited. This PTU inhibition logic is activated if
both engines are running and remains activated as long as one engine is
running. The 20s relay has been installed for the deactivation of the
PTU inhibition logic. Once the PTU has been automatically inhibited, the
logic is "de-latched" and PTU no longer inhibited 20 seconds after one
of the following are met: - A/C on ground OR, - Both engines stopped, -
The affected hydraulic system does not longer detect a low-pressure
condition.

DETECTOR The system has a current transformer and a phase unbalance
detector which protect the electric circuit from the electric pump. When
there is a fault, the detector gets a signal from the current
transformer. It uses this signal to stop the supply of power to relay
and thus stop the motor. When the unit has operated, it stays in that

PTU INHIBITED The PTU operation is inhibited : - during cargo door
operation, - if the PTU P/B is switched OFF, - when the A/C is on
ground, with one engine running and if the parking brake is set on or
the nose wheel steering is disconnected for towing (example: First
engine start up during push back) . As an option, a PTU inhibition logic
prevents the PTU from running in overspeed condition (Hyd reservoir low
level on one sys) and later on leads to the loss of the second sys (Hyd
reservoir overheat on the other sys). In flight, if the PTU is not able
to pressurize a hydraulic failed system (G SYS LO PR or Y SYS LO PR)
within 6 seconds, either due to external leakage or PTU failure, the PTU
is automatically inhibited. This PTU inhibition logic is activated if
both engines are running and remains activated as long as one engine is
running. The 20s relay has been installed for the deactivation of the
PTU inhibition logic. Once the PTU has been automatically inhibited, the
logic is "de-latched" and PTU no longer inhibited 20 seconds after one
of the following are met: - A/C on ground OR, - Both engines stopped, -
The affected hydraulic system does not longer detect a low-pressure
condition.

YELLOW HYDRAULIC SYSTEM D/O (3) HP MANIFOLD
NOTE: CAUTION: when sampling, let the fluid run for a moment into a
container, then put 0.2L (0.05USG) of fluid into an appropriate bottle
for analysis.
The HP manifold supplies the PTU manifold and the leak measurement
manifold.
PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE
PRESSURE SWITCHES The signals from both HP manifold pressure switches
are sent to the ECAM system, to the Flight Control Computers (FCCs) , to
the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) 2, the Brake and Steering Control
Unit (BSCU) as well as the Alternate Brake Control Unit (ABCU). The
threshold of the pressure switches is 1450 psi (99.5 bar).
The system relief valve connects the HP circuit to the return circuit in
case of overpressure. The relief valve opens at 3436 psi (237 bar) and
closes at 3190 psi (220 bar).
ACCUMULATOR The accumulator acts as a damper for small changes. It also
acts as a supply of fluid available in case of request. The accumulator
is pre-charged with nitrogen to 1885 psi (130 bar) at 20°C. It holds 1l
(0.26 US gal) of total volume of fluid when it is full.
PRESSURE TRANSDUCER The pressure transducer gives data for pressure
indication on the ECAM and sends information to ELevator Aileron
Computers (ELACs) 1 and 2.
LEAK MEASUREMENT MANIFOLD (OPTIONAL)
LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVE The leak measurement valve isolates the primary
flight controls when the guarded LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVES P/B on the
maintenance panel is set to OFF (white OFF light is illuminated). The
solenoid valve is automatically closed if the yellow electric pump is
energized by using cargo door selectors. This is to prevent any movement
of the flight controls.
The optional leak measurement manifold supplies the flight controls of
the RH wing, LH wing and tail section via three outputs. Operating
manually, a spool valve lets the associated section of the flight
controls be supplied for leak measurement testing.
HP FILTER
The PTU manifold is composed of one disconnection and two different
valves.
The High Pressure (HP) filter has a clogging indicator. The clogging
indicator operates when the differential pressure is higher than 87 ±
8.7 psi (6 ± 0.6 bar).
PTU MANIFOLD
QUICK DISCONNECT
SAMPLING VALVE
The quick disconnect is used for maintenance operations to prevent PTU
operation.
A sampling valve is installed on the HP manifold.
SOLENOID VALVE The solenoid valve installed in the PTU supply line,
stops the PTU operation.

PRIORITY VALVE The priority valve makes sure that all available
hydraulic pressure is sent to the primary flight controls if pressure in
the system is reduced.
RETURN MANIFOLD The return manifold comprises: - one return filter with
a clogging indicator and a by-pass device, - one temperature sensor
which has one temperature switch and two temperature transducers. The
red pin of the clogging indicator pops out when the differential
pressure across the filter is more than 29 ± 4.4 psi (2 ± 0.3 bar). The
by-pass operates when the differential pressure across the filter is
more than 58 ± 6.0 psi (4.0 ± 0.4 bar). Then the device allows fluid to
go from inlet to outlet without filtration. The temperature switch and
temperature transducers send data for ECAM warnings and indication on
overhead P/Bs.

HYDRAULIC RESERVOIR PRESSURIZING SYS D/O (3) GENERAL
GROUND CONNECTOR
An air pressure system is provided to pressurize each hydraulic
reservoir in order to ensure adequate fluid supply to the pumps. Each
reservoir is pressurized by air at 50 psi (3.5 bar). The system also
remains airtight in the event of pressurization system failure or after
engine shutdown.
Pressurized air from a ground supply cart goes directly to the reservoir
pressurization unit through a ground connector.
SOURCES
A filter fitted with a clogging indicator is installed in the reservoir
pressurization unit to filter the air from the different supply sources.
The pressure sources are engine 1, via a restrictor or both engines and
the APU, via the pneumatic manifold. The pressure sources are: - the
engine 1 High Pressure (HP) compressor for usual operation, - the
pneumatic system in case of loss of engine 1, - the ground supply.
RESTRICTOR A restrictor limits the airflow and reduces the temperature
of the HP air to a satisfactory level. The restrictor also prevents too
much bleed air leakage in case of a leak downstream of the restrictor.
RESERVOIR PRESSURIZATION UNIT The reservoir pressurization unit controls
the pressure of the air supplied to the reservoirs.
PRESSURE REDUCING VALVE A pressure reducing valve is fitted to the
reservoir pressurization unit. In normal operation, the delivery
pressure of engine 1 has priority over the pressure supply from the
pneumatic manifold. The pressure reducing valve outlet pressure is 50
psi (3.5bar). Two check valves prevent any reverse flow.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
FILTER
WATER SEPARATOR A water separator is installed on the reservoir
pressurization unit. It makes sure that the air delivered to the
reservoirs is clear of any fluid. There are two drain valves that
prevent freezing of the water in the reservoir pressurization unit. One
is an automatic drain valve that is opened after each engine or APU
shutdown; the other one is a manual self-sealing drain valve.
RESERVOIR CHECK VALVE Downstream of the reservoir pressurization unit,
the air supply is divided into three flows to supply the reservoirs
through their related check valve. The green and yellow check valves are
installed between the floor beams above the hydraulic bay and the blue
one is installed in the aft cargo compartment.
PRESSURE GAGE An air pressure gage is installed on each hydraulic
reservoir to indicate the actual pressure. The pressure switch generates
LOW AIR PRESS warning if the pressure is less than 22 psi (1.52 bar).

PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE A pressure relief valve, installed on each
reservoir, relieves pressure to the atmosphere in the event of a system
overpressure. The threshold of the pressure relief valve is 77 psi (5.3

MANUAL DEPRESSURIZATION VALVE A manual depressurization valve is fitted
on each ground service panel to depressurize each reservoir. WARNING:
WHEN USING THE MANUAL DEPRESSURIZATION VALVE, PUT ON EYE PROTECTION AND
KEEP AWAY FROM THE OUTLET OF THE VALVE. THE AIR CAN BE HOT AND CONTAIN
PARTICLES OF DUST AND/OR HYDRAULIC FLUID.

BLEEDING If you have filled the reservoir after: - maintenance, - or
removal/installation of large hydraulic components, - or hydraulic fluid
low level (loss of the hydraulic system), - or high loss of hydraulic
fluid, Do the related bleeding procedure to make sure that the quantity
of hydraulic fluid in the system is correct. For instance, after
maintenance of the hydraulic system upstream of the EDP. Loosen the nut
of the case drain hose so that the air (or hydraulic fluid mixed with
air bubbles) comes out of the connection. Wait until the fluid flows
freely and tighten the nut again. Check for air in the system: - make
sure that the air pressure in the reservoir of the associated hydraulic
system is not less than 50 psi (if necessary, pressurize the
reservoir), - read the gauge of the associated reservoir and make a note
of the fluid level, - depressurize the reservoir of the associated
hydraulic system, - after 5 minutes, read the gauge again and make a
note of the level, - compare both levels, - if the difference between
both levels is more than 2 liters, do the bleeding procedure again until
the result is satisfactory.

EXTERNAL LEAK TEST OF COMPONENTS A leak is the quantity of fluid that
comes out of a component and that is sufficient to become a drop or
drops, or will possibly become a drop. (approximately 20 drops =1 cc,
and 75600 drops =1 gallon) A leakage is a quantity of fluid on the
surface of a component that is not sufficient to become a drop. A stain
is an area on the surface of a component that has a different color. It
is usually caused when fluid leakage becomes dry on the component
surface after a high temperature operation. For a correct analysis of
component leak rates, you must obey the subsequent steps: - the seal
obtained at hydraulic tube connections is obtained on metal-to-metal
surfaces. If a leak cannot be stopped by tightening the nut to the
specified torque, the joint is probably defective and should be
repaired. - when possible, activate components for some cycles before
carrying out the external leakage check. - dynamic seals are easy to
examine for leakage while in the static condition because pistons, slide
valves and swivel joints move only during a short time interval. Many
components cannot be obviously monitored during operation. - by
following the AMM procedure operate the related component, - after
operation, inspect the component. If there is a sign of any external
leakage, compare the quantity of leakage with the values given in the
AMM table for specified limits.

inhibition is achieved by closing the solenoid valves (they are fail
safe open) at the PTU manifolds, and for maintenance actions by also
disconnecting the coupling on the yellow (right) side of the unit. The
PTU operation is inhibited at first engine start and during cargo door
operation. NOTE: At the second engine start, the inhibition is removed
when the second engine master switch is set to ON then the PTU will
operate momentarily for self test purpose.
RAT A RAT retraction module controls the RAT stowage procedure. This
module is installed on the blue servicing panel. NOTE: To prevent a
possible extension during maintenance work, a RAT safety tool must be
installed.
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS To prevent an unwanted operation of the PTU, the
isolation coupling must be disconnected. Keep the RAT extension area
clear of ground equipment and personnel. Install the RAT safety device
before working in the RAT area.

procedure as for the RAT Extension Test. Extend the RAT again by
pressing the RAT Man ON pushbutton on the Emergency Electrical panel.
Check again the indication on the hydraulic page to show the RAT symbol
in green in association with a single chime "RAT Fault" message on ECAM.
Open and safety the relevant CB depending on the task. Examine the RAT
for damages and check the oil level of the gearbox and make sure there
are no leaks. Remove the cover plate on the rear to prepare the
installation of the hydraulic drive motor. Align the spine-shaft and
tighten the attachment bolts. Connect the pressure and suction hose of
the hydraulic ground cart to the blue ground service panel. Make sure
you rotate the nut to the very end of the thread to make sure the
self-sealing coupling is open. Open the stow-panel access to connect the
electrical cable of the ground test box to the connector on the
stow-panel. Install the safety device inside the RAT bay that will hold
the test cage in position during the test. Place the test cage in
position and align the hydraulic lines and the cage to be in the correct
position for the forward safety strut to engage on the cage fitting.
Press the Blue Leak Measurement pushbutton to isolate the primary
flights controls from the hydraulic supply. Start the Blue Electric

HYDRAULIC LEAKAGE (3) Preventing Hydraulic Leaks These simple plumbing
problems can also be real hard to fix if you don't know the basic
hydraulic plumbing rules. If you don't work carefully and follow these
rules, your work may be the cause of the next hydraulic leak that delays
or cancels a flight. Let's look at these basic hydraulic plumbing rules:
contamination that gets into a system or collects on sealing surfaces
can cause leaks internal and external. Hydraulic fluid itself is a
contaminant. It can eat paint and decals. When hydraulic fluid is
allowed to penetrate a composite structure, it will attack the core
material and reduce it to mush. Once a composite assembly has been
attacked, its structural integrity will be lost. To avoid damage caused
by twisting, tearing, and chipping, always lubricate O-rings, packing
seals, back-up rings, and fitting threads with hydraulic fluid before
assembly. When assembling hydraulic system fittings, be sure that seals
and back-up rings are properly positioned before torquing the
connection. When installing an elbow fitting into a component, be sure
that all the threads are completely screwed into the boss. This is to
make sure that the O-ring packing rides in the undercut, and not on the
threads. To prevent an elbow fitting from turning while its lock-nut is
being torqued, hold it with a second wrench. To make a stress-free
installation, be sure that all elbow-to-pipe connections are correctly
aligned before torquing the B-nuts. Do not use pointed, sharp-edged, or
steel tools to remove or install O-ring packing, back-up rings, and
seals. Damage may occur. Never reinstall used O-ring packing or seals.
Once they have been compressed, they will never regain their original
shape again. Before torquing a B-nut, be sure that the tube fits
squarely into the fitting. Never force or bend a tube to make it fit.
Metal tubes don't stretch. If the piece seems shorter upon
reinstallation or after a component change, something is wrong. Stop!
Think! And investigate the problem before you proceed. Make sure that
tubes are not forced into clamps or line blocks. A stressed installation
will lead to a cracked tube at the nearest fitting or B-nut. And, you
can bet it won't be
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
long before it happens. If clamps or line blocks are removed so a tube
or component can be replaced, be sure that they are reinstalled again.
Tubes that are not properly supported will vibrate. Vibration is the
greatest enemy of a hydraulic system. It causes tubes to crack, and
connections at fittings to loosen up and leak. When repairs are
finished, always bleed the system, and leak check your work. We, the
mechanics, have control of torquing. The lack of proper torquing is the
single greatest cause of leaks. Those calibrated elbows are notorious
for being out of calibration. Use a torque wrench.
