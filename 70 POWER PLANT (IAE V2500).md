70 POWER PLANT IAE V2500 PRESENTATION (1) MODULAR CONCEPT (continued) LP
ROTOR The LP rotor has the forward fan, the booster compressor and the
LP shaft, all driven by the LP turbine. The speed of the LP rotor is
indicated on ECAM as N1. The fan assembly has 22 wide-chord blades and
supplies most of the engine thrust. The air produced by the fan is known
as secondary airflow or bypass airflow. The intermediate case is the
main structural support for the front of the engine. To protect the
fuselage in case of a fan failure, it is designed to contain any broken
blades. The 4-stage booster compressor is enclosed in the intermediate
case. The booster supplies air to the engine core. This is primary
airflow. The LP rotor (N1) is made of the fan and the booster compressor
driven by the LP turbine. Open the cowls to gain access to the forward
engine mount. The five-stage LP Turbine extracts energy from the gas
stream delivered from the HP Turbine in order to drive the booster
compressor and the fan. Exhaust gas from the LP turbine goes through a
nozzle to supply propulsive thrust. The LP rotor is supported by roller
and ball bearings, which are lubricated and cooled. The turbine exhaust
case is the main structural support for the rear of the engine. The AFT
mount is attached to the top of the turbine exhaust case.

70 POWER PLANT IAE V2500 PRESENTATION (1) FADEC In order to increase
engine reliability and efficiency, the Full Authority Digital Engine
Control (FADEC) gives the full range of engine control to achieve steady
state and transient engine performances when operated in combination
with aircraft subsystems. Each engine is controlled by an EEC. The EEC
is a dual channel computer. The EEC controls the engine during start and
all operations. The EEC manages engine thrust and protects against
overspeed and overtemperature by controlling the engine sub-systems. The
EEC also monitors all engine subsystems and sensors for failure. When
the engine is running, power for FADEC operation is fulfilled by a
dual-output FADEC alternator driven by the gearbox. The FADEC system has
the dual channel EEC and the following peripherals: - Fuel Metering Unit
(FMU), - Dedicated FADEC alternator, - Compressor control systems, -
Clearance control systems, - Start system (starter shutoff valve,
ignition exciters), - Thrust reverser system, - Heat management
system, - Engine sensors, - Electrical harnesses.

70 POWER PLANT IAE V2500 PRESENTATION (1) EIU/EVMU The EEC interfaces
with various aircraft systems. Essential communication with the EEC
(thrust lever position, air data, etc.) is direct from the applicable
systems and controls. Non-essential communication (autothrust,
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS), etc.) is routed through the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU) of each engine. The EIUs interface with
various aircraft circuits and systems. The data is then transmitted in a
single stream to each EEC channel. Engine vibration monitoring is
accomplished by the Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU). The EVMU
collects vibration data from both engines. The vibration information is
displayed on the ECAM and is also available through the CFDS for
troubleshooting.

70 POWER PLANT IAE V2500 PRESENTATION (1) THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM Reverse
thrust is controlled by the EEC. Reverse is manually selected by the
flight crew by lifting the latching levers on the throttle control
levers. The reverse thrust command is sent to the EEC and the EIU. The
DEPLOY command from the EEC is routed through the EIU as a second level
of protection against inadvertent deployment. According to commands from
the EEC and the EIU, a Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) supplies hydraulic
power to operate the thrust reverser. The thrust reverser assembly has 2
hydraulically actuated translating sleeves. The translating sleeves are
each powered by 2 actuators. As the translating sleeve moves aft during
deployment, it raises blocker doors to redirect the engine fan airflow.
Reverse thrust is only available on the ground.

70 POWER PLANT IAE V2500 PRESENTATION (1) CONTROL AND INDICATING This
section will highlight the control panels and indications for the
engines.
CONTROL PANELS The engines are controlled by throttle control levers, on
the center pedestal. They can only be moved manually. For reverse thrust
operation, two latching levers let the throttle control levers move
rearward into the reverse thrust section. The A320 family aircraft
normally operate in autothrust mode in flight. The autothrust can be
disconnected with the two red buttons known as instinctive disconnect
pushbuttons (2 red buttons on the outside of each throttle control
lever). This lets the engines be controlled in manual thrust mode. The
controls for engine starting and shutdown are on the center pedestal
immediately behind the throttle control levers. The engine MAN START
switches are used to start an engine during a manual start procedure.
They are also used during a dry or wet motoring procedure. The N1 MODE
switches are used to change the engine control mode from Engine Pressure
Ratio (EPR) to N1 control if an EPR failure occurs.

70 POWER PLANT IAE V2500 PRESENTATION (1) SAFETY PRECAUTIONS When you
work on aircraft, make sure that you obey all the Aircraft Maintenance
Manual (AMM) safety procedures. This will prevent injury to persons
and/or damage to aircraft. Here is an overview of main safety
precautions related to the engines. Make sure that all engine danger
areas are as clear as possible to prevent damage to the engine, to the
aircraft or to persons in the area. Be careful: The entry corridor will
be closed when the engine power is above the minimum. Make sure that you
have fire-fighting equipment available. Do not try to stop the fan from
turning by hand. After engine shutdown, let the oil tank pressure bleed
off a minimum of 5 minutes before you remove the tank filler cap. If you
do not, pressurized oil can flow out of the tank and cause dangerous
burns. The engine ignition system is an electrical system with high
energy. You must be careful to prevent electrical shock. Injury or death
can occur. Do not do maintenance on the ignition system while the engine
operates. Make sure that the engine shutdown occurred more than 5
minutes ago before you continue with the maintenance procedure. Make
sure that the thrust reverser is deactivated during maintenance. If not,
the thrust reverser can operate accidentally and cause injury to
personnel and/or damage to the reverser. When opening the engine
cowls: - Respect the wind limitations and the opening/closing
sequence, - Always secure cowls with the hold-open rods, - Make sure
that the slats are retracted and install a warning notice to prevent
slat operation.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) STAGE 2 HPT AIR SEALS
ENGINE SEALS
The stage 2 HPT air seal is located between the stage 1 and 2 turbine
rotor assemblies. The stage 2 air seal also acts as a spacer for proper
axial positioning of both rotors. In order to avoid HPT air seal
cracking, a modification is made to increase cooling air and to reduce
leakage on the 2nd stage vane for IAE V2500-A5 engines.
The most important seals in this engine are: - front bearing compartment
seals, - diffuser case and combustor assembly seal. - stage 1 High
Pressure Turbine (HPT) air seals (inner and outer). - stage 2 HPT air
seal, - LPT seals.
LPT SEALS
FRONT BEARING COMPARTMENT SEALS The sealing of the compartment is done
by the following components: - No.1 bearing front carbon oil seal, -
hydraulic seal assembly for center seal, - bearing compartment rear
brush air seal, - and No.3 bearing rear carbon oil seal.
The outer static stages 3, 4, 5 and 7 rotor seals are separated seal
segments with braze in honeycombs installed in the LPT case. The bearing
No. 5 compartment is sealed from the LPT cavity air by two element
radial carbon seals. The carbon elements are contained in a housing
assembly and sealed against the No. 5 bearing compartment outer wall and
the seal housing walls.
DIFFUSER CASE AND COMBUSTOR SEALS A double seal including a brush and
knife edge seals is bolted onto the front inner diameter of the case.
The seals prevent leakage of HPC discharge air into the diffuser case. A
seal is supplied at the transition from the rear of the combustor outer
liner to the turbine nozzle guide vanes. The front lip of the combustor
inner liner makes a seal with the inner diameter of the combustor hood.
STAGE 1 HPT AIR SEALS In the stage 1 turbine rotor assembly, the blades
fit into axial slots in the hub and are held in place at the front by
the stage 1 air seal (outer). The stage 1 HPT air seal (inner) is
located at the front of the stage 1 turbine hub. The stage 1 HPT inner
and outer air seals control leakage of stage 1 HPT blade cooling air
from the cooling duct.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) OIL COMPARTMENT SEALING Oil Compartment sealing is
achieved by using pressurized air, also called buffer air. This air,
coming from different compressor stages, is directed in front of the
carbon seals to make sure, that only air can enter the bearing
compartment but not oil can leave the bearing compartment. This is
achieved by making sure, that the buffer air pressure is higher than the
pressure in the bearing compartment. The air / oil mixture goes back
into the oil system by the scavenge pump system.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) COMPRESSOR The compressor section includes three
modules: - LPC (fan) module assembly, - LPC/intermediate case module, -
HPC module.
LPC FAN MODULE ASSEMBLY The LPC (fan) module is a rotor assembly, which
includes twenty-two blades and a disk. Rotation of the rotor causes air
to be ingested into the front of the engine and compressed. A large
proportion of the compressed air is delivered through the fan discharge
duct to the exhaust nozzle to supply the majority of engine thrust. The
remainder of the compressed air goes into the booster section for
further compression by the booster.
LPC INTERMEDIATE CASE MODULE The LPC intermediate case module includes a
four stages axial flow booster section, a fan case section and an
internal gearbox and drive section. The fan case section of
LPC/intermediate case module makes the outer annulus of the cold stream
duct.
HPC The HPC is a ten stages axial flow module. It comprises the HPC,
blades, the front casing and variable vanes, the rear casing which
contains the fixed stators and shapes the bleed manifolds.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) COMPRESSOR OPERATION Rotation of the fan rotor
causes air to be ingested into the front of the engine and to be
compressed. Compressed air is then divided into two separate airflows: -
a large portion is delivered to the exhaust nozzle, - the remainder is
compressed in the booster before being compressed again by the HPC. The
fan outlet inner vane assembly, compressor stage 1.5, 2, 2.3 and 2.5
assemblies and compressor stage 2.5 vanes compress the air
progressively. Then the air is delivered at a suitable pressure to the
HPC. Then the HPC accepts air from the LPC and booster system, further
compress it, and direct the air to the diffuser/combustion. LPC bleed
valve and actuating mechanism are incorporated into the bleed air system
The modulated bleed makes sure that the booster has an adequate surge
margin under all operating conditions. Due to the compression ratio that
supports each stage, the airflow tries to expand in counter direction.
If the entire compressor is not capable to compress the airflow. Stall
is a local effect where the airflow is not compressed. Stall effects can
bring the compressor to surge. To prevent the compressor surge the stall
effects are controlled through the methods of airflow control.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) COMBUSTION SECTION The diameter of the diffuser
section is larger at the rear than at the front. This diametral
difference decreases the speed of the air and changes the energy of the
speed into pressure. The combustion section includes primarily the
diffuser case, combustor, fuel injector and igniters. The high
compressor exit guide vanes, the turbine nozzle assembly and the No.4
bearing compartment are also part of the module. The diffuser case has
twenty mounting pads, where the fuel injectors are installed and two
mounting pads where the igniter plugs are installed and six borescope
bosses located around the case. The combustor is an annular type
combustor, which includes an outer liner assembly and an inner liner

section has four primary functions: - straighten the flow of air from
the HPC, - change the flow of air characteristics to get the best speed
and pressure for combustion, - mix fuel with the air and supply ignition
to make the fuel burn, - hold the No.4 bearing in position. In the
combustion section the gases increase their energy with a controlled
combustion process. These gases release their energy to the turbine
nozzles driving the engine rotors. The air is guided and diffused around
the combustor through the diffuser case inner and outer walls. Air,
which surrounds the combustor, is used in the combustion process for
dilution and in exit temperature profile control of the combustion gases
and for the cooling of the combustor walls.

strainer gets blocked, a bypass valve will open. The ten discharge ports
are connected to the ten fuel manifolds, each of which in turn supplies
two nozzles (20 nozzles at all). At an engine shutdown, eight of the ten
internal discharge ports in the valve are connected due to the fact,
that there is no more fuel coming from the FMU and the drain valve in
the FDV is spring-loaded in the closed position. This lets remaining
fuel from the upper eight fuel manifolds to be drained into the engine
through the two lowest fuel manifolds and their related nozzles. The two

HEAT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL Heating and cooling of the fuel,
engine oil and Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil is performed by the
fuel cooled oil cooler, the Air Cooled Oil Cooler (ACOC) and the IDG
fuel cooled oil cooler under the control of the Electronic Engine
Control (EEC). The EEC acts on the heat management system through the
Fuel Diverter and Return to tank Valve (FDRV) and the ACOC modulating
valve.
NOTE: Note: The 4 modes of operation are modes 1, 3, 4 and 5: - modes 1
and 4 are return to tank modes, - modes 3 and 5 are no return to tank
modes.
ACOC MODULATING VALVE Oil heated by the engine passes through the ACOC
and then to the fuel cooled oil cooler. The ACOC modulating valve
regulates a bleed part of fan airflow crossing the ACOC to maintain both
oil and fuel temperatures within acceptable minimum and maximum limits.
FUEL DIVERTER AND RETURN TO TANK VALVE (FDRV) The fuel diverter valve
and the return to tank valve are enclosed in the same housing. The FDRV
maintain fuel, engine oil and IDG oil temperatures within limits by
minimizing ACOC cooling air usage. The two-position diverter valve works
by managing the fuel recirculation inside the engine fuel system. The
return to tank valve will divert a modulated proportion of the LP fuel
back to the aircraft tanks.
CONTROL The EEC controls the heat management system through 4 modes of
operation taking into account 3 parameters of temperature: - engine
fuel, - engine oil, - IDG oil. The temperature of the aircraft fuel
tanks and the engine power setting are parameters used for inhibition of
fuel return to aircraft tanks.

FADEC PRESENTATION (2) - it allows the optimum adaptation of thrust
rating schedules to the A/C needs.
PURPOSE The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system
provides full range engine control throughout all flight and operational
phases. It consists of a dual channel Electronic Engine Control (EEC)
and its peripheral components and sensors.
FADEC FUNCTIONS The FADEC provides the engine system regulation and
scheduling to control the thrust and optimize the engine operation. The
FADEC provides: - power setting with EPR or N1 back-up mode, - P2/T2
heating, - acceleration and deceleration times, - idle speed
governing, - overspeed limits for N1 and N2, - Fuel Flow (FF) control, -
Variable Stator Vane system (VSV) control, - compressor handling bleed
valves control, - booster stage bleed valve system control, - High
Pressure (HP)/Low Pressure (LP) turbine Active Clearance Control
(ACC), - automatic and manual engine starting, - thrust reverser
control, - oil and fuel temperature management through the heat
management system.
POWER SUPPLY The FADEC system is self-powered by a dedicated Permanent
Magnet Alternator (PMA) when N2 is greater than 10%. The EEC is powered
by the aircraft 28 VDC electrical network for starting, as a backup and
for testing with the engine not running. 115 VAC is used for the power
supply of the ignition system and the P2/T2 probe heating. The PMA also
provides the EEC Channel A and Channel B with the N2 rotation speed.
FADEC BENEFITS The application of a FADEC system provides multiple
benefits: - it saves weight and fuel by a full range control of the gas
generator, - it reduces pilot workload and maintenance cost,

FADEC ARCHITECTURE (2) DUAL CHANNEL
BITE CAPABILITY
The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system is fully
redundant and built around two independent control channels. Dual
inputs, dual outputs and automatic switchover from one channel to the
other eliminate any dormant failure. The Electronic Engine Control (EEC)
consists of two channels A and B. Each channel can control the different
components of the engine systems. Channels A and B are permanently
operational. The channel in control manages the system.
The EEC is equipped with a BITE system which provides maintenance
information and test capabilities via the MCDU.
DUAL INPUTS All control inputs to the FADEC system are doubled. Only
some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating are single.
To increase the fault tolerant design, the parameters are exchanged
between the two control channels inside the EEC via the cross channel
data link.
HARDWIRED INPUTS Most of the information exchanged between the A/C and
the EEC is transmitted over digital data buses, some signals over a
single line. In addition, some signals are hard-wired directly from the
A/C to the EEC. The Throttle Lever Angle (TLA) is transformed by
resolvers into a Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA) and transmitted directly
to the EEC. 1° of TLA corresponds to 1.9° of TRA.
DUAL OUTPUTS All the EEC outputs are double, but only the channel in
control supplies the engine control signals to the various receptors
such as torque motors and solenoids. The other channel calculation is
used for crosschecking.
FAULT STRATEGY Using the BITE system, the EEC can detect and isolate
failures. It also allows the EEC to switch engine control from the
faulty channel to the healthy one. Depending on the nature of the
failure, the EEC will behave differently in case of: - single input
signal failure, there is no channel changeover, the channel in control
uses the inputs from the other channel through the cross channel data
link, - dual input signal failure, the system runs on synthesized values
of the healthiest channel, - single output signal failure, there is an
automatic switchover to the standby active channel, - complete output
signal failure, there is no longer any current to drive the torque
motors or solenoids, the related component will go to the "fail-safe"
position.
FAIL-SAFE CONTROL If a channel is faulty and the channel in control is
unable to ensure one engine function, this control is moved to a
fail-safe position. Example: if the channel is faulty and the remaining
channel in control is unable to control the Variable Stator Vane (VSV)
position, the vanes are set to the fail-safe open position.
MAIN INTERFACES To perform all its tasks, the EEC interfaces with A/C
computers, either directly or via the Engine Interface Unit (EIU), which
is an interface

FADEC PRINCIPLE (2) GENERAL The Full Authority Digital Engine Control
(FADEC) system manages the engine thrust and optimizes the performance.
FADEC The FADEC consists of the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) and its
peripheral components and sensors used for control and monitoring. The
EEC is in relation with the other A/C systems through the Engine
Interface Unit (EIU). The primary parameters Engine Pressure Ratio
(EPR), Low Pressure Rotor Speed (N1), High Pressure Rotor Speed (N2),
Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), and Fuel Flow (FF) are sent directly by
the EEC to the ECAM. Secondary parameters: - the oil quantity and oil
pressure are sent to the DMCs by the SDACs. In case of SDACs failure,
the EIU sends data to DMCs by the FWCs, - the oil temperature is sent by
the EIU to DMCs via thhe FWCs, - the fuel used data is directly sent to
DMCs via the EEC, - the vibration parameters are sent by the EIVMU to
DMCs via the SDACs.
EIU Each EIU, located in the avionics bay, is an interface concentrator
between the airframe and the corresponding FADEC located on the engine.
There is one EIU for each engine.
POWER MANAGEMENT The FADEC provides automatic engine thrust control and
thrust parameter limit computation. The thrust is computed according to
the Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) in normal mode or N1 in back-up mode. In
fact, when the Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) mode is no longer operational
the
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
FADEC automatically reverts to the N1 alternate control mode. The FADEC
manages power according to two thrust modes: - manual mode depending on
the Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA), - auto thrust mode depending on the
auto thrust function generated by the Auto Flight System (AFS). The
FADEC also provides two idle mode selections: - approach idle, - minimum
idle. Approach idle is obtained when the slats are extended. Minimum
idle can be modulated up to approach idle depending on air conditioning,
engine anti-ice and wing anti-ice demands.
ENGINE LIMITS The FADEC provides overspeed protection for N1 and N2, in
order to prevent the engine from exceeding limits, and also monitors the
EGT and Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR).
ENGINE SYSTEMS The FADEC provides optimal engine operation by
controlling the: - FF, - compressor airflow and turbine clearance.
IGNITION AND STARTING The FADEC controls the engine start sequence. It
monitors N1, N2, and EGT parameters and can abort or recycle an engine
start. The FADEC controls the ignition and starting in automatic or
manual mode when initiated from the ENGine start or ENGine MANual START
panels.
THRUST REVERSER The FADEC supervises the thrust reverser operation
entirely.

EEC INTERFACES (3) GENERAL In order to provide a full range of engine
control and monitoring, the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) interfaces
with the following sub systems: - air data computers, which transmit air
data for engine control, - Engine Interface Unit (EIU), which
concentrates A/C signals and transmits them to the EEC, - for cockpit
indication and control, and autothrust control, the EEC sends signals to
computers, - engine sensors and controls.
DIGITAL INPUTS
-   engine control parameters,
-   engine condition monitoring parameters,
-   EEC status and fault indication,
-   engine rating parameters,
-   Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system maintenance
    data. The EEC transmits outputs continuously on all buses in normal
    operation, irrespective of whether the given channel is in active
    control or not. The parameter values on the 2 output buses are
    normally identical as long as the cross channel data link is
    functioning. NOTE: Channel switchover does not affect the output
    data of the EEC.
DISCRETE/ANALOG SIGNALS
Inputs of each channel are isolated in order to prevent failure
propagation. Each channel receives inputs for both the Air Data/Inertial
Reference Units (ADIRUs) and the EIU. The EEC performs a fault detection
on its input parameters by determining if they are valid. This check is
made by applying a range of tests to each input. Faults detected by the
EEC are annunciated and recorded for maintenance or crew action, if
required. The ADIRUs send air data parameters to the EEC for engine
control. The EEC performs validation tests and selection logic between
air data signals from the ADIRUs and the engine sensors. ADIRU data is
preferred over engine data. The air data used to validate Altitude (P0),
Total Air Temperature (TAT), TOTal PRESSure, mach for the power
management and engine controls are: - TAT, TOTal PRESSure, P0, mach
number, from the ADIRUs, - P2, T2 and P0 from engine sensors.
The EEC receives the Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA) signals, the
autothrust instinctive disconnect switch signals and engine sensor
signals. They are validated by the EEC. The EEC also sends signals to
the engine controls. The resolvers of the Throttle Control Unit (TCU)
receive an excitation current from the EEC. The EEC checks the range
limits, the rate limits and performs an interface fault detection test.
NOTE: 1 degree TLA corresponds to 1.9 degree TRA.
DIGITAL OUTPUTS Each channel has 2 output ports and each bus has a
separated line driver, i.e. A1, A2, B1, B2, in such a way that
propagation of failures is prevented. The EEC output buses provide:

EIU INTERFACES (3) GENERAL There are 2 Engine Interface Units (EIUs),
one for each engine. The EIU is an interface concentrator between the
A/C and the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The
main functions of the EIU are: - to concentrate data from the cockpit
panels, - to ensure the segregation of the 2 engines, - to provide the
Electronic Engine Control (EEC) with an electrical power supply, - to
give the necessary logic and information from the engine to the aircraft
systems.
EIU COMPOSITION The EIU is composed of 5 main parts: - discrete and
analog inputs, - digital inputs, - digital outputs, - discrete
outputs, - power supply switching.
EIU FUNCTIONS The EIU performs the following: - acquisition of
information, - transmission of messages, - logics for Low Oil Pressure
(LOP) and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) boost, - fault detection logic
carried out by an internal BITE and transmission of the result to the
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).
INPUTS The EIU receives the following: - discrete signals which are of
the ground/open circuit type,
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
-   analog inputs which are of the differential type with a working
    range of 1 to 9 volts,
-   digital inputs on ARINC 429 lines.
OUTPUTS The EIU sends the following: - digital output signals on ARINC
429 buses, - discrete signals which are of the 28V DC/open circuit or
ground/open circuit types.
EEC INTERFACE The EIU receives 2 ARINC 429 output data buses from EEC
channels A and B and it uses data from the channel in control. If some
data is not available from the control channel, data from the other
channel is used. The EIU looks at particular engine data on the EEC
digital data flow to interface this with other aircraft computers and
with cockpit panels for control and monitoring. The EIU sends
information, coming from all aircraft computers, which have to
communicate with the EEC, through an output ARINC 429 data bus. The EIU
does not deal with Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and thrust
lever information as they communicate directly with the EEC. NOTE: Note:
There is no data flow during the EIU internal test or initialization.
ECS INTERFACE The EIU receives two inputs from the Air Conditioning
System Controller (ACSC) 1 and 2 of the Environmental Control System
(ECS). The ECS determines the various air bleed configurations according
to logics of the air conditioning, wing anti-ice and nacelle anti-ice.
This information is transmitted by the EIU to the EEC to compute the
bleed air demand required at the engine customer bleed ports.
CATTS LTD

FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY
-   28V DC for its own power supply and for the FADEC power supply,
-   115V AC for engine ignition system power supply.
ENGINE START CONTROL The EIU receives and generates all starting signals
from the cockpit engine panels. Therefore engine starting is not
possible in case of EIU failure. The control panels provide the EIU with
the following signals: - engine start mode selector position, - master
lever position, - manual start P/B. The EIU provides all starting
signals to the EEC and to the ENGine start panel FAULT light.
NOTE: Note: In case of EIU failure, the power supply for FADEC and
ignition is preserved (fail safe position).
CFDS INTERFACE The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU)
communicates with the BITE memory of the EIU and with the BITE memory of
the EEC via the EIU. The EIU interfaces with the CFDIU to generate the
EIU and the FADEC fault messages on the MCDU. To access the FADEC menu
function, the CFDS interrogates the EEC BITE memory through the EIU.
BMC INTERFACE There is an interface between the EIU and the pneumatic
system Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC) for engines 1 and 2. During
engine start, the EIU generates a ground signal for the BMC when the
start valve moves away from the closed position. On receipt of this
ground signal, the BMC closes the pneumatic system Pressure Regulating
Valve (PRV).
OTHER INTERFACES The EIU also receives other signals from various
aircraft systems for control and monitoring purposes. The EIU also
generates signals for various aircraft systems.
POWER SUPPLY The EIU receives the following:

EIU INTERFACES (3) FMGS The AutoTHRust (A/THR) function is provided by
the Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS). Therefore, the FMGS
sends all command signals for engine power management via the Flight
Control Unit (FCU) and both EIUs. The FMGS assumes the following
functions: - computation of Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) target, -
selection of A/THR modes, - alpha floor protection, - flexible
takeoff, - A/THR engagement.
FEEDBACK The EEC directly sends specific feedback outputs to the FMGS
without going through the EIU. The EIU also receives this data but does
not transmit it to FMGS. The EEC feedback output data to Flight
Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) is as follows: - Thrust Resolver
Angle (TRA), - EPR command, - EPR actual, - EPR target in feedback, -
EPR limit, - EPR max, - EPR reference throttle, - thrust mode, - Fuel
Flow (FF), - bleed configuration in feedback, - engine rating
identification, - flexible temperature in feedback.

EEC ELECTRICAL PWR SPLY CONTROL (3) - 5 min after A/C power-up, - 5 min
after engine shutdown.
GENERAL The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) is electrically supplied
by: - the A/C network when High Pressure Rotor Speed (N2) is below 10%
or when the dedicated alternator has failed, - the dedicated alternator
when N2 is above 10%.
POWERING N2 \< 10% The EEC is supplied by the A/C electrical power
network when N2 is below 10%. Each channel is independently supplied by
the A/C 28V DC through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The aircraft 28V
DC permits: - automatic ground check of the Full Authority Digital
Engine Control (FADEC) system before the engine is running, that is to
say FADEC GrouND PoWeR ON, - engine starting: MASTER lever ON or mode
selector on IGNition or CRANK, - powering the EEC while the engine
reaches 10% of N2.
NOTE: Note: An action on the ENGine FIRE P/B provides EEC power cut-off
from the A/C network.
MANUAL REPOWERING For maintenance purposes and MCDU engine tests, the
ENGine FADEC GrouND PoWeR panel permits FADEC power supply to be
restored on the ground with engines shut down. When the corresponding
ENGine FADEC GrouND PoWeR P/B is pressed ON the EEC recovers its power
supply. NOTE: Note: The FADEC is also repowered as soon as the engine
start selector is in IGNition/START or CRANK position, or the MASTER
lever is selected ON.
NOTE: Note: the EIU takes its power from the same bus bar as the EEC.
POWERING N2 \> 10% As soon as the engine is running above 10% of N2, the
dedicated alternator directly supplies the EEC. The dedicated alternator
supplies each channel with three-phase AC power. Two transformer
rectifiers provide 28V DC power supply to channels A and B. Switching

IGNITION & STARTING SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL
CRANKING
The ignition system provides the electrical spark needed to start or
continue engine combustion. The ignition system is made up of two
independent subsystems energized by a relay box. Each subsystem includes
an ignition exciter, a coaxial shield ignition lead and an igniter plug.
The pneumatic starting system drives the engine High Pressure (HP) rotor
at a speed high enough for a ground or in flight start to be initiated.
The start system is made up of the start valve and the starter.
Engine motoring could be performed for dry cranking or wet cranking
sequences.
CONTROL AND INDICATING The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) controls the
ignition through the relay box and starting through the start valve,
either in automatic or manual mode. The operation of the start valve and
of the ignition system is displayed on the ENGINE ECAM page.
AUTOMATIC START During an automatic start, the EEC opens the start
valve, then the ignition exciter is energized when the HP rotor speed is
nominal. The EEC provides full protection during the start sequence.
When the automatic start is completed, the EEC closes the start valve
and cuts off the ignition. In case of an incident during the automatic
start the EEC aborts the start procedure.
MANUAL START
NOTE: during cranking ignition is inhibited.
CONTINUOUS IGNITION With engine running, continuous ignition can be
selected via the EEC either manually using the rotary selector or
automatically by the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC).
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Safety precautions have to be taken prior to working
in this area. WARNING: THE EEC AND THE RELAY BOX SEND 115 VOLTS TO THE
IGNITION BOXES, WHICH CONVERT IT AND SEND HIGH ENERGY PULSES THROUGH THE
IGNITION LEADS TO THE IGNITERS PLUGS.
MAINTENANCE PRACTICES To increase A/C dispatch, the start valve is
equipped with a manual override. For this manual operation, the mechanic
has to be aware of the engine safety zones.
During a manual start, the start valve opens when the engine MANual
START P/B is pressed in, then the ignition system is energized when the
MASTER control lever is set to the ON position. NOTE: there is no
automatic shutdown function in manual mode.

IGNITION & STARTING SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The Electronic Engine Control
(EEC) controls and monitors the start sequence either in automatic or in
manual mode. The start sequence is aborted below 50% N2 in case of: -
starter valve failure, - ignition failure, - pressure raising Shut-Off
Valve (SOV) failure, - hot start, - hung start, The system consists of a
starter valve, a pneumatic starter, a relay box, two ignition exciters
and igniters A and B. The starter valve is fitted with a manual override
for mechanic operation on ground.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL The
compressor airflow control is fulfilled by a booster stage bleed valve
system, a Variable Stator Vane (VSV) system and additional bleed valves
at the 7th and 10th stages of the High-Pressure Compressor (HPC). All
these systems are controlled by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). The
booster stage bleed valve system is used for the booster compressor
airflow discharge into the fan air stream to make sure that the booster
compressor output matches the HPC requirements at low engine speed and
deceleration. The VSV system directs the airflow into the HPC 4 initial
stages to prevent blade stall and engine surge. Four bleed valves, three
for the 7th stage and one for the 10th stage of the HPC, complete the
compressor airflow control.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) During an engine deceleration the
reverse operation occurs and the bleed valve opens.
COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL (continued) HANDLING BLEED VALVES Handling
bleed valves are installed onto the H.P. compressor to improve engine
starting, and prevent engine surge when the compressor is operating at
off-design conditions. A total of four bleed valves are used, three on
stage 7 and one on stage 10. The handling bleed valves are 'two
position' only - fully open or fully closed, and are operated
pneumatically by their respective solenoid control valve. The solenoid
control valves are scheduled by the EEC. When the bleed valves are open,
H.P. compressor air bleeds into the fan duct through ports in the inner
barrel of the 'C' ducts. The servo air used to operate the bleed valves
is H.P. compressor delivery air. The bleed valves are arranged radially
around the H.P. compressor case. Silencers are used on some bleed
valves. All the bleed valves are spring loaded to the open position and
as a result will always be in the correct position (open) for starting.
The bleed valves and the solenoid control valves operate in the same
manner. The bleed valve is a two-position valve and is either fully open
or fully closed. The bleed valve is spring loaded to the open position
and so all the bleed valves will be in the correct open position for
engine start. When the engine is started the bleed air will try to close
the valve. The valve is kept in the open position by servo air (P3)
supplied from the solenoid control valve, (solenoid de-energized) as
shown below. The EEC will close the bleed valves at the correct time
during acceleration. The bleed valve is closed by the EEC, which
energizes the solenoid control valve, as shown below. Energizing the
solenoid control valve vents the P3 servo air from the opening chamber
of the bleed valve, and the valve will move to the closed position.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL
(continued) BOOSTER STAGE BLEED VALVE FUNCTION The Booster Stage Bleed
Valve (BSBV) System discharges air from the Low Pressure compressor at
engine station 2.5 into the fan air duct. The BSBV gives improved surge
margin during engine start and transient operation. The bleed valve is
controlled by the EEC and is fully modulating, between the fully open
and the fully closed positions. For starting the BSBV is fully open and
will be progressively close during engine acceleration, while during
cruise and take off the valve is fully closed. For deceleration and
engine operation in reverse thrust the valve is fully open. In the event
of an engine surge the valve is opened to recover the airflow through
the compressor. The BSBV is a continuous ring valve that rotates and
slides forward to open and rearwards to close. Ten support arms are
driven via a lever and actuating rod by both BSBV actuators. The two
actuators use the high-pressure fuel from the FMU as a hydraulic medium.
The two BSBV actuators use pressurized fuel from the Fuel Metering Unit
(FMU) as a hydraulic medium. The actuators are located on the rear of
the intermediate casing on both sides of the High Pressure Compressor.
Only the left actuator interfaces with the EEC through a torque motor
and is identified as the Master Actuator. The actuator on the right hand
side is identified as the Slave Actuator. The two actuators are
hydraulically linked to carry out a simultaneous operation. The Master
Actuator includes a LVDT, which transmits the actuator position and
therefore the BSBV position to the EEC.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL
(continued) VSV SYSTEM Variable Stator Vanes control the entry of air
into the H.P. compressor. The variable vanes control the angle at which
the air enters the first three stages of the H.P. compressor. The angle
varies with the H.P. compressor speed (N2); this reduces the risk of
blade stall and compressor surge. The four stages of variable vanes
comprises Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) in front of stage 3 and the Variable
Stator Vanes (VSVs) behind the stages 3, 4, and 5. Mechanical
Arrangement Each vane has pivots at its inner and outer ends, which
allow the vane to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The outer end of
each vane is shaped into a shaft, which goes through the compressor case
and is attached by a short lever to a 'unison ring', (one unison ring
for each stage). Short rods to a crankshaft connect the five unison
rings. A short rod to an actuator that uses H.P. fuel as a hydraulic
operating medium connects the crankshaft. Signals from the EEC direct
the H.P. fuel to extend/retract the actuator. The actuator movement
causes the crankshaft to rotate, and, through the unison rings, moves
the variable stator vanes. The actuator has an LVDT, which sends
actuator positional information back to the EEC.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) TURBINE CLEARANCE CONTROL AND
TURBINE COOLING (continued) HP/LPTACC SYSTEM The EEC controls the
opening and closing of the ACC system by monitoring input signals of: .
Corrected N2 . Altitude The EEC commands an input signal to the torque
motor. The torque motor positions the jet pipe servo valve. The torque
motor can deflect the jet pipe servo valve to bias the direction of flow
of the servo fuel pressure. The jet pipe servo valve controls the
direction of flow of servo fuel pressure to effectively move the pilot
valve. The pilot valve moves and gets servo fuel pressure to either side
of the piston. Servo fuel pressure will act on one side of the piston at
any one time when a movement is required. The movement of the piston
moves a push pull rod that in turn operates the modulating air control
valve. When stabilisation of the piston is required the EEC will cancel
the input signal to the torque motor. This allows the jet pipe to return
to the central position and as a result of this the pilot valve will
move into the balanced position. Servo fuel pressure is now present on
both sides of the pilot valve. The spring will bias the pilot valve
position by forcing it to one side. The dual track LVDTs will send
feedback signals to the EEC of the ACC system operation.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) FAN AND CORE VENTILATION ZONES The
fan case and engine core compartments, which make the nacelle, are
ventilated to supply airflow around the engine during its operation.
Zone 1: the fan case and accessories are cooled by air taken in by a
scoop on the upper side of the air intake cowl. The air is then vented
overboard through two ventilation grilles at the bottom of each fan cowl
door. Zone 2: core compartment ventilation is supplied by fan air
through holes in the inner wall of the thrust reverser "C" ducts. The
air circulates into the core compartment and flows through the lower
bifurcation of the thrust reverser "C" ducts, then exits through the
thrust recovery nozzle.

ENGINE THRUST MANAGEMENT (3) BACK-UP N1 MODE Here are presented two
back-up N1 modes: - rated N1 mode, - unrated N1 mode.
RATED N1 MODE In case of EPR sensor failure, i.e. P2 or P4.9, the EEC
automatically reverts to the rated N1 mode. On the ECAM, the EPR
indicator is crossed amber. The EEC uses TLA, ADR and T2. T2 is used in
N1 rated mode to limit the engine thrust. To select N1 mode on both
engines, the Engine N1 MODE P/Bs must be pressed in. NOTE: The auto
thrust function is not available in N1 mode. When the N1 MODE P/Bs are
pressed in, the lights come ON and a signal is sent to their
corresponding Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system to
confirm or to force the N1 MODE selection. On the ECAM, the EPR
indicator is crossed amber and the N1 MODE limit is displayed instead of
the EPR limit. On the N1 indicator, the predicted N1, i.e. the cyan
circle, replaces the predicted EPR and an amber index appears to
indicate the take-off N1 limit.

THROTTLE CONTROL SYSTEM D/O (3) THROTTLE CONTROL LEVER The Throttle
control handle comprises: o a throttle control lever which incorporates
stop devices, autothrust instinctive disconnect pushbutton switch o a
graduated fixed sector o a reverse latching lever. The throttle control
lever is linked to a mechanical rod. This rod drives the input lever of
the throttle control artificial feel unit. The throttle control lever
moves over a range from -20 deg. TLA (Reverser Full Throttle stop) to
+45 deg. TLA: o -20 degrees TLA corresponds to Reverser Full Throttle
stop o +45 degrees TLA corresponds to Forward Full Throttle stop An
intermediate mechanical stop is set to 0 deg.TLA. This stop is
overridden when the reverse latching lever is pulled up for selection of
the reverse power. This stop is reset as soon as the throttle control
lever is selected back to forward thrust area. In the forward thrust
area, there are two detent points, the MAX CLIMB detent point set to 25
deg.TLA and the MAX CONTINUOUS/FLEX TAKE-OFF detent point set to 35
deg.TLA. In the reverse thrust throttle range, there is one detent point
at - 6 deg.TLA. This position agrees with the selection of the thrust
reverser command and the Reverse Idle setting. In the middle throttle
range (0deg. To 35 deg.TLA), the autothrust function can be active if
engaged. This range agrees with the selection of MAX CLIMB or MAX
CONTINUOUS thrust limit mode (in single operation). If the autothrust is
not engaged, the engine control is manual. In the forward range (35 deg.
To 45 deg.TLA), the autothrust function cannot be activated (except in
alpha floor condition).This range agrees with the selection of FLEX
TAKE-OFF/MAX TAKE-OFF Mode.

The throttle control unit comprises: -An input lever -Mechanical stops,
which limit the angular range -2 resolvers (one resolver per FADEC
(ECU/EEC) -6 potentiometers installed three by three -A device, which
drives the resolver and the potentiometer -A pin device for rigging the
resolver and potentiometers -1 switch whose signal is dedicated to the
EIU -2 output electrical connectors The input lever drives two gear
sectors assembled face to face. Each sector drives itself a set of one
resolver and three potentiometers. The relationship between the throttle
lever angle and throttle resolver angle (TRA) IS LINEAR AND 1 DEG.TLA =
1.9 TRA. The accuracy of the throttle control unit (error between the
input lever position and the resolver angle) is 0.5 deg.TRA. The maximum
discrepancy between the signals generated by two resolvers is 0.25
deg.TRA. The TLA resolver operates in two quadrants. The first quadrant
is used for positive angles and the second quadrant for negative angles.
Each resolver is dedicated to one FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) and receives
its electrical excitation current (6 VAC) from the related FADEC channel
(ECU / EEC) The ECU considers a throttle resolver angle value: o less
than -47.5 deg.TRA or o greater than 98.8 deg.TRA as resolver position
signal failure. The ECU includes a resolver fault accommodation logic.
This logic allows engine operation after a failure or a complete loss of
the throttle resolver position signal.

ENGINE MONITORING D/O (3) (AIDS). CFDS interface: maintenance fault
messages and vibration data analysis. AIDS interface: performance data
reports.
GENERAL This system provides the vibration monitoring for both engines.
NOTE: There is no interface with the Electronic Engine Control (EEC).
DUAL ACCELEROMETER A dual accelerometer is installed on each engine. It
provides the analog signals of N1 and N2 vibration frequencies. Only one
sensor, A or B, of the dual accelerometer is used at a time and during
one flight. It is automatically selected by the Engine Vibration
Monitoring Unit (EVMU) at each flight, the second one is in back-up mode
in case of failure. These accelerometers are also used for fan trim
balance. NOTE: In case of sensor failure, the transfer to the second
sensor is carried out on the ground through the MCDU.
EVMU An EVMU monitors the N1 and N2 vibration levels of both engines.
The EVMU determines for each engine, the N1 and N2 vibration levels by
analyzing: - N1 and N2 speeds, - dual accelerometer frequency signals.
The EVMU also computes the position and amplitude of the unbalance and
is capable of on-board fan trim balancing.
VIBRATION INDICATION The N1 and N2 vibrations of the left and right
engines are displayed on the ENGINE and CRUISE pages. The maximum value
that can be displayed is of 10 units. 1 unit for N1 or N2 rotor
corresponds to 0.3IPS (Inch Per Second).
INTERFACES The EVMU interfaces with the ECAM, with the Centralized Fault

vibration detected and sends it to the cockpit. Two channels come from
each engine. Each vibration transducer is installed in the fan case at
the top left side of the engine. It is attached with bolts and is
installed on a mounting plate.

THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) HYDRAULIC SUPPLY The thrust
reverser system is hydraulically actuated utilizing the aircraft
hydraulic pressure from the corresponding engine. The thrust reverser
system is isolated from the hydraulic supply by a Shut-Off Valve (SOV).
ACTUATION Each translating sleeve is operated by two hydraulic
actuators. The actuators receive fluid from the Hydraulic Control Unit
(HCU), which is controlled by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). When
the deploy sequence is commanded the pressure in the lower actuators
releases the locks as the four actuator pistons move rearward to deploy
the reverser. The actuators are linked together by a synchronizing
system.
REVERSER CONTROL Basically the thrust reverser system is controlled
through the EEC from the two reverser latching levers located on the
throttle control levers. The HCU has an isolation valve and a
directional valve to select deploy or stow mode. The directional valve
is operated to deploy only. For third defense line purposes, the Spoiler
Elevator Computers (SECs) have previously opened the SOV and the
hydraulic pressure is supplied to the HCU. Then, the Engine Interface
Unit (EIU) permits reverser deployment by energizing of the inhibition
relay, so the directional valve can be opened by the EEC. To command the
thrust reverser, the EEC needs an "aircraft on ground" signal supplied
by the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs).
REVERSER INDICATING The actual state of the thrust reverser is shown on
the upper ECAM, REV indication appears in the middle of the Engine
Pressure Ratio (EPR) dial. The signals come from the lock sensor and the
Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT).

maintenance purposes or to increase aircraft dispatch, the HCU is fitted
with a manual deactivation lever to inhibit the thrust reverser system.
In case of an inoperative thrust reverser, lockout pins stowed on the
translating sleeves have to be installed to complete the deactivation
procedure. WARNING: THE THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM SHOULD BE INHIBITED USING
THE HCU DEACTIVATION LEVER BEFORE WORKING ON THE SYSTEM OR ON THE

THRUST REVERSER MANAGEMENT (3) GENERAL The thrust reverser system is
controlled independently for each engine by the associated Full
Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system.
THRUST REVERSER ACTUATION The hydraulic power required for the actuators
is supplied by the normal aircraft hydraulic system: - Green system for
engine 1, - Yellow system for engine 2. A Shut-Off Valve (SOV) located
upstream of the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) make up an independent
locking system. Each channel of the Electronic Engine Control (EEC)
controls and monitors solenoid valves included in the HCU, which
provides the deployment and stowage of two translating sleeves. Internal
locks in the lower actuators are hydraulically operated. The operation
of the actuators is synchronized by flexible drive shafts inside the
deploy hydraulic lines, i.e. the synchronizing system. The HCU includes
an isolation valve, a pressure switch and a directional valve, which is
controlled through the inhibition relay.

OIL SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The engine oil system includes 3 circuits: -
a supply circuit, - a scavenge circuit, - a vent circuit. The oil system
lubricates and cools the bearings in the 3 bearing compartments. It also
lubricates bearings and gears in the Angle Gearbox (AGB) and Main
Gearbox (MGB). Oil cooling is controlled by a dedicated heat management
system, which makes sure that engine oil, Integrated Drive Generator
(IDG) oil and fuel temperatures are maintained within limits. The oil
system is a dry sump full flow type system. The single pressure pump is
independent of the 6 scavenge pumps (standard gear type). The 6 scavenge
pumps are mounted on the MGB. The major components of the oil system
are: oil tank, pressure and scavenge pumps, Fuel Cooled Oil Cooler
(FCOC) and Air Cooled Oil Cooler (ACOC). Other components are a pressure
filter included in the pressure pump, a scavenge filter, a de-oiler, a
scavenge valve, chip detectors and sensors.

pressure relief valve opens at 450 PSI. The pressurized oil that is
filtered and then cooled by the Heat Exchangers according to the HMS
control, is routed to each of the 3 bearing compartments, to the Angle
gearbox and also the Main gearbox. The oil supply has: - an Low Oil
Pressure (LOP) switch , - an Oil Pressure transmitter, These sensors are
used for the ECAM indication and monitoring. The oil supply to the oil

master chip detector for inspection, - an oil temperature sensor for
indication, - an oil differential pressure switch which is used for
monitoring and warning to the cockpit when the scavenge filter is
clogged. If the scavenge filter becomes clogged a differential pressure
switch sends a signal to the ECAM and eventually the by-pass valve will
open. The ECAM is activated when the differential pressure is greater
than 12 PSI. The by-pass valve opens at 20 PSI. NOTE: The scavenge line
of the No. 4 bearing compartment is controlled by the No. 4 bearing

OIL SYSTEM D/O (3) NO. 4 BEARING Oil and vent air from the No. 4 bearing
compartment is scavenged through a common line. This dual-purpose line
is piped through the two-position No. 4 bearing scavenge valve (and then
continues to the deoiler). The two-position scavenge valve opens to the
maximum flow area at low power to maximum scavenging. At high power this
valve closes to the minimum area to maintain the seal pressure
differentials and reduce overboard loss of vent air. The valve operates
in the following manner. There are two basic operating positions, low
power and high power. In the low-power position, where the compressor
10th stage pressure (P10) is less than 150 PSI, the valve is held spring
loaded in the fully open position. The bearing compartment scavenge flow
goes through the valve, restricted only by the porting in the valve
seat. As the engine power increases, the P10 pressure rises. When this
pressure exceeds 150 psi, the valve moves away from the max flow stop.
This is due to the pressure acting on the differential areas of the
valve and overcoming the spring load. The valve moves towards the min
flow or high power setting. As the valve moves towards the peripheral
ports in the seat, totally closing these ports, the flow through the
valve is now restricted to one central port in the valve seat. Full
travel is achieved at P10 pressure of approximately 210 psi. As the
valve moves away from the max flow stop, the influence of the magnets on
the reed switch decreases and the reed switch opens. The circuit is
broken, indicating that the valve has moved. As the engine power
decreases, the spring load overcomes the decreasing P10 pressure. The
valve moves towards the max flow or low power position, uncovering the
ports in the valve seat and restoring maximum flow through the valve. As
the valve approaches the maximum flow stop, the influence of the magnets
on the reed switch increases. The reed switch closes, completing the
circuit and indicating the valve position.

The function of the No.4 bearing indicating system is to monitor the
correct operation of the No.4 bearing 2-position scavenge valve and to
detect a No.4 bearing carbon-seal failure. The No.4 bearing pressure
transducer is installed on the right side of the deoiler and senses
pressure at the No.4 bearing outlet line. The position indicator is
integral with the No.4 bearing scavenge valve which is located in the
No.4 bearing compartment scavenge line. At engine low power, the valve
is open and the switch closes sending a ground signal. At engine high
power, the valve closes and the switch opens. The EIU has two logics,
allowing the monitoring of the No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve operation as
well as the No. 4 bearing carbon seal failure.

DOORS OPENING (continued) THRUST REVERSER COWL DOORS OPENING Before you
start work, make sure you follow all the safety precautions as outlined
in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual. Put a warning notice on the center
pedestal to tell people not to start the engine. In the same way put a
warning notice on the overhead maintenance panel to make sure that the
FADEC Ground Power pushbutton stays in the off position. Open the fan
cowl doors. Gain access to the hydraulic control unit lever and
de-activate the thrust reverser system. Now open the thrust reverser
pressure relief doors on the bottom of the nacelle. Remove the auxiliary
latch assembly from its retention clip on the left hand thrust reverser
half and make sure that the latch is adjusted to its minimum length
before engaging the auxiliary latch assembly in the hook on the right
hand thrust reverser half. Turn the body of the auxiliary latch assembly
with a spanner to pull the thrust reverser halves closer together and to
relieve the tension on the latches. Once the tension is relieved release
the five latches in the following order according to the Aircraft
Maintenance Manual. The latches are counted from forward to aft. They
are released in the following order: 3 - 2 - 5 and then 6 - 4 - 1. -
Begin with the latch in position number 3, the middle bifurcation
latch, - continue with latch number 2, the forward bifurcation latch, -
release the translating sleeve double latch in positions 5 and 6, - then
the aft bifurcation latch, number 4,

    make the red flag of the hold open device appear. Turn the auxiliary
    latch assembly to make it longer and disengage it from the hook on
    the right hand thrust reverser half. Then stow the auxiliary latch
    assembly into its retention clip. Before opening the thrust reverser
    cowl doors make certain that the slats are retracted and the
    translating sleeves stowed. The thrust reverser cowl doors are
    opened using a hydraulic hand pump. Make sure the hand pump
    reservoir is filled with the correct type of oil. Remove the
    protection cap and connect the hose of the hand pump to the
    quick-disconnect on the thrust reverser half. Close the valve on the
    hand pump. Now operate the hand pump until the thrust reverser half
    is fully open The thrust reverser half is held open by two hold open
    rods stowed inside the thrust reverser half: Open the clip assembly
    to release the aft hold-open rod. Push the lock arm and fully extend
    the hold open rod until it locks in the fully extended position.
    While the rod plunger is held close to the anchorage bracket on the
    engine, the valve on the hand pump is slowly opened until the
    plunger engages. Close the valve on the hand pump again. Release the
    forward hold open rod from its clip assembly and hold it in position
    in its bracket on the engine. Open the valve on the hand pump so
    that the plunger of the forward hold open rod engages. Now the

USING THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT (HCU) LEVER, BEFORE WORKING ON THE
SYSTEM OR ON THE ENGINE. IF NOT THE THRUST REVERSER CAN ACCIDENTALLY
OPERATE AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES TO PERSONNEL AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE
REVERSER. This procedure is carried out when a fault occurs on a thrust
reverser which can not be repaired for the next flight. Deactivation and
lockout are therefore provided to secure the translating sleeves in
stowed position when the aircraft has to be dispatched with an
inoperative thrust reverser. Before working on the engine safety
precautions have to be taken in the cockpit. On Panel 115 VU put a
warning notice to tell people not to start the engines. On the Overhead
Panel, panel 50 VU, make sure that the on legend from the FADEC Ground
Power switch is off and install a warning notice. Open the fan cowl
doors and put the access platform into position. Deactivate the Thrust
Reverser HCU by removing the quick release pin from the stowage position
on the HCU. Move the inhibition lever to the OFF position and insert the
quick release pin. Make sure that the translating sleeves are in the
fully retracted position. If not move them manually to the retracted
position in accordance to the AMM procedure. The following deactivation
procedure needs to be done on both translating sleeves of the related
engine. Remove the plug from the lockout assembly on the outside of the
translating sleeve. Remove the lockout pin from the stowage position on
the outside of the translating sleeve.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
Make sure that the lockout pin and the plug are cleaned and that anti
seize material is applied to the threads of both components before you
continue with the deactivation procedure. Install the lockout pin in the
lockout assembly of the translating sleeve. Install the plug in the
lockout pin stowage bracket assembly of the translating sleeve NOTE:
Note: For easy identification of a deactivated thrust reverser, the red
colored lockout pin will stand out of the structure of the translating
sleeve when installed in the lockout assembly. Do an operational test of
the thrust reverser system with the CFDS in accordance to the AMM.
Energize the related EEC with the FADEC Ground Power Pushbutton Switch
on panel 50VU. Get access to the CFDS System Report Test, select next
page and select the line key next to engine. Select the line key related
to the FADEC 1A or 1B menu and activate the interactive test by
selecting the line key next to System Test and Reverser Test. Obey the
cautions and warnings in the AMM and on the MCDU before you start the
Reverser Test to prevent any injury to personnel or damage to equipment.

MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS (2) FAN MODULE - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION WARNING: BE
CAREFUL DURING THE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION OF THE FAN MODULE, IT WEIGHS
APPROXIMATELY 395 LBS (179 KG). PUT APPROVED GLOVES ON YOUR HANDS BEFORE
YOU HOLD THE FAN BLADES. THE LEADING EDGES OF THE FAN BLADES CAN CAUSE
INJURY TO YOUR HANDS. BE CAREFUL DURING THE ASSEMBLY OF THE CANTILEVER
SLING AND THE SLING ADAPTER, THE SLING WEIGHS 165 LBS (75 KG) AND THE
ADAPTER WEIGHS 74 LBS (34 KG). DO NOT GET ENGINE OIL ON YOUR SKIN FOR A
LONG TIME, THE OIL IS POISONOUS AND CAN GO THROUGH YOUR SKIN AND INTO
YOUR BODY. CAUTION: Do not touch the stage 1 fan disk with tools when
you loosen or remove the curvic coupling bolts. There are twenty-four
curvic coupling bolts which attach the fan module to the LP
compressor/intermediate case module. During removal of the fan module,
keep three of the bolts in position until after the installation of the
support and slinging tools. Observe the correct untorque procedure and
place the hub protector. Make sure that the quick-release pin is
installed in the inner holes in the cantilever sling bracket before
moving the fan module/slinging assembly. Put two persons on each side of
the fan module before moving the fan module/sling tool assembly. Make
sure that the quick-release pin is installed in the inner holes in the
cantilever sling bracket before moving the fan module/slinging tool
assembly.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
Do not touch the stage 1 fan disk with tools when you install or tighten
the curvic coupling bolts. Do not use a power wrench to tighten the
bolts. The use of a power wrench can cause damage to the bolts. When you
torque the curvic coupling bolts, it is important that the torque value
is on the increase. A new bolt must be installed if the torque value is
constant or decreases. For this operation, the air inlet cowl must be
removed first, then remove the inlet cone and its fairing. There are 25
curvic bolts which attach the fan module. Put hub protectors and remove
21 out of 24 bolts observing the unscrew procedure. The three bolts
adjacent to the guide pins of the stub shaft remain in position. Next,
the hub protectors are removed to install the sling adapter. Then the
sling adapter is fixed. Using the hoist, connect the cantilever sling to
the sling adapter. Secure the sling adapter with a quick-release pin.
Using the adjustment handle, align the hoisting plate to the witness
mark. Remove the remaining three curvic bolts and carefully move FWD the
fan assembly making sure that nothing hits against the fan case. The fan
module is reinstalled with the same precautions. Use the correlation
mark and the U slot of the stub shaft to align the fan disk. Make sure
that the fan module is correctly engaged and secure it with the curvic
bolts at two, four, eight and ten o'clock position. Then remove the
sling adapter with the cantilever sling. Install and tighten the other
curvic bolts. Finally, reinstall the air inlet cowl and the inlet cone.
When leaving the work area, make sure that the air intake is clear and
clean of tools.

MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS (2) IDG - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION WARNING: BE
CAREFUL DURING THE REMOVAL OR THE INSTALLATION OF THE INTEGRATED DRIVE
GENERATOR (IDG), IT WEIGHS 124 LBS (60 KG). DO NOT LET ENGINE OIL ON
YOUR SKIN FOR A LONG TIME, THE OIL IS POISONOUS AND CAN GO THROUGH YOUR
SKIN AND INTO YOUR BODY. DO NOT TOUCH THE FUEL OR OIL SYSTEM COMPONENTS
FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER THE ENGINE SHUTDOWN, THE ENGINE COMPONENTS STAY
HOT FOR SOME TIME AND CAN CAUSE INJURY.
Before removing the IDG, the engine must be shut down for at least 5
minutes to prevent burns because the oil stays hot for a few minutes.
First of all, the IDG must be drained and the oil tubes disconnected and
removed. Also remove the banjo couplings and note their initial
positions. Then disconnect the three electrical connectors from the IDG.
Remove the cover plate of the IDG terminal box and disconnect the output
cables. Next place the special dolly in position and raise it up to the
IDG. When the IDG is on the dolly, release the quick-attach/detach
coupling then pull the IDG FWD to disengage it. Let's now see the IDG
installation. Using the dolly, lift the IDG up to its position and align
the open marks on the quick-attach/detach coupling. When the IDG is
engaged, tighten the coupling sufficiently to secure it, then remove the
dolly, reconnect the electrical connectors and reinstall the oil tubes.
CAUTION: Do not let engine oil fall on the engine, unwanted oil must be
removed immediately. The oil can cause damage to the surface protection
and to some parts. Help the IDG out in a straight line, the input shaft
can catch and cause damage to the input seal. Do not use external parts
or tools to pull the IDG from the gearbox, they can cause damage. Do not
apply side loads which could bend the splined drive shaft during the
installation of the IDG. A bent splined drive shaft will prevent correct
installation of the IDG and damage it in operation. Make sure that you
do not damage the input seal during the installation of the IDG. Make
sure that the tubes are not stressed, this can cause damage. The square
washers must be installed between the phase cables and the terminal
block on the IDG to prevent the terminal block becoming hot and causing
damage to the IDG.

CONTAINER BEFORE YOU CONNECT THE DRAIN HOSE TO THE OVERFLOW DRAIN VALVE.
MAKE SURE THAT THE DRAIN HOSE HANGS DOWN VERTICALLY AND THE END OF THE
HOSE IS ABOVE THE OIL LEVEL IN THE CONTAINER. WHEN YOU CONNECT THE DRAIN
HOSE TO THE IDG, YOU RELEASE THE OIL PRESSURE AND OIL WILL SPRAY FROM
THE DRAIN HOSE. YOU MUST PUT THE DRAIN HOSE ON THE OVERFLOW DRAIN VALVE
BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE CASE DRAIN PLUG. THE INSTALLATION OF THE DRAIN

IDG OIL SYSTEM.
service the IDG oil system, do not mix types or brands of oil. Let the
temperature of the IDG decrease to 120°F (48,8°C) or less before you
drain the oil. Do not touch the IDG system components for a short time
after the engine is shut down. The engine components stay hot for some
time and can cause injury. If the oil is below the minimum level, the
green band, add oil to the IDG. Now prepare the IDG for servicing.
Remove the caps from the overflow drain and pressure fill valves. First
connect a drain hose to the overflow drain valve then connect the
pressure fill hose from a service unit to the pressure fill valve. Using
the service units, add oil, until the level reaches the full mark and
the oil overflows through the drain hose. Drain oil until the oil level
moves down to the green band. Remove the drain and pressure fill hoses
from connectors and reinstall the caps. Finally perform a leak test. Do
another check of the oil level 5 minutes later. NOTE: This procedure is
to let the air escape from the IDG oil system and to let the oil flow
around the system.
CAUTION: Do not let engine oil fall on the engine, unwanted oil must be
removed immediately. The oil can cause damage to the surface protection
and to some parts. The drain hose must be connected to let the oil in
the IDG drain to the correct level. The IDG can become too hot if it
contains too much oil. Do not operate the IDG without sufficient or with
too much oil, this will cause damage to the IDG. When you

POWER PLANT SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) ENGINE OIL SERVICING CAUTION:
Caution: The engine should be shut down for at least 5 minutes prior to
oil servicing. This allows the residual pressure in the oil tank to
decrease. If you open the filler cap when there is pressure in the tank
the hot oil can spray out and burn you. NOTE: Note: If possible, the
engine oil should be checked and serviced within 5 to 60 minutes after
shutdown. Note: If the engine has been shutdown more 1 hour but less
than 10 hours, start the engine and run at idle for 3 minutes prior to
servicing. Note: If the engine has been shut down for 10 hours or more,
you must dry crank the engine followed by an engine start and idle run
of at least 3 minutes duration. This is to ensure that the oil level
shown in the tank is correct before oil is added. - open engine oil
service door on left fan cowl, - check oil level on the sight gage on
the oil tank, - raise filler cap handle to vertical (unlocked
position), - turn the oil filler cap to remove, - add oil as necessary
up to the FULL mark on the sight gage, - install oil filler cap - make
sure to LOCK the cap. NOTE: Note: It is also possible to Pressure Fill

MEL / DEACTIVATION (continued) TEST SET OF 7TH and 10TH STAGE BLEED
VALVE AND SOLENOID When you do the test of the bleed valve, listen
carefully to the bleed valve. If necessary, use the stethoscope supplied
with the test set. If possible, use a light source (torch and mirror) to
see the movement of the bleed valve. If you hear a click when the bleed
valve closes or if you see the bleed valve move, the test is correct
(PASS). If there is no movement of the bleed valve, the test is not
correct (FAIL). If you are not sure, remove the silencer and do an
inspection for physical movement. To do the test of the solenoid, it is
important to put a WARNING NOTICE(S) to tell persons not to start the
engine. Use the hand pump to get 20 psi on the solenoid input pressure
gauge. Read the value on the solenoid output pressure gauge. The test is
correct (PASS) if the solenoid output pressure increases quickly to
+0/-5 psi of solenoid input pressure. It is possible that the pressure
on the two gauges will slowly decrease. If the pressure continues to
decrease for more than 5 seconds, this is acceptable. The test is not
correct (FAIL) if the difference between the solenoid output pressure
and the solenoid input pressure is more than 5 psi. If the pressure
decreases for less than 5 seconds, reject the solenoid. Then, the Green
CONTINUITY light comes on and the solenoid output pressure is zero. (It
is possible that the solenoid output pressure gauge will momentarily
show a pressure value when the TEST SWITCH pushbutton is pushed. This is
acceptable.) If the CONTINUITY light does not come on or if the solenoid
output pressure is more than zero, the test is not correct (FAIL) (it is
possible that an indication will be shown momentarily when you push the

POWER PLANT SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS The engine and
pylon drain system is designed to collect fuel, oil, water and hydraulic
fluid from engine systems and accessories and discharge them overboard
through the engine drain mast and the pylon drain tubes. For
troubleshooting and leak isolation the drain mast body has separate
drains identified and visible with the cowls closed. The pylon drain
tubes collect fluids from individual pylon chambers, also for leak
isolation. If fluid leaks are found during transit operations, run the
engine at idle for 5 minutes. If the leak stops, the aircraft may be
dispatched without maintenance action. If leaks continue after 5
minutes, consult the AMM (ATA 71-70) for maximum permitted leakage
limits for all of the drains. There are 2 limits for each drain. If the
first limit is exceeded, the aircraft may be dispatched and can continue
to operate for a maximum of 25 hours or 10 flights as long as the second
limit is not exceeded. Here are some examples of engine drains with both
leakage limits. See the AMM for complete list.

MANUAL OPERATION OF THRUST REVERSER SLEEVES (3) Make sure that the A/C
is in the same configuration as for the manual deploying task.
MANUAL DEPLOYMENT and stowage procedure WARNING: THE THRUST REVERSER
SYSTEM SHOULD BE DEACTIVATED USING THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT (HCU)
LEVER, BEFORE WORKING ON THE SYSTEM OR ON THE ENGINE. IF NOT THE THRUST
REVERSER CAN ACCIDENTLY OPERATE AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES TO PERSONNEL
AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE REVERSER. Before the manual deployment of the
translating sleeves some precautions have to be taken in the cockpit. On
the ENGine START panel, check that the MASTER lever is at OFF position
and install a warning notice. On the maintenance panel, make sure that
the ENGine FADEC GrouND PoWeR SWitch is OFF and install a warning
notice. Gain access to the HCU, move the lever to the OFF position to
deactivate the thrust reverser system and install the safety pin. Gain
access to the manually by-passable non-return valve by removing the
corresponding pylon access panel. Now, move the non-return valve lever
to the bypass position. After that, on the lower actuator move the lock
lever to the unlocked position, this releases the actuator and permits
manual deployment. Before operating, check that the flexible shaft is
correctly engaged inside the manual drive, then insert a speed wrench
into the manual drive shaft and deploy the translating sleeves. When
looking FWD, you can see the blocker doors moving. With the translating
sleeves deployed the cascades are accessible. To stow the translating
sleeves, reverse the procedure. When the translating sleeves reach the
fully stowed position the lock lever on the lower actuator automatically
engages. Then return the manually by-passable non-return valve lever to
the normal position and reactivate the thrust reverser system through
the HCU lever. Finally, in the cockpit remove the warning notices. NOTE:
Both translating sleeves move together due to the synchronizing system.

ENGINE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION (3) ENGINE REMOVAL Before the removal
operation the engine systems must be deactivated and isolated from the
aircraft, and all the connections disconnected from the pylon
interfaces. To support the cowl doors during the operation hold-open
braces are installed. Then the engine trolley and cradle are placed
under the engine. To support the engine during removal and
transportation fixtures are installed at handling points on the fan case
and also on the turbine rear frame. On the FWD engine mount, each bolt
is loosened and retorqued to the maximum force an operator using a
standard wrench can apply. The center hinge clamp of the FWD bootstrap
is then fixed on the pyramid where hinge arms will be installed. The
rear beam of the bootstrap equipment is fixed on the pylon lower part,
then the dynamometers and chain pulley blocks are installed. Disconnect
the engine cradle from the trolley and raise the cradle to the engine
using the four chain pulley blocks. When the cradle reaches the engine
handling points secure the supports on the front and on the rear parts.
Loosen and remove the bolts of the FWD mount, then the bolts of the aft
mount through an access provided when the hinge access panel is removed.
Make sure that no lines or unions remain connected to the pylon and
lower the engine using the four chain pulley blocks, also check that the
engine mounts disengage correctly from their attaches. Slowly continue
the descent until the cradle touches the trolley. Then secure and lock
it. Remove the chain hoists and the FWD hinge arms, then the chain
pulley blocks and dynamometers from the rear beam. Now push forward the
engine from under the pylon, making sure that nothing catches. With the
engine removed it is now possible to see the aft and FWD mounts in more
detail and also the front hinge clamp and the rear beam installation.
Notice the hold-open brace which holds the thrust reverser cowl door in
the open position.

ENGINE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION (3) ENGINE installation All the
equipment is re-installed to provide the engine lifting. Start the
lifting using the pulley levers and check that the dynamometers show the
correct load. Raise the engine cradle gradually. As the engine reaches
the pylon take care that the FWD and rear mounts engage correctly. Then
install the bolts to both mounts and tighten them. Note that you never
use the same bolts. Always change them for new or inspected ones. When
the engine cradle is on the trolley remove the four chain pulley blocks
and dynamometers, then the bootstrap equipment. Reconnect all lines and
electrical harnesses to the pylon interfaces. Finally lock the cradle to
the trolley. Push the trolley out from under the engine and remove the
hold-open braces from the cowls. The engine can now be put back in
serviceable condition. NOTE: Avoid any dynamic effect during descent.
