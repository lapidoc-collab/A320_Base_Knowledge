AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The air
conditioning system main function is to keep the air in the pressurized
fuselage compartments at the correct pressure and temperature. In
details, this system provides the following functions: - cabin
temperature control, - pressurization control, - avionics ventilation, -
cargo compartment ventilation &amp; heating (optional).

FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY
AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) For the zones in which
warmer temperatures are necessary, the ACSC sends a signal to the
related TRIM AIR VALVE to open. Hot air mixes with the Mixer Unit
discharge air and the temperature increases.
SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) CABIN TEMPERATURE CONTROL The Single Aisle
family has two air conditioning packs installed in the wing root area,
forward of the landing gear bay. The packs supply conditioned air to the
cabin for air conditioning, ventilation and pressurization. The primary
component of each pack assembly is the air cycle machine. Hot air from
the pneumatic system is supplied to the pack through the pack Flow
Control Valve (FCV). The FCV adjusts the flow rate through the pack and
is the pack shut-off valve. During normal operation, the Air
Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) calculates the flow mass demand
and sets the flow control valve in the necessary reference position. The
pack temperature control system controls the pack outlet temperature and
sets its maximum and minimum limits. The system includes two ACSCs. Each
ACSC controls one pack. To control the pack outlet temperature, the ACSC
modulates the BYPASS VALVE and the RAM-AIR INLET doors. The packs supply
the mixer unit. Three separate aircraft zones are supplied from the
mixer unit: - cockpit, - forward cabin, - aft cabin. Two cabin
recirculation fans are installed to reduce the bleed air demand and
therefore save fuel. These fans establish a recirculation flow of air
from the cabin zones to the mixer unit. In normal operation, there are
no ECAM indications associated with the cabin fans. The ACSC controls
and monitors the temperature regulation system for the cabin zones. On
the overhead AIR COND panel, the flight crew selects the desired
individual compartment temperature. The hot air system for cabin
temperature control has a trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) and
trim air valves controlled by the ACSC.

safety. The pressurized areas are: - the cockpit, - the avionics bay, -
the cabin, - the cargo compartments. The concept of the system is
simple. Air is supplied from the air conditioning packs to the
pressurized areas. An outflow valve is used to adjust the quantity of
air that is released from the pressurized cabin. Automatic control of
the outflow valve is provided by two Cabin Pressure Controllers (CPCs).
Each CPC controls one electric motor on the outflow valve assembly. The
CPCs interface with other aircraft computers to optimize the
pressurization / depressurization schedule. There are two automatic
pressurization systems. Each CPC and its electric motor make up one
system. Only one system operates at a time with the other system acting
as backup in case of a failure. The system in command will alternate
each flight. A third motor is installed for manual operation of the
outflow valve in case both automatic systems fail. To protect the
fuselage against excessive cabin differential pressure, safety valves
are installed on the rear pressure bulkhead. The safety valves also
protect against negative differential pressure. The Residual Pressure
Control Unit (R PCU) prevents residual pressure in the cabin and takes
over the control of the outflow valve automatically. To do this, it
supplies power directly to the manual motor of the outflow valve.

(continued) AVIONICS VENTILATION The avionics ventilation system
supplies cooling air to the avionics equipment. This includes the
equipment in the avionics compartment, the flight deck instruments and
the circuit breaker panels. A blower fan and an extraction fan supply
the air through the avionics equipment. NOTE: Note: These fans operate
continuously while the aircraft electrical system is supplied. The
Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) controls the fans and the
configuration of the skin valves in the avionics ventilation system
based on flight / ground logic and fuselage skin temperature. There are
3 configurations for the skin air inlet and outlet valves: - open
circuit: the two valves are open (on ground only), - closed circuit: the
two valves are closed (in flight or if there is low external air
temperature on ground). The air temperature is decreased in the skin
heater exchanger. The skin heat exchanger is a chamber which lets the
air be in contact with the fuselage skin during flight, - intermediate
circuit: the inlet is closed and the outlet is open, but not fully.

(continued) CARGO VENTILATION AND HEATING As an option on the Airbus
single aisle family, the forward and aft cargo compartments can have a
ventilation system. A heating system can also be installed in these two
compartments or only one of them. The heating system will only be
installed together with a ventilation system. The operation is
equivalent for the two compartments, thus we will only look at the
forward cargo compartment as an example. Air from the main cabin is
supplied into the cargo compartment by the extract fan or by
differential pressure in flight (FWD Cargo Compartment only). After its
circulation through the compartment, the air is discharged overboard.
The operation of the two isolation valves and the extract fan is
controlled automatically by the cargo Ventilation Controller (VC). One
VC can control one cargo compartment or the two of them. For the heating
of the cargo compartment, the pilots select the desired compartment temp
and hot bleed air is mixed with the air coming from the main cabin to
increase the temperature if necessary. The supply of hot air is
controlled by the Cargo Heating Controller. Each heated compartment has
a dedicated Cargo Heating Controller. There is NO direct air
conditioning supply to the cargo compartments. The pilots cannot add
"cold" air to the compartments.

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) BASIC PRINCIPLE
AIR DISTRIBUTION
The flow of hot air from the air bleed system is regulated before it
enters the packs in order to be temperature regulated. Hot air pressure
is maintained above the cabin pressure, which lets the hot airflow join
the pack air supply when necessary. Part of the cabin air is
recirculated to decrease air supply demand.
The conditioned air is distributed to three main zones: - cockpit, -
forward cabin, - aft cabin. Normally, the mixer unit lets the cockpit be
supplied from pack 1 and FWD and aft cabins from pack 2.
PACK UNITS The airflow from the air bleed system is regulated by two
pack Flow Control Valves (FCVs). Two independent packs then supply air
with a regulated temperature to the mixer unit. Both packs supply air at
the same temperature.
LAV AND GALY VENTILATION The LAVatory and GALleY ventilation system uses
air from the cabin zones. A fan extracts this air through the outflow
valve. NOTE: Note: The LAV and GALY ventilation system is also used to
ventilate the cabin zone temperature sensors.
MIXER UNIT The mixer unit mixes air with a regulated temperature from
the packs with part of the cabin air supplied by the recirculation fans.
The mixer unit can also receive conditioned air from an LP ground
connection or fresh outside air from the emergency ram air inlet. The
emergency ram air inlet supplies outside fresh air for ventilation of
the A/C in emergency conditions when there is loss of both packs or
smoke removal.
ACSC The Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) does: - temperature
regulation in accordance with demand, - flow control and monitoring in
accordance with flow control demand.
TRIM AIR PRV Hot air tapped upstream of the packs supplies the trim air
valves through a trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV). This valve
regulates the downstream pressure 4 psi above the cabin pressure.
HOT TRIM AIR A trim air valve associated with each zone optimizes the
temperature by adding hot air, if necessary, to the air from the mixer
unit.

PACK PRESENTATION (2) PACK FCV Each pack Flow Control Valve (FCV) is
pneumatically actuated and electrically controlled. The flow regulation
is done by a torque motor under the control of the Air Conditioning
System Controller (ACSC). If the pack compressor outlet temperature is
&gt; 215°C (419°F), the FCV starts to reduce the flow. A compressor outlet
temperature &gt; 260°C (500°F) results in a pack overheat warning.
the exchangers. To increase cooling, the ram air inlet flap opens more
and the BYP valve closes more. To increase heating, the ram air inlet
flap closes more and the BYP valve opens more. During take-off and
landing, the ram air inlet flap is closed to prevent ingestion of
foreign objects.
NOTE: Note: Part of the hot air, downstream of the pack FCV, is sent to
the trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV). Each pack FCV is
automatically closed during either a same side engine start sequence or
an opposite side engine start sequence, if the crossbleed valve is
detected open. It reopens 30 seconds after the end of any engine start
sequence.
EXCHANGERS - COMPRESSOR Bleed air is ducted to the primary heat
exchanger, then to the compressor. The air is cooled in the main heat
exchanger. It then goes through the reheater, the condenser and the
water extractor in order to remove water particles from the air entering
the turbine.
TURBINE The air expands in the turbine section, which results in a very
low turbine discharge air temperature. The turbine drives the compressor
and the cooling air fan.
RAM AIR INLET FLAP AND BYP VALVE The BYPass valve and the ram air inlet
flap are simultaneously controlled by the air conditioning system
controller. The BYP valve is operated by an electro-mechanical actuator
to modulate the pack discharge temperature by adding hot air. The ram
air inlet flap modulates the airflow through

flow regulation is a function of the torque motor controlled by the
related ACSC compared with the flow setting on panel 30VU. The ACSC uses
the signal from the DIFFERENTIAL PRESS SENSOR to determine the air flow
that goes through the pack. ACSC 1 only does the air flow calculation.
The signal is then sent to ACSC 2 for the flow control of pack 2. In
some special aircraft configurations, the air flow is set to a specified
value. These default settings are: HIGH FLOW: - during pack operation
with the APU bleed air supply, - during single pack operation. LOW
FLOW: - during take-off and landing. The PACK INLET PRESSURE SENSOR is
used to calculate the bleed air necessary for the pack operation.

air from the condenser is sent through the WATER EXTRACTOR. Guide vanes
will supply this air at high speed and centrifugal forces will extract
the water from the air flow. The extracted water is injected into the
ram air duct through the WATER INJECTOR. This increases the cooling
efficiency of the primary and main heat exchangers. This is usually done
only on ground or in low altitudes.
REHEATER The air, which then contains almost no water, goes to the
REHEATER. The REHEATER uses warm air from the main heat exchanger outlet
to increase again the temperature of the cold air that comes from the
water extractor. This is necessary to vaporize the last remaining water
droplets before the air is sent to the ACM turbine and to prevent damage
to the turbine.

temperature. To adjust the temperature, the ACSC sends an electrical
signal to the stepper motor of the Bypass Valve (BYP VLV). When
controlled to a more open position, the valve bypasses hot air from the
ACM compressor inlet around the ACM to the turbine outlet and thus
increases the outlet temperature of the pack. This temperature control
is used for short term and for a fast pack response.
RAM AIR ACTUATOR For long term pack temperature control, the ACSC
modulates the ram air cooling flow through the heat exchangers. To do
this, it controls the position of the RAM AIR ACTUATOR and thus the
position of the ram air inlet flap. The position of the ram air inlet
flap is monitored by the SPEED AND DIRECTION SENSOR attached to the
actuator. In some special aircraft configurations (take-off and
landing), the ram air flap is controlled to the fully closed position to
prevent dirt ingestion from the nose landing gear.
ACM FAN During aircraft operation on ground, the ACM FAN is used to
supply cooling air around the primary and the main heat exchangers. In
flight with ram air available, the fan will be bypassed to prevent a
negative effect on the ACM operation.

FLOW CONTROL &amp; PACK COMPONENTS D/O (3) PACK DISCHARGE PRESSURE SENSOR
The ACSC uses the PACK DISCHARGE PRESS SENSOR to compare the cabin
pressure with the turbine outlet pressure. If the difference between
these two pressure values is more than a specified limit, then there can
be icing at the condenser This causes the ACSC to command the bypass
valve (BYP VLV) to a more open position and hot air flows directly into
the turbine outlet airflow. This hot air will melt the ice at the
condenser, which causes the pack discharge pressure to get back to a
normal value. When the pressure values are below the activation
threshold, the bypass valve goes back to the normal temperature
regulating position.

FLOW CONTROL &amp; PACK COMPONENTS D/O (3) PACK OVERHEAT DETECTION To
prevent a pack overheat, the ACSC monitors the COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE TEMP
SENSOR. The ACSC will send a signal to the RAM AIR INLET ACTUATOR if the
temperature increases to more than 180°C. This will cause an increase of
the cooling airflow around the heat exchangers and an overheat condition
will be prevented. If there is no positive effect on the compressor
outlet temperature, the ACSC will send a signal to the torque motor of
the FCV to control it to a more closed position. This will decrease the
hot air supply into the pack. At a temperature of 260°C and with the
aircraft on ground, the ACSC will close the FCV and send a signal to the
panel 30VU. This signal causes the FAULT light in the related PACK
pushbutton switch to come on. In flight, the FCV remains open. An ECAM
warning will start.

PACK SENSORS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) pressure sensor is mounted on the
bulkhead between the air conditioning bay and the pressurized cabin. It
is connected to the corresponding ACSC.
PACK INLET PRESSURE SENSOR The pack inlet pressure sensor signals a pack
inlet pressure drop to the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC). It
is used to determine the appropriate BYPass valve position. When the
pack inlet pressure is low, the BYP valve is controlled to a more open
position in order to decrease the Differential Pressure (DELTA P) of the
air conditioning pack. At the same time, the ram air inlet flap is
controlled to a more open position to compensate for the decreased
efficiency of the turbine/compressor cycle. Also, when engines are idle,
if the cooling demand cannot be satisfied, the engine idle setting can
be changed by a thrust demand.
WATER EXTRACT TEMPERATURE SENSOR
DELTA P SENSOR
The pack discharge temperature sensor signals the pack outlet
temperature to the ACSC for ECAM display. The pack outlet temperature
sensor also gives pack overheat warning indications if the pack outlet
temperature exceeds 88°C (190°F).
A DELTA P sensor measures a differential pressure at the Flow Control
Valve (FCV) inlet. This DELTA P, which is equivalent to the airflow, is
converted into an electrical signal and sent to the ACSC. It is used for
ECAM display and FCV control.
The water extract temperature sensor signals the water extractor
temperature for the pack outlet temperature control. The pack
temperature sensor has two thermistors: one sensing element is connected
to lane 1 and the other to lane 2 of the related ACSC. They are used to
modulate the pack outlet temperature.
PACK DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR
COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR The compressor discharge
temperature sensor signals the compressor outlet temperature to the ACSC
for pack temperature control and overheat detection. Pack temperature
control: - up to 180°C (385°F): normal operation, - 180°C to 220°C
(428°F): the ram air inlet flap opens more in order to increase the RAM
airflow. The pack FAULT light comes on in if there is pack overheat of
260°C (500°F). If the A/C is on ground, automatic FCV closure occurs.
PACK DISCHARGE PRESSURE SENSOR The pack discharge pressure sensor
measures the pressure difference between turbine outlet and cabin
underfloor pressure. The pack discharge

COCKPIT &amp; CABIN COMPONENTS D/O (3) MIXER UNIT The mixer unit mixes air
from packs and recirculated air from the cabin before distribution to
each zone. The mixer unit, installed under the cabin floor, uses cabin
air, which has entered the underfloor area and has been drawn through
recirculation filters by recirculation fans. This air is mixed with
conditioned air from the packs. The quantity of cabin air mixed with
conditioned air varies from 37% to 51% (the cabin fans operate at a
constant speed, but the airflow from the Pack Flow Control Valve (FCV)
can vary.)
TEMPERATURE SENSORS There are two mixer unit temperature sensors, one on
either side of the mixer unit. They give the actual temperature of the
mixer unit to the Air Conditioning System Controllers (ASCSs). The
cockpit mixer unit temperature sensor is connected to the ACSC 1 and the
cabin mixer unit to the ACSC 2. Each mixer unit temperature sensor has
two thermistors, one connected to lane 1 and the other to the second
lane of the ACSC.
MIXER UNIT FLAP The mixer unit flap ensures sufficient flight deck air
supply if pack 1 is selected off. An electrically operated mixer unit
flap is installed to ensure that sufficient fresh air is delivered to
the cockpit in case of pack 1 failure.

COCKPIT &amp; CABIN COMPONENTS D/O (3) AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CONTROLLERS
During normal or abnormal operation the cockpit and cabin system is
controlled by the two ACSCs. Cabin zones demanding a higher temperature
than that which is available from the mixer unit receive additional hot
trim-air added by the trim air valve. The trim air valves are operated
by ACSC 1 for the cockpit and ACSC 2 for the FWD and aft cabin zones.
TRIM AIR PRV The trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) is
pneumatically operated and electrically controlled by a solenoid. The
solenoid controls the ON/OFF function. The trim air PRV regulates the
pressure of the air supplied to the trim air valves, 4 psi above the
cabin pressure. The ON/OFF function solenoid de-energizes when the HOT
AIR P/B is set to OFF or when the temperature of any duct is above 88°C
(190°F). This closes the valve.
HOT AIR PRESSURE SWITCH Due to a malfunction of the trim air PRV, the
hot air pressure switch signals overpressure to ACSCs 1 and 2 for ECAM
display and the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) and monitoring.
If pressure in the system is 6.5 psi greater than the cabin pressure,
ACSC 1 sends a fault signal to ECAM. This signal stays until the
pressure falls below 5 psi.
TRIM AIR VALVES The trim air valves lets the zone temperature be
adjusted by modulating the hot airflow added to air from the mixer unit.
The trim air valves close when the trim air PRV closes. The butterfly of
the trim air valves is controlled by a stepper motor. The trim air valve
position is determined using the step-counting principle.

ZONE TEMPERATURE CONTROL INTERFACES (3) GENERAL
ECB
The function of the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) is to
communicate with other systems via hardware interfaces.
The ACSC sends data to the Electronic Control Box (ECB) and receives an
APU bleed valve open discrete. The ACSC sends to the ECB the increase of
APU flow used for increased bleed airflow. When the ECB sends a signal
to the ACSC, the APU bleed valve open discrete is used for flow demand
calculation.
SDAC System data information is transmitted to the System Data
Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC) via ARINC buses for system monitoring.
The system data information is used for warning and display. These data
are temperature, valve position and others.
EIU The ACSC sends data to both Engine Interface Units (EIUs). Each EIU
sends one discrete to the ACSC. EIUs 1 and 2 send to the ACSC: - the
take-off thrust used for pack ram air inlet closure, - the High Pressure
(HP) fuel valve position used for bleed demand circulation and for
engine start sequence, so that the pack Flow Control Valves (FCVs) are
controlled to close during engine start. The ACSC sends to EIUs 1 and
2: - the engine power increase used for bleed airflow increase, - the
bleed and the anti-ice status used for thrust limit calculation.
CPC The Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC) 1 or 2 (depending who is in
control) sends data to the ACSC for zone and pack temperature control.
The A/C altitude is used for zone temperature compensation and pack
water extractor outlet temperature limitation.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
FDIMU The ACSCs send system main status data to the Flight Data
Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) for maintenance monitoring
functions. The ACSC sends to the FDIMU: - the trim-air Pressure
Regulating Valve (PRV) position, - pack flow, water extractor and pack
compressor discharge temperatures, BYPass valve and ram air inlet flap
positions.
CFDIU ACSC 2 sends BITE data to the Centralized Fault Display Interface
Unit (CFDIU) for system monitoring. The BITE data is used for
temperature control system monitoring. Only the ASCS 2 is connected to
the CFDIU. Therefore all BITE data from/to ACSC 1 are transmitted
through the ACSC 2.
AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CONTROLLERS The ACSCs mainly receive temperature
and flow demands, CFDIU control signals and send back maintenance data
signals. The ACSCs also receive a signal from the DITCHING P/B to close
both pack FCVs if there is a ditching. ACSC 1 and 2 receive a signal
from the engine FIRE P/B, to close the related pack FCV in case of
engine fire. The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) Director 1
sends a data signal for ACSC 1, and the CIDS Director 2 sends a signal
for ACSC 2 for

temperature regulation (+ or - 2.5°C) from the Flight Attendant Panel
(FAP).
FAN PARAMETERS The ACSCs receive discrete signals from recirculation and
toilet fans for monitoring. The lavatory and galley extraction and the
cabin recirculation fan operation are used for monitoring and
transmission to the SDACs and CFDIU.
ANTI-ICE AND PNEUMATIC PARAMETERS Anti-ice and pneumatic parameters are
used to detect faults and to make sure that the status of the bleed air
system is transmitted to the CFDIU and EIUs. The valve positions, low
and high pressure, are used for anti-ice system fault detection for the
CFDIU and thrust limit calculation for the EIUs.
LGCIU 2 Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 2 sends a
ground/flight signal to both ACSCs for pack air inlet flap operation.
The ground/flight signal is used for pack ram air inlet flap closure
during take-off and landing phases.
BSCU The Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU) sends a wheel signal to
both ACSCs for pack ram air inlet flap operation. The wheel speed is
used for pack ram air inlet flap closure during take-off and landing
phases.

EMERGENCY RAM AIR INLET D/O (3) GENERAL The A/C has one emergency ram
air inlet flap located at the lower LH side of the fuselage, sharing the
same duct with the LP ground connection.
EMERGENCY RAM AIR INLET FLAP OPERATION In case of failure of both packs
in flight or a smoke removal in flight, an emergency ram air inlet flap
can be opened for A/C ventilation. In case of smoke removal or loss of
both packs, the RAM AIR P/B must be set to ON. When set to ON, and if
DITCHING is not selected, the emergency ram air inlet flap opens. The
flap, installed between the LP GND connection and ram air inlet, closes
one side of the Y-duct when air is supplied from the other side. The
check valve stays closed. The A/C must descend to less than 10000 ft.
When the cabin differential pressure is less than 1 psi, the Cabin
Pressure Controller in control half opens the outflow valve. The air
then goes through the check valve to the mixing unit.

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (3) CABIN PRESSURE CONTROLLERS There are two
interchangeable controllers, which are identified as Cabin Pressure
Controller (CPC) 1 and CPC 2 by means of pin programming. Each
controller has an automatic and manual part which are functionally and
electronically independent of each other. One controller operates the
system at a time according to flight profile data and A/C
configurations. The second controller is in active stand-by with
automatic changeover after each flight or in case of failure of the
active one. The CPCs inputs are: - flight profile data: Flight
Management and Guidance System (FMGS), Air Data/Inertial Reference
System (ADIRS), Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS), - A/C
configurations: Engine Interface Unit (EIU), Landing Gear Control and
Interface Unit (LGCIU), Environmental Control System (ECS). The CPCs
outputs data for indicating and monitoring are: Flight Warning Computer
(FWC), System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC), CFDS, ECS, Aircraft
Integrated Data System (AIDS). When manual mode is used, the manual part
of controller 1 operates only as a back-up indication circuit processing
outputs for indicating and monitoring. CPC 1 manual part outputs for
monitoring and indicating are: FWC and SDAC. CPC 2 manual part is not
used.
OUTFLOW VALVE In automatic mode, the outflow valve is controlled by the
operating controller. The outflow valve is of the double flap and motor
driven type. In automatic operation, the outflow valve is operated by
electronics module 1 or module 2 depending on the operating
controller: - electronics module 1 is controlled by controller 1,
controller 1 plus motor 1 are linked to system 1, - electronics module 2
is controlled by controller 2, controller 2 plus motor 2 are linked to
system 2.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
Two electronic actuators interface with the controllers. A pressure
switch, which only operates in automatic mode, is installed in each
electronic actuator. It closes the applicable outflow valve in case of
cabin altitude above 15000 ft. Motor 3 is controlled from the CABIN
PRESSure panel by the MANual Vertical/Speed ConTroL toggle switch when
manual mode is selected on the MODE SELection P/B. The manual motor is
used in case of failure of systems 1 and 2. The outflow valve position
monitoring is based on a triple potentiometer principle. Potentiometer
1(2) generates a feedback signal, sent to CPC 1(2) through electronic
actuator 1(2). It is used for indication and initialization functions in
automatic operation. Potentiometer 3 generates a feedback signal, sent
straight to the CPC 1 manual backup part. It is used as indication
function in manual operation only.
SAFETY VALVES The safety valves prevent excessive positive and negative
differential pressure (DELTA P) in the fuselage. They are installed on
the aft pressure bulkhead above the A/C flotation line. The safety
valves are poppet-type pneumatic valves. They operate independently.
RPCU The RPCU interfaces with the CPCs and takes over the control of the
outflow valves automatically if the outflow valve is not in the fully
open position when the aircraft is on ground. This is to prevent any
door violent opening in case of residual cabin pressure. The control of
the Outflow Valve (OFV) by the Residual Pressure Control System (RPCU)
is done through the MOT 3, when the following situation is detected: -
both main landing gears are compressed, or one main landing gear is
compressed and the Parking Brake is set to ON, and - both Master
Switches are in OFF or speed is below 100 knots AND

and the barometric correction signals to both controllers for pressure
control. These signals are: - Static pressure, - BARO (barometric)
correction, - ADIRU validity, used for all sequences and priority
selection. ADIRU 1, 2, 3 sends signals to controller 1 and ADIRU 2, 1, 3
sends signals to controller 2.

for the LH / RH main landing gear compressed condition - Air Data
Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) send aircraft speed below or above 100
knots, - Parking Brake Control Relay sends the signal Parking Brake set
to ON or OFF These inputs determine the A/C condition at gate and are
used to satisfy RPCU control logics The Residual Pressure Control Unit
(RPCU) has other interfaces: - MODE SEL P/B on the CABIN PRESS panel
25VU detects if the cabin pressure control system is in manual mode -
Cabin Pressure Controller 1 (CPC) signals if the CPC 1 is operative or
inoperative - Outflow Valve (OFV) position of the potentiometer 3 (sent
to the MANual part of CPC 1) detects if the OFV is 100% open or not -
Cabin Pressure Controller 2 (CPC) signals if the CPC 2 is operative or
inoperative These inputs determine if the RPCU needs to control the OFV
to the fully open position. Therefore the RPCU sends a direct signal to
MOTOR 3 to open the OFV. The RPCU sends a discrete signal to the CFDIU
for fault information (ok or not ok), which leads to a class 3 fault
indication.

SYSTEM CONTROL INTERFACES (3) CABIN ALTITUDE INDICATION AUTO MODE The
calculation of the cabin altitude in the AUTO mode is done differently
in relation to the aircraft altitude: - If the aircraft altitude is
higher than 5000 ft above take-off or landing fields, the cabin altitude
is calculated to the standard atmosphere. - If the aircraft altitude is
lower than 5000 ft above take-off or landing fields, the cabin altitude
is calculated to the true altitude above sea level with the barometric
correction from the Air Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRS).
MANUAL MODE The calculation of the cabin altitude in the MANual mode is
done in the Display Management Computer (DMC) to standard atmosphere.
The Cabin Pressure Control System (CPCS) manual backup circuit supplies
a cabin pressure value to the SDAC. Thus, there can be a small
difference in the cabin altitude values between the AUTO and MAN modes
if the aircraft altitude is higher than 5000 ft above take-off or
landing fields. There can be a difference between the cabin altitude
values due to the barometric conditions (weather) if the aircraft
altitude is lower than 5000 ft above take-off or landing fields.
The active CPC uses the auto-motor to control the outflow valve to the
requested position. It also supplies data for indication on the
Electronic Instrumentation System (EIS). Only one CPC operates the
system at a time, while the other system is in hot standby. The change
of control from one CPC to the other is fully automatic after each
flight, on landing. The CPCs will also change in flight if there is a
failure of one of the control systems.
MANUAL OPERATION The MAN V/S toggle switch controls the manual motor of
the outflow valve when the MAN SEL switch is selected to MAN. These
controls are installed in the cockpit, on the CABIN PRESS overhead
panel. In manual mode, the backup channel of the CPC in position no. 1
is used. It has a pressure sensor to start the excess cabin altitude
warning and pressure outputs for the indication on the EIS. If the MAN
Part of CPC1 is active, the data for indication on EIS come from the
ADIRUs and the SDAC.
PRESSURIZATION CONTROL SYSTEM AUTOMATIC OPERATION The system has two
identical, independent, automatic systems. Each system has a CPC, which
controls the pressure through a flap-type outflow valve. In the
automatic operation, the CPCs use the data from the Flight Management
and Guidance System (FMGS) and the ADIRS.

CABIN PRESS PANEL/SDAC
In case of excessive cabin altitude, the active controller sends a
discrete signal to both Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) for level 3
warnings. This warning is generated if cabin altitude exceeds 9550ft.
A manual mode selection signal is sent from the pressure panel to both
SDACs. The MANual MODE SEL signal is used for ECAM display.
NOTE: Note: Each manual part is a separate, electrically supplied part.
SDAC
SAFETY VALVES/SDAC The safety valve position signals are sent to both
SDAC. The safety valve position signal is used for ECAM display.
Both controllers send ARINC and discrete signals to the System Data
Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC). When the system is in automatic mode,
ARINC and discrete signals are used for monitoring and warning
indications. In manual mode, 3 analog signals are provided from the
manual part of CPC1 only.
CFDIU Both controllers send BITE data to the Centralized Fault Display
Interface Unit (CFDIU) via ARINC buses. This data is sent continuously
or on request. The signal is a BITE data, used for Centralized Fault
Display System (CFDS) monitoring.
CIDS In case of excessive cabin altitude, the pressure controllers send
a discrete signal to the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS).
The cabin altitude exceeding 11300 ft signal is used for passenger
signs.
CABIN PRESS PANEL In case of failure of both automatic systems, the
controllers send a discrete signal to the pressure panel for FAULT light
illumination.

SYSTEM DESIGN PRESENTATION (2) AVIONICS The avionics ventilation system
ensures a proper ventilation of the electrical equipment. Air is taken
from different sources depending on the A/C configuration and ambient
conditions. Ventilation air is blown to the equipment by a blower fan
and extracted by an extraction fan. The cockpit temperature sensor for
the temperature control system is connected to the extraction part of
the avionics ventilation.
LAVatories and galleys The lavatory (LAV) and galleys (GALY) ventilation
system is used to remove unpleasant odors before they enter the cabin.
Ventilation air is supplied from cabin distribution ducts and discharged
overboard via the outflow valve by an extraction fan. The FWD and AFT
cabin zones temperature sensors are connected to the lavatory and galley
extraction system.
CARGO The FWD and aft cargo compartments are ventilated by cabin ambient
air coming from the cabin zones through openings in the cabin floor
behind the sidewall panels. The FWD cargo compartment is ventilated by
means of an extraction fan or by differential pressure. The aft cargo
compartment is ventilated by means of an extraction fan only. NOTE:
Note: The ventilation system is optional and independent for each
compartment.
CONTrollers The Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) ensures
control and monitoring of the AVNCS ventilation system. The cargo
ventilation controller (CONT) controls and monitors the isolation valves
and the extraction fan of the cargo ventilation system.

the OPEN position. These affected components are: - the blower fan, -
the extract fan, - the ventilation filter.

FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY
AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS When the
aircraft is on the ground with the electrical systems powered, the
avionics ventilation system is normally in the OPEN configuration. In
this configuration, the ventilation BLOWER fan pulls air in from the
open Skin Air Inlet Valve on the LH side of the fuselage. The air is
circulated through the ventilation system and then the EXTRACTION fan
discharges the air overboard through the open Skin Air Outlet Valve. If
maintenance is being performed on the aircraft in heavy rain conditions
with the ventilation system in the OPEN configuration, the blower fan
may draw water into the ventilation system and subsequently, into the
aircraft computers. To prevent water ingestion, the ventilation system
should be put in the CLOSED configuration by selecting the EXTRACT
pushbutton to OverRriDe (OVRD) on the VENTILATION panel. For additional
cooling in the CLOSED configuration, select the packs ON. If the Skin
Air INLET or OUTLET valve fails on the ground and no replacement part is
available, either valve may be manually operated to the OPEN position.
This will allow cooling for the avionics equipment if the aircraft is
powered for maintenance operations. Before flight, the failed valve must
be deactivated in the proper configuration.
