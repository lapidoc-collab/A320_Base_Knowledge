FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The engine
and APU fire protection is done by two sub-systems: the FIRE detection
system and the FIRE extinguishing system.
ENGINE AND APU FIRE DETECTION The engines and the APU have individual
fire detection systems. Each system has two identical detection loops (A
and B) installed in parallel. Each loop includes 3 detector elements.
The two loops are monitored by a Fire Detection Unit (FDU). FDU 1
monitors the loops on engine 1 and FDU 2 monitors the loops on engine 2.
The FDU sends FIRE and FAULT signals to the Flight Warning Computer
(FWC) for display on ECAM.
ENGINE AND APU FIRE EXTINGUISHING The guarded FIRE P/B switches give
FIRE indication and are used to isolate the related systems. When the
FIRE pushbutton is released out, the engine or APU will shut down. This
also arms the extinguishing system. Each engine has 2 fire bottles
installed in the pylon. The discharge of each bottle is controlled by a
related AGENT P/BSW. The P/B switches are on the FIRE panel on the
overhead panel. For the APU, there is only one fire extinguisher bottle,
which is installed in the aft fuselage forward of the APU firewall. Its
discharge is controlled by one AGENT P/BSW. On the ground, an APU FIRE
will cause an automatic shutdown of the APU and an automatic discharge
of the bottle. The TEST buttons are used to do tests on the different
fire detection and extinguishing systems and make sure they operate
correctly.

(continued) AVIONICS SMOKE DETECTION The A320 family aircraft have a
cooling system for the avionics equipment. The cooling system is
controlled and monitored by the Avionics Equipment Ventilation
Controller (AEVC). The circulation of the air through the system is
supplied by a blower fan (cool air supply) and an extraction fan (warm
air removal). The extraction airflow is downstream of the avionics
equipment. The avionics SMOKE detector, which is installed in the
extraction duct, is used for the detection of smoke from the computers
and control boxes. The detector is monitored by the AEVC. The smoke
detector directly sends the signal to FWC for the AVIONICS SMOKE warning
in the cockpit.

(continued) CARGO SMOKE DETECTION The cargo compartment smoke detection
system is monitored by the Smoke Detection Function (SDF) integrated in
the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS). The CIDS-SDF receives
signals from the cargo detectors and sends SMOKE or FAULT warnings to
the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) to give an alert to the flight crew.
CARGO FIRE EXTINGUISHING The cargo compartment fire-extinguishing agent
is discharged into the FWD compartment through one nozzle (2 nozzles for
A321) or into the AFT compartment through two nozzles (3 nozzles for
A321). The standard system includes one extinguishing bottle in the FWD
cargo compartment (or in the AFT bulk cargo compartment, RH side, for
A318 and A319). For the A320, the extinguishing bottle can also be in
the AFT cargo compartment. An optional system includes two bottles. The
second bottle can be used for large range operations.

(continued) LAVATORY SMOKE DETECTION AND EXTINGUISHING The lavatory
smoke detection system is monitored by the SDF integrated in the CIDS.
The CIDS-SDF receives signals from the lavatory detectors and sends
SMOKE or FAULT warnings to the FWC to give an alert to the flight crew.
The protection of each lavatory waste bin is done by an automatic fire
extinguishing system. A small pressurized extinguisher will
automatically discharge if there is a fire. The fusible material in the
discharge tube melts at high temperature and the pressurized agent is
discharged into the waste bin. LAV SMOKE warnings are also sent to the
CIDS to give an alert to the cabin crew.

ENGINE FIRE DETECTION LOGIC (3) FIRE DETECTORS STATE In NORMAL STATE,
the INTEGRITY switch is closed and the ALARM switch is open. In ALARM
STATE: The effect of an average temperature expands the helium (inert)
gas, which in turn closes the ALARM switch, or the effect of heat caused
by a flame or hot gas, releases core (active) gas from the hybrid core,
which in turn closes the ALARM switch. In both cases, the detector sends
a fire signal. In FAULT STATE: In the event of gas pressure loss (pipe
fracture or cut off due to a torching flame), the INTEGRITY switch opens
and generates a fault signal.

ENGINE FIRE PUSHBUTTON INTERFACES (3) GENERAL During the engine fire
procedure, the ENGINE FIRE P/BSW is manually released out. This triggers
several automatic sequences simplifying further crew actions and system
monitoring.
MONITORING INTERFACES Releasing the fire P/BSW out cancels the
Continuous Repetitive Chime (CRC), signals the action to the Flight
Warning Computer (FWC) for further management of other warnings and
messages and the SQUIB light comes on, on the engine fire control panel.
SUPPLY INTERFACES Quick isolation of all systems on the related engine,
which could be the origin of the fire or feed the fire, is achieved as
soon as the fire P/BSW is released out. These systems are: - fuel, -

cartridge.
FIRE BOTTLE WARNING: The fire bottle cartridges are explosive. Remove
them before working on the bottle. Protective caps must be installed
during bottle removal/installation to prevent damage to discharge
diaphragm, which could result in injury to personnel.
DISCHARGE CARTRIDGE WARNING: Before power is supplied to the A/C make
sure that electrical circuits upon which work is in progress are
isolated. Cartridges are class "C" explosives and must be handled or
stored by authorized personnel or disposed of by an approved method.
When cartridge electrical connectors are disconnected, the cartridge
electrical pins must be shunted with a protective shunt, which is given
by the manufacturer. A shunt plug or shorting clip will prevent bottle
discharge which could cause injury to maintenance personnel. The
cartridge installed must be supplied by fire bottle vendor and agreed
with the specification indicated in the AMM.

APU FIRE DETECTION LOGIC (3) LOOP FAULT WARNING In case of a loop
failure the FDU supplies a loop fault warning signal to the ECAM and
Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). The FDU supplies an
inoperative signal if any of the following conditions are met: -
electrical failure, - integrity failure, - detection of a single loop
fire during more than 16 s while the other loop is in normal condition.
ELECTRICAL FAILURE An electrical failure is signaled by a loop fault
message if there is a loss of electrical power of the APU fire detection
system.
INTEGRITY FAILURE An integrity failure is signaled by a loop fault
message if there is a loss of pressure in a fire sensor element.

APU FIRE PUSHBUTTON INTERFACES (3) GENERAL During the APU fire
procedure, the APU FIRE PUSHbutton switch is manually released out. This
triggers several automatic sequences simplifying further crew actions
and system monitoring.
MONITORING INTERFACES Releasing the FIRE P/BSW out cancels the
Continuous Repetitive Chime (CRC), signals the action to the Flight
Warning Computer (FWC), for further management of other warnings and
messages and the SQUIB light comes on, on the APU fire control panel.
SUPPLY INTERFACES Quick isolation of all systems on the APU, which could
be the origin of the fire or feed the fire, is achieved as soon as the
FIRE P/BSW is released out. These systems are: - fuel, - air, - electric
power. The Electronic Control Box (ECB) of the APU is triggered to
initiate an emergency APU shutdown.
AUTO EXTINGUISHING ON GROUND When an APU fire is detected on ground, the
APU shuts down automatically and the fire extinguishing system is
automatically triggered.

PRECAUTIONS (3) GENERAL Specific precautions must be taken during
removal or installation of a fire extinguishing bottle and a discharge
cartridge.
FIRE BOTTLE WARNING: The fire bottle cartridges are explosive. Remove
them before working on the bottle. Protective caps must be installed
during bottle removal/installation to prevent damage to discharge
diaphragm, which could result in injury to personnel.
DISCHARGE CARTRIDGE WARNING: Before power is supplied to the A/C make
sure that electrical circuits upon which work is in progress are
isolated. Cartridges are class "C" explosives and must be handled or
stored by authorized personnel or disposed of by an approved method.
When cartridge electrical connectors are disconnected, the cartridge
electrical pins must be shunted with a protective shunt, which is given
by the manufacturer. A shunt plug or shorting clip will prevent bottle
discharge, which could cause injury to maintenance personnel. The
cartridge installed must be of the same make as the fire bottle and
agreed with the specification indicated in the AMM.

CARGO FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) CIDS SMOKE DETECTION
FUNCTION
BOTTLE
For each compartment, the Smoke Detection Function (SDF) integrated in
each CIDS director triggers cabin and cockpit warnings. The directors
interface with the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), the
ventilation system, and the cargo fire extinguishing bottle condition
monitoring system. A SMOKE warning is generated when both detectors in a
cavity detect smoke ('AND' logic). The CIDS-SDF also monitors the smoke
detectors in case of a single detection. When only one cargo smoke
detector detects smoke, the CIDS-SDF checks the second detector
automatically: - if this test shows a normal operation of the second
detector, the first detector is declared faulty. The result is no smoke
warning in the cockpit, - if this test shows an abnormal operation of
the second detector, the smoke warnings are activated. The second
detector is declared faulty.
On A320 and A321, one extinguisher bottle is installed in the FWD cargo
compartment, on A318 and A319 the bottle is installed in the Bulk cargo
compartment. Optionally, on the A320, the extinguisher bottle can be
installed in the AFT cargo compartment. The bottle supplies fire
extinguishing for the FWD and for the AFT/BULK cargo compartments. The
bottle has a pressure switch to monitor agent pressure and two
electrically firing cartridges or squibs for agent discharges. The
bottle pressure and the two squibs circuit conditions are continuously
monitored by the CIDS-SDF. In case of bottle pressure drop or loss of
electrical squib continuity, the CIDS-SDF sends signals to the ECAM and
CFDS.
WARNINGS The CIDS-SDF sends signals for cockpit local warnings, ECAM
system and cargo ventilation controller. It also supplies the fault
messages to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). In case of FWD
or AFT/BULK smoke detection; the respective SMOKE light comes on, on the
CARGO SMOKE panel. At the same time the cargo ventilation controller
closes the isolation valves of the affected compartment (If ventilation
installed). In case of a smoke detector failure, the CIDS-SDF sends
signals to the ECAM and CFDS systems.
DISCH PUSHBUTTON Action on one of the FWD or AFT guarded DISCHarge P/Bs
discharges the bottle in the respective cargo compartment. When smoke is
detected, the FWD or AFT DISCH P/BSW has to be pressed, in order to fire
the related squib of the extinguishing bottle. Both DISCH lights come on
when the fire extinguishing bottle is discharged.

TEST PUSHBUTTON When the TEST P/B is pressed and held, the CIDS-SDF
carries out an automatic test. Smoke and a bottle pressure drop
conditions are simulated. The smoke detectors are tested. When the TEST
P/B is pressed and held, the SMOKE and DISCH lights on the CARGO SMOKE
panel come on twice, and the ECAM warnings are activated. The isolation
valves of the cargo compartment ventilation system close and the
extraction fan stops. The CIDS also passes the test and in case of a
failure of one CIDS-SDF channel the lamps come on only once. When the
TEST P/B is released, the DISCH lights and the SMOKE lights go off. The
isolation valves of the cargo compartment ventilation system open and
the extraction fan starts. The information is stored in the CFDS. On
aircraft fitted with CIDS Smoke Detection functions (post mod 33100),
spurious smoke warnings can be caused in particular circumstances, which
can lead to IFTB or diversion. This software is now included in new CIDS
OBRM (P/N Z064H000034D) introduced via: - SB A320-23-1766 for CEO A320

CARGO &amp; LAVATORY SMOKE DETECTION SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The cargo and
lavatory smoke detectors are connected to both Smoke Detection Functions
(SDFs) integrated in the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS)
directors via Controller Area Network (CAN) busses.
LAVATORY SMOKE The lavatory smoke detectors are connected to type B
Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs) via CAN buses and the DEUs B are linked to
the CIDS directors via the CIDS middle line bus. The lavatory smoke
detection is done by the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the CIDS-SDF.
When smoke is detected in a lavatory, the CPU 1 or 2 sends the following
cabin warnings: - a triple chime is broadcast in all cabin or attendant
station loudspeakers, - a flashing amber light on the related Area Call
Panel (ACP), - "SMOKE LAV X" message is displayed and a red indicator
flashes on all the Attendant Indication Panels (AIPs), - SMOKE DETECTION
page appears automatically on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) on which
"SMOKE DETECTED" red message is displayed and a red icon is displayed at
the affected location, - the affected amber lavatory call light flashes.
Simultaneously, the SDF 1 or 2 sends a smoke alert to the Flight Warning
Computers (FWCs), which generates the following cockpit warnings: - a
Continuous Repetitive Chime (CRC), - the red MASTER WARNing light, - the
LAVATORY SMOKE warning message on the EWD. If smoke is no longer
detected, the directors automatically reset all visual and aural
indications. NOTE: An option disables lavatory warnings in the cockpit.

PRECAUTIONS (3) GENERAL Specific precautions must be taken during
removal or installation of a fire extinguishing bottle and a discharge
cartridge.
FIRE BOTTLE WARNING: The fire bottle cartridges are explosive. Remove
them before working on the bottle. Protective caps must be installed
during bottle removal/installation to prevent damage to discharge
diaphragm, which could result in injury to personnel.
DISCHARGE CARTRIDGE WARNING: Before power is supplied to the A/C, make
sure that electrical circuits upon which work is in progress are
isolated. Cartridges are class "C" explosives and must be handled or
stored by authorized personnel or disposed of by an approved method.
When cartridge electrical connectors are disconnected, the cartridge
electrical pins must be shunted with a protective shunt which is given
by the manufacturer. A shunt plug or shorting clip will prevent bottle
discharge which could cause injury to maintenance personnel. The
cartridge installed must be supplied by fire bottle vendor and agreed
with the specification indicated in the AMM.

CONTROL PANEL AND FLOW METERING SYSTEM This optional panel 22VU has an
additional feature to control the discharge on the second cargo fire
bottle, by cockpit crew manual, also called dual shot system. The ETOPS
panel 22VU controls each of the squib on the two bottles. A priority
relay prevents the bottle 2 to be discharged before bottle 1. The TEST
pushbutton switch on the overhead panel 22VU, activates the Smoke
Detection Function within the Director (CIDS-SDF), starting an automatic
test. Smoke and bottle pressure drop conditions are simulated.
Indications appear on the cargo smoke panel 22VU as follows: - the FWD
and AFT smoke indication lights come on, - the FWD and AFT discharge
indication lights come on. The smoke detection function in the
CIDS-Director (CIDS-SDF) continuously monitors the bottle pressure
condition, the cartridges and the wiring. If faults occur, they show on
the ECAM upper display unit. The faults are also transmitted to the
Centralized Fault Display (CFDS). The second bottle equally supplies the
FWD and AFT cargo compartment discharge nozzles through an ETOPS flow
metering system. This ETOPS flow metering system is made of: - a water
absorbing filter, - a solid particle filter, - a pressure reducer, - a
diaphragm (for flow metering) and non-return valve. The ETOPS flow
metering system makes sure that there is a sufficient concentration in
the cargo compartment during ETOPS flight diversion. NOTE: the second
bottle on ETOPS A/C will be discharged through a flow metering system 60
min. after the first bottle.

FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) DAILY CHECKS Each lavatory
waste bin is protected from fire by an automatically discharged fire
bottle. The bottle is located above the waste bin. The lavatory fire
bottle pressure may be checked at the pressure gage on the bottle. The
APU fire bottle is located forward of the APU firewall. Prior to
starting the APU, the bottle pressure may be insured by checking the red
disc located on the rear fuselage lower left side. The red disc is
connected to an overpressure discharge tube. If the bottle pressure
becomes excessive, the bottle will discharge to protect the structure
and the red disc will blow out. The cargo compartments should be checked
for integrity. Any damage to the cargo compartment ceiling or sidewall
liner should be repaired immediately. If the compartment is ventilated,
the ventilation isolation valves are automatically closed when SMOKE is
detected. A hole in the liner could induce airflow through the
compartment, compromising the fire protection of the compartments. If
the compartment is not ventilated, no airflow is permitted.

be indicated by a STATUS message on ECAM. The aircraft may be dispatched
in this condition per the MEL. If both detectors in one cavity are
faulty, the aircraft may be dispatched with the compartment empty. The
aircraft may be dispatched with the use of the compartments as long as
the compartment does not contain inflammable or combustible materials.
If the aircraft is equipped with cargo compartment ventilation, the
isolation valves must be selected closed. Before each flight, the
compartment liner must be checked for condition and integrity. Each
lavatory has a single detector. If this detector fails, the aircraft may
be dispatched with the lavatory locked closed and the waste bin empty.
The lavatory may be used as long as the extinguisher pressure is

FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS The APU
auto extinguishing test should be performed every 3000 flight hours.
This test will insure that the APU will be protected in case of a fire.
When a fire is detected the APU will shut down and the fire bottle will
be discharged automatically. The Auto extinguishing test pushbutton is
found on the overhead MAINT panel. The test must be done with the APU
shut down but with the master switch selected ON. During the test the
APU auto shutdown is simulated and the APU fuel supply valve is closed.
Both squibs of each engine fire bottle No. 1 and one squib of the APU
fire bottle are supplied by 28 VDC from the HOT bus. When performing
maintenance with the FIRE pushbutton released out, make sure to pull
both squib C/Bs to protect against bottle discharge. If the C/Bs are not
pulled, the bottle may be discharged even without power on the aircraft.
