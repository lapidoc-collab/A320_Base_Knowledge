AC 1 and AC 2 buses are supplied in priority by their own side
generator, There are two identical engine driven generators called
Integrated Drive then the external power, then the APU generator and
then by the opposite Generators (IDGs). They are used as the main power
source to supply generator.
the A/C electrical network.
The IDG basically contains, in a common housing, a generator and a
Constant Speed Drive (CSD). The CSD gives a constant input speed to the
generator, which is required for a constant output frequency.
Each generator supplies 115V 400Hz AC to its own bus:
\- generator 1 supplies AC bus 1,
\- generator 2 supplies AC bus 2.
This supply is known as split operation, which means that the AC power
sources are never connected in parallel.
Each AC bus supplies a Transformer Rectifier (TR):
\- AC bus 1 supplies TR 1,
\- AC bus 2 supplies TR 2.
The TRs convert 115V AC into 28V DC to supply their associated DC
buses, DC 1 and DC 2.
DC bus 1 then supplies the DC BAT bus.
The DC battery bus can charge the batteries or receive power from the
batteries as a backup supply, if no other power sources are available.
The electrical system also includes two ESSential (ESS) Buses. One is
the AC ESS bus fed by AC bus 1 and the other is the DC ESS bus fed by DC
bus 1. These buses are used to supply the most critical A/C
systems.
This is the basic electrical system. We will now introduce some other
components, which also supply the system.
The entire electrical network can also be supplied by the APU generator.
On the ground, the aircraft electrical network can be supplied by an
external power source.
Any one of the power sources can supply the entire electrical network.
As no parallel connection is allowed on this A/C (split operation), we

**EMERGENCY CONFIGURATION**
In the event of emergency operation, the Emergency Generator (EMER
GEN) supplies the A/C with electrical power. The EMER GEN needs
hydraulic power to operate. This hydraulic power to drive the EMER
GEN is supplied by the Blue Hydraulic system via the Ram Air Turbine
(RAT).
Then, the EMER GEN supplies the DC ESS BUS directly through the ESS TR.
In emergency configuration (loss of AC BUS 1 and AC
BUS 2) the EMER GEN supplies the ESS TR and the AC ESS BUS.

The ECAM Electric System page shows all relevant data with regard to the
entire A/C Electrical Power Generation and Distribution systems. The
System page shown here is a normal configuration with main generators
supplying the network.
The battery voltage can be monitored either on the overhead panel or the
ECAM page. Each battery is controlled by a pushbutton switch (P/BSW).
Their related P/BSW control both main generators and the APU
generator.
A P/BSW also controls the external power.
The AC ESS FEED P/BSW lets the pilots change the supply to the AC ESS
bus from AC bus 1 to AC bus 2.
When the BUS TIE P/BSW is in the AUTO position, it lets the opening or
closing of the bus tie contactors (not shown on the ECAM page) in order
to supply the AC 1 and AC 2 buses according to the power supply
priorities.
When OFF, both bus tie contactors open to isolate one side of the
network from the other.
In case of failure, the IDG P/BSWitches disconnect the IDG from the
engine gearbox.
The GALY & CAB P/BSW lets galleys and some sub-buses be manually shed.
The COMMERCIAL P/BSW is used for the shedding of all commercial loads

The EMER GEN TEST P/B is used on ground to test the EMERgency GENerator
or the Static Inverter.
In avionics smoke condition, the GEN 1 LINE P/B disconnects the
generator 1 from the bus-bar but the generator remains excited to supply
some fuel pumps.
When AC BUS 1 and 2 are no longer supplied, the RAT will extend
automatically to pressurize the blue hydraulic system, which powers the
EMER GEN, if the A/C speed is sufficient.
Manual activation is also possible in case of automatic activation
failure.

PRESENTATION (1) **COMPONENT LAYOUT**
The AC generators supply a 115 VAC, 3-phase, 400 Hz AC supply. The IDGs
and the APU have a nominal 90 kVA power whereas the EMER
GEN has a 5 kVA output.
The static inverter converts the direct current from battery 1 into an
AC
current if no other source is available.
The Battery Charge Limiters (BCLs) control the battery coupling and
uncoupling to the DC BATTERY BUS to ensure battery charging and
protection. Each battery is rated at 24 V with a capacity of 23 Ah. All
TRs are identical and interchangeable.
In the Electrical Power Generation System (EPGS), the GAPCU controls the
APU GEN and the external power. The Generator Control Units (GCUs)
protect and control the A/C network and generators. GCUs and GAPCU
supply AC electrical power parameters to show them on the ECAM display.
The main C/B panels are located in the cockpit.
The ESS TR is identical to TR 1 and TR 2. It converts 115 VAC to 28
VDC at a rate of 200 A. The EMER GCU connects the EMER GEN to the ESS
network, if all conditions are met.
On the Ground Power Control Panel there are 2 Lights which indicate the
Ground Power Unit availability (AVAIL light) and the connection to the
A/C network (NOT IN USE light). The Ground Power Unit should supply 3
phases 115VAC/400Hz rated at 90 KVA minimum.
The MAINTenance BUS SW lets the AC and DC service buses be supplied
without energizing the whole A/C electrical network.
The aft cabin C/B panel contains only C/Bs.

The IDG has a scavenge and a charge filter. The scavenge filter has an
oil filter Differential Pressure Indicator (DPI). The indicator shows
when it is necessary to replace the oil filter elements. The sensing
device for the oil filter DPI is automatically inhibited during cold
oil-running conditions. This prevents unwanted operation because of a
high oil viscosity.
The clogging indicator of the oil scavenge filter is on the IDG oil-out
line.
It is necessary to replace the two filters elements when the DPI is
extended.

PRESENTATION (1) **SAFETY PRECAUTIONS**
When you do any maintenance task on the electrical system, make sure
that no AC or DC power source is connected to the aircraft electrical
circuits.
Before De-energizing aircraft electrics or before doing the Static
Inverter test, tell all personnel on the aircraft that the lights will
go out.
Some components are heavy. You must make sure that you can hold the
component before its removal/installation. If it falls, it can cause
injury to personnel and damage to the equipment.
Dangerous arcing can occur if external power (GPU or Gate power) is
energized when trying to connect power to the aircraft. Make sure that
external power source is de-energized before connecting.
Components can remain hot for one hour following engine shutdown.
Be careful as hot parts and hot oil can cause injury and burn your eyes
and skin. Use protective clothing, as oil products are poisonous.
**ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS**
Turn-off unused ground service equipment (GPU, Air conditioning cart,
etc\...) if no work is being done or nobody is present on the aircraft.
