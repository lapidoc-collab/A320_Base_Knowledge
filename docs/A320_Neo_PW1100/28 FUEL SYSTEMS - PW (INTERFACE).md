**SYSTEM INTRODUCTION**
**A319/A320**
The new A319/A320 Fuel System is a combination of the common Wing
Structure of the SA Aircrafts manufactured (A318/A319/320) and the Fuel
System Components installed in A321 since entry into service and will be
the manufacturing standard with the beginning of delivery of all NEO
Single Aisle Aircrafts, except the A318.
The benefit to combine both layouts, on the new A319/A320 Fuel System,
is to achieve the following:
\- Weight reduction,
\- Better protection against UERF,
\- Cost improvements,
\- Communality in between all SA Aircraft variants.
Two fuel pumps are installed in each wing tank. One fuel pump is
installed for the APU. Fuel is supplied to the engines from the wing
tanks only. As the fuel level in the wing decreases, the center tank
fuel is transferred to the wing tanks until the center tank is empty.
Fuel transfer from the center tank to the wing tanks is controlled by
transfer valves. When the transfer valves are opened, they supply
pressure to two jet pumps in the center tank and transfer the fuel from
the center tank to the wings.
Two engine LP valves are installed to supply or cut off fuel to the
engines. The LP valve is closed when the related engine is shut down or
when the engine fire pushbutton is released.
A crossfeed valve is installed to connect or isolate the left and right
hand sides. It enables engine to be fed from any available fuel pump.
On the ground, the crossfeed valve enables fuel to be transferred from
tank to tank. The valve is closed for normal operation.
The fuel system also feeds the APU directly from the left hand side.
The APU LP valve is installed to supply or cut off fuel to the APU.
It closes when the APU is shut down or when the APU FIRE
pushbutton is released out.

**SYSTEM INTRODUCTION (continued)**
**A321**
The A321 fuel tanks are integrated into the center fuselage area and the
wings. Like the A318/A319/A320, the center tank is part of the center
wing box but unlike the A318/A319/A320, the wing tanks are not divided.
The tanks are simply called left and right wing tanks.

**SYSTEM INTRODUCTION (continued)**
**A318**
The fuel tanks are integrated into the center fuselage area and the
wings. The A318 center tank is part of the center wing box. The wing
tanks are divided into inner and outer cells. To reduce the structural
load on the wings, the fuel in the outer cells is not used until the
fuel load in the inner cells decreases to a low level.
Two fuel pumps are installed in the center tank, two fuel pumps are
installed in each wing tank inner cell and one fuel pump is installed
for the APU. Fuel is supplied to the engines from the center tank first.
After the center tank is empty, fuel is supplied from the wing inner
cells.
There is no direct supply from the outer cells to the engines. Two
intercell transfer valves in each wing let the fuel transfer from the
outer cells to the inner cells when the low level is reached.
Two engine Low Pressure (LP) valves are installed to supply or cut off
fuel to the engines. The LP valve is closed when the related engine is
shut down or when the engine fire pushbutton is released.
A crossfeed valve is installed to connect or isolate the left and right
hand sides. It enables engine to be fed from any available fuel pump.
On the ground, the crossfeed valve enables fuel to be transferred from
tank to tank. The valve is closed for normal operation.
The fuel system also feeds the APU directly from the left hand side.
The APU LP valve is installed to supply or cut off fuel to the APU.
It closes when the APU is shut down or when the APU FIRE
pushbutton is released out.

**CONTROL AND INDICATING**
This section will highlight the control panels and indications for the
fuel system.
**CONTROL PANELS**
The FUEL control panel is operated from the overhead panel.
The A319/A320/A321 FUEL control panel is very similar to the A318,
except:
\- The fuel transfer link between the center and wing tanks is
indicated,
\- CTR TK XFR is indicated instead of CTR TK PUMPS.
The wing tank pumps are controlled manually but the center tank pumps
are normally controlled automatically. On the A318 fuel control panel,
the MODE SEL P/BSW enables the pilot to select automatic or manual mode
for the center tank pumps.
The MODE SEL P/BSW on the A319/A320/A321FUEL control panel enables the
pilot to select manual or automatic mode for the CTR TK
XFR valves.

**ECAM FUEL PAGE**
The configuration of the fuel system valves and pumps as well as
quantity indications are displayed on the ECAM FUEL system page.
The total Fuel On Board (FOB) indication is duplicated on the
Engine/Warning Display.
Let\'s briefly review all the A321 differences using the ECAM FUEL
page:
\- There is no inner and outer cells in the wing tanks,
\- Fuel is transferred from the center tank to the wing tanks via two
jet pumps and transfer valves,
\- Fuel is always fed to the engines from the wing and not from the
center tank.
For the actual A319/A320 configuration there is a combination of the
A318 and the A321 Fuel System:
\- Still a separation into inner and outer cell for the wing tank
\- Fuel is transferred from the center tank to the wing tanks via two
jet pumps and transfer valves,
\- Fuel is always fed to the engines from the wing and not from the
center tank.

**MAINTENANCE/TEST FACILITIES**
The 2-channel Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC) calculates the
fuel mass, controls automatic refueling and monitors the system with
different interfaces.
The Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCUs) send fuel level signals to
the FQIC and to different aircraft circuits and systems.
They are installed in the avionics compartment.
The BITE test of the FQIC does a check of the Fuel Quantity Indicating
System and the Fuel Level Sensing System (FLSS). The FLSCUs do not
interface directly with the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).

**SAFETY PRECAUTIONS**
When you do work on the aircraft, make sure that you obey all the
Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) safety procedures. This will prevent
injury to persons and/or damage to the aircraft. Here is an overview of
the main safety precautions related to the fuel system.
Aircraft fuel is poisonous. Do not get aircraft fuel in your eyes,
mouth, nose, ears or on your skin.
Use solvents, cleaning agents, sealants or other special materials only
with good airflow in the work area. Use protective clothing to prevent
personal contamination and formation of static electricity.
Make sure that correct firefighting equipment is available.
Make sure that the safety area is clear and clean. Obey the safety
precautions in the safety area.
Put \'\'NO SMOKING\'\' warning notices around the work area.
Ground (earth) and bond the aircraft.
In the work area:
\- Do not use flames without protection and do not use any material or
tools which can cause sparks,
\- Use only approved electrical / electronic equipment,
\- Make sure that the work area has sufficient airflow to do the work
safely.
If not, use a respirator,
\- Do not pull or move metal objects on the ground,
\- Immediately flush away or remove fuel leakage.
During refueling, do not transmit with the HF system. This can cause
fire or injury to personnel.

**FUEL TANK SAFETY**
After three fuel tank explosions in recent decades, which caused in 346
fatalities, the U.S Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), introduced new regulations to improve fuel tank
safety.
These regulations are related to the prevention of ignition sources in
fuel tanks of current type certificated aircraft. To obey these
regulations, a one-time fuel system safety and design review must be
done.
**CRITICAL DESIGN CONFIGURATION CONTROL**
**LIMITATIONS (CDCCL)**
The FAA issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 88, which
gives a detailed description of the CDCCL concept.
The EASA requested the SFAR 88 (TGL 47) to be added to PART
145, PART M and PART 147 to reinforce the application of these
regulations.
This includes:
\- A conception part intended to aircraft design features,
\- A maintenance part.
A CDCCL is a limitation requirement to preserve a critical ignition
source prevention feature of the fuel system design that is necessary to
prevent the occurrence of an unsafe condition.
The function of the CDCCL is to give instructions to prevent critical
ignition source feature from alterations, repairs or maintenance actions
during configuration change.
The aircraft manufacturers must supply a document to their customers to
give the list of all the maintenance tasks impacted by the CDCCL.
For AIRBUS this document is called the Fuel Airworthiness Limitations
and it is added to the Airworthiness Limitation Section part 5.
The CDCCL items are listed in the Airworthiness Limitations Form.
