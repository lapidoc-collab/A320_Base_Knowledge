**GENERAL**
The oxygen system supplies crew and passengers with oxygen in case of
cabin depressurization.
The oxygen system has three different subsystems:
\- cockpit Crew Oxygen System: the oxygen is supplied from a high
pressure oxygen cylinder to quick donning masks in the cockpit (For NEO
aircraft, two segregated oxygen systems supplied by a high-pressure
oxygen cylinder for each),
\- passenger Oxygen System: the passenger and cabin attendant oxygen
system is supplied by chemical oxygen generator units,
\- portable Oxygen System: it has a high pressure portable cylinders
with continuous flow type masks and smoke hoods.

**COCKPIT CREW OXYGEN SYSTEM**
The cockpit crew oxygen system supplies oxygen to the flight crew, in
case of a sudden decrease in cabin pressurization or if there are smoke
or dangerous gases in the cockpit.
**CREW OXYGEN SUPPLY FOR CEO**
The cockpit crew oxygen system has a high-pressure oxygen cylinder that
can be isolated for maintenance by an ON/OFF valve. A pressure regulator
reduces the high pressure to a supply low pressure to the masks via a
supply valve.
The supply valve can be switched off from the cockpit for maintenance
action as well as in ground configuration. The system is protected if an
overpressure occurs in a high or low-pressure circuit. The overpressure
is vented overboard. The oxygen pressure condition is indicated on the
DOOR/OXY page of the ECAM system.

**COCKPIT CREW OXYGEN SYSTEM (continued)** **CREW OXYGEN SUPPLY FOR
NEO**
The cockpit crew oxygen system has two segregated oxygen systems, each
supplied by a high-pressure oxygen cylinder.
Each oxygen cylinder can be isolated for maintenance by an ON/OFF
valve. Each system is equipped with a pressure regulator which reduces
the high pressure to supply low pressure to the masks, via a supply
valve.
The supply valves can be switched off from the cockpit for maintenance
action as well as in ground configuration. The systems are protected if
an overpressure occurs in high or low-pressure circuits.
The overpressure is vented overboard. Both oxygen systems pressure
condition are indicated on the DOOR/OXY page of the ECAM system.

**CONTROL AND INDICATING**
The oxygen control panel, for crew and passengers, is part of the
cockpit overhead panel.
The CREW SUPPLY P/B in OFF position shuts off the supply from the oxygen
cylinder(s) to the crew masks.
The MASK MAN ON P/B electrically controls the opening of the oxygen
container doors. This will be indicated by the SYS ON light.
To reset the passenger oxygen system the TMR RESET P/B has to be
pressed. The P/B also indicates a fault in the system.
