NEW GENERATION AUDIO SYSTEM (3)
**DIGITAL RADIO AND AUDIO INTERGRATING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DRAIMS)** A
new digital audio cockpit system will bring significant improvements to
pilots and aircraft operations compared to current analogue audio.
The Digital Radio and Audio Integrating Management System (DRAIMS)
received EASA certification in March 2020 for the A320
Family.
The digital audio system will become the baseline for the A320 Family of
aircraft over the next few years (and A330/A350) Here we look at the
changes to the aircraft systems architecture linked to the installation
of digital audio, what benefits it brings and the different operating
modes from a flight crew perspective.

availability in the case of degraded electrical configurations.
The Human Machine Interface (HMI) is principally based on two separate
control panels, the Radio Management Panel (RMP) and the Audio Control
Panel (ACP). There is some limited synchronisation between RMPs, and in
case of system failure requiring reconfiguration, the flight crew need
to intervene manually (AUDIO SWITCHING
control).
The digital audio system is designed to:
• improve and streamline the architecture, simplifying installation and
increasing robustness
• update the HMI to bring it into line with solutions available on the
A350 and A380
• increase synchronisation and simplify operating procedures to reduce
crew workload
• integrate additional functions and provide provisions for future
upgrades and aircraft dispatch capability /remove airline tasks

**VHF AND HF PAGES**
The VHF and HF pages show the active and standby frequencies, or DATA if
selected, on all available radios. The squawk code and TCAS
shortcuts remain displayed.
Standby frequencies are entered by selecting the relevant LSK on the
right hand side (cyan box appears) and using the numeric keypad. A push
on the relevant LSK on the left hand side swaps the active and standby
frequencies.
Partially entered frequencies are completed (if valid) and invalid
frequencies are highlighted in amber and accompanied with information in
the message area.
If a radio has its transmission key selected, the name is shown in green
reverse video, e.g. VHF1
If a radio has its reception knob selected, a loudspeaker symbol is
shown. The loudspeaker symbol is shown crossed out if a radio is
selected for transmission, but not reception.
For HF radios, the modulation mode can be selected. The selected mode is
shown in cyan reverse video, e.g. ON
If a SELCAL is received, the RESET message is shown in the message area,
a buzzer sounds, and the associated transmission key flashes amber.
In CPDLC operations, the message area shows a LOAD message if the
appropriate uplink is received from the active ATC centre.

**NAV PAGE**
The upper part of the NAV page is used to activate the STBY NAV
function in case of FMS failure.
After selecting STBY NAV, the access to all available RAD NAV
means according to aircraft configuration is given via the LSK on the
left hand side of the screen (for example, LS or VOR). Selecting those
LSK gives access to sub-menus which can be used to enter frequency/
channel and course information.
If the STBY NAV function is activated, an indication STBY NAV is shown
in reverse video on VHF, HF and TEL pages.
The lower part of the NAV page is used for listening to the different
NAVAIDS (AUDIO NAV). Only the installed NAVAIDS are shown on the screen.
The right hand LSK cycles through all the available means.
Once selected, the NAVAID signal can be heard using the NAV
reception knob. For installed NAVAIDS which make use of the BFO
signal, the VOICE ON/OFF command is displayed and can be selected using
the relevant LSK.
**MENU PAGE**
The MENU page can show different prompts for the LSK according to the
aircraft configuration.
One example of information shown on this page includes the SELCAL code
and access to the SATCOM SETTINGS sub-menu.
