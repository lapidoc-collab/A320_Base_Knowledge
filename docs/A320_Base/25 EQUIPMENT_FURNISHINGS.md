COCKPIT EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT PRESENTATION (2) EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT The
emergency equipment for a 4-seat cockpit consists of: - two escape
ropes, - one fire extinguisher, - two smoke hoods, - one pair of fire
protective gloves, - one crash axe, - four life vests, - one medical
kit, - four oxygen masks, - three flash lights, - one portable oxygen
bottle. As an option, two flashlights can be installed under sliding
window. These flashlights replace the two flashlights installed under
the sidesticks. They can be used by crew members in case of bad lights
occurring during an on-board emergency.
Some in life modifications involve some operators that have reported the
failure of the cockpit additional electrical-supply static inverter (FIN
3NA) leading to "strong acrid electrical type" smell followed by light
smoke from the central pedestal in the cockpit. The failed static
inverters are fitted on their power supply board with a capacitor which
can fail and overheat at a point in time leading, subsequently, to
electrical smell and light smoke in the cockpit. Available enhancements
This modification consists in replacing the defective capacitor by a new
one through the embodiment of VSB 1830-25-37. This embodiment fulfils
one of the requirements of the Airbus Inspections Service Bulletins
(ISB) A320-25-1BJF and A320-25-1BJH.

COCKPIT SEATS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) LUMBAR REST
PILOT SEATS Seat movements can be electrically or manually adjusted.
VERTICAL TRAVEL To adjust the seat upwards or downwards, pull the
control handle marked "V" to unlock the seat. For manual control: - take
your weight off the seat and adjust the seat to the required position, -
release the handle to lock the seat, - to adjust the seat downwards the
procedure is similar, your weight is sufficient to move the seat
downwards, - the down movement of the seat is slowed down by means of a
gas cylinder. For electrical control, place the control switch in the UP
or DOWN position until the seat reaches the required position.
HORIZONTAL TRAVEL To move the seat forwards or backwards pull the
control handle marked "H" to unlock the seat. For manual control: - when
the desired position is reached, release the handle to lock the seat.
For electrical control, place the control switch in the FWD or REAR
position until the seat reaches the required position. The positions of
the seat are adjusted according to the indicators (2 red and 1 white
balls) located on the center window frame between the two windshields.
BACKREST Pull the control handle marked "R" to adjust the backrest
position. The system is controlled via two cables. A gas cylinder acts
as a return spring for the backwards movement of the backrest.

Two coaxial knobs enable vertical and horizontal lumbar rest adjustment.
Rotation of the triangular knob is used for the depth adjustment of the
lumbar rest. Rotation of the second serrated knob is used for the
vertical movement of the lumbar rest.
INBOARD ARMREST The inboard armrest can be raised vertically and stowed
behind the backrest. The inboard armrest is on the center pedestal side.
Tilt angle adjustment is made using a knob installed on the front.
SIDE STICK ARMREST The side stick armrest comprises the fixed arm, the
carrier arm and the side stick table. The fixed arm is attached to the
seat pan. It supports the carrier arm and side stick table assembly.
Side stick table height adjustment is controlled by a wheel installed on
the armrest. The side stick table tilt angle is controlled by a wheel
installed on the front of the armrest. A position indicator installed on
top of the table shows a reference to height and tilt position. A wheel
avoids interference between the armrest and the lateral console when the
seat is moved forwards with the table fully inclined.
SAFETY HARNESS The shoulder harness is put on an inertia reel which can
be locked by a control lever installed behind the backrest Some in life
changes to the flight deck include - An updated design of the lateral
stowage boxes, to change the material of construction from Honeycomb to
Aluminium. The new folded and welded aluminium alloy stowage box
provides protection to the adjacent systems (Oxygen etc) providing
better Portable Electronic Devices (PED) runaway fire containment
capability.

HEATED FLOOR PANEL SYSTEM D/O (OPTION) (3) GENERAL As the door cutouts
cannot be insulated as efficiently as the rest of the fuselage, the
temperatures at these door areas become very low in flight. In order to
improve this situation, in some of the affected areas the floor panels
can optionally be heated, i.e. those of the front doors (door area 1)
with all Airbus Single Aisle aircraft and those of the center and
emergency exits (door areas 2 and 3) with A321. The areas of the aft
doors, however, are never heated with either aircraft.

Due to the temperature situation at door area 1, the floor panels are
heated to increase passenger and cabin crew comfort. The system
comprises two control units and four heated floor panels (two on each
door area 1). Each of the control units controls and monitors the heater
assemblies of one side of the door area (two heater elements, one for
each of two panels at R/H or L/H door). Each heated floor panel has an
electrical heating foil protected with aluminum outer cover plate. In
order to minimize heat loss, insulation material is installed to the
bottom of the floor panel below the heating foil. The heated floor panel
has two drain holes, one on each side, and is shaped to drain away any
water that collects on the panel when the door is open.

HEATED FLOOR PANEL SYSTEM D/O (OPTION) (3) OPERATION The heating system
comes into operation as soon as the supplying electrical bus bars 212XP,
214XP and 602PP are energized. The control unit maintains a panel
surface temperature between 29°C and 32°C. For this purpose it compares
the temperature recorded by the sensors in the heating circuit to two
stored threshold values. If the actual temperature drops below the lower
value, the control unit activates the relay to supply the heater circuit
with 115V AC. When the upper temperature threshold is exceeded the relay
is de-activated interrupting the heater power. If this temperature
regulation fails, two over-temperature switches, connected in series
interrupt the power circuit protecting the heating elements from damage
as follows: - If the temperature exceeds 55°C the first over-temperature
switch opens, thus interrupting the power circuit to the heater. Once
the temperature drops below this threshold, the switch closes again and
re-activates the heating of the panel. - If the temperature exceeds 70°C
(because the first over-temperature switch had failed) the second one
opens cutting the heater power supply irreversibly. The self-locking
status switch (in "open" position) will only be released after the whole
heating system is de-energized. This reset is done automatically. The
heated floor panels are supplied with 115V AC from bus bars 212XP and
214XP distributed via control units.

HEATED FLOOR PANEL SYSTEM D/O (OPTION) (3) BUILT-IN-TEST The
Built-In-Test (BIT) function is activated by a "TEST" pushbutton
installed on the front cover of the control unit. It checks the
following items on each of the two heater circuits: - Measuring range of
the temperature sensor - Heater elements and connections (open or
short) - Temperature sensor and connections (open or short) - Heater
current - Heater control circuits - Power supply - Solid-state relays -
Interface connections Correct function of these items is indicated by a
sum-signal which gives light to two LEDs, one for each heater circuit,
installed next either side of the P/B. In case of a detected fault, the
related light of the affected heater circuit remains off. This manually
initiated BIT is the only way to monitor proper operation of the floor
panel heating system. The control units are supplied with 28V DC from
bus bar 602PP during the BIT operation. Micro fuses on the front cover
of the unit protect the heater circuits.

door escape slide. The Flapper valve is closed. The Pressure from the
Inflation Reservoir flows into the nozzle array. Due to the high flow
the flapper valve opens against the spring force. When the slide
inflation pressure reaches its nominal value, the flapper valve closes
by spring force. The remaining reservoir pressure is used to maintain
the slide pressure for a given time. After inflation the maintenance
will deflate the slide by manually opening the flapper valve.

INSTALLATION Do a check of the general condition of the slide pack
assembly. Before you start the work, make sure that the safety/ lock pin
is correctly installed in the regulator valve assembly. Make sure that
the pressure gage shows a sufficient pressure level. Check that the
manual inflation handle is connected to the inflation cable. Before you
install the girt bar, you have to disconnect the loop of the cover
release-cable. Make sure that the electrical connector is closed and
installed in the correct position. Place the electrical wiring according
the side that the slide needs to be installed on. The electrical harness
must come out of he side of the girt assembly in flight direction. To
place the harness correctly, follow the instructions on the pack
assembly. Now the pack assembly is ready to install the girt bar.
Install a temporary tie on the small cord loop. Install the mooring line
on the left side of the girt bar and place the girt bar between the
short and the long girt extension flap. Make sure that the visual
indicator faces inboard and forward. Pull the cord loops through the
grommets in the short girt flap. Start at each edge of the girt assembly
and pull the cord loops through each other to the small cord loop at the
centre. Place the handle wire loop over the small cord loop before you
place the long cord loop over the centre. Secure it with the
parachute-pin before you continue the pull the cord loops from the other
end towards the centre. Secure both long cord loops over the centre with
e parachute-pin and remove the temporary tie. Safety the parachute-pin
by using a specific nylon thread. 1 clove hitch on the long side of the
pin. 3 Half hitches on the short pin end followed by 3 half hitches on
the wire end of the pin, secured with a square knot. Attach the handle
to the Velcro-tape and putt the release wire along the girt assembly.
Finally fold the long girt flap over the girt bar and attach it to the
short girt flap Velcro-tape. Make sure you keep the mooring line as
short as possible, and that you stow away the excessive length back
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
into the girt extension. Fold the long girt flap over the girt bar and
attach it to the short girt flap Velcro-tape. Now the cover release
cable needs to be reconnected to prepare the slide for the installation
on the door. Before you start with the installation of the slide, make
sure that the EMERgency EXIT LightT. Switch on the 25VU is set to "off".
Install the safety/lock pin on the percussion mechanism of the door
damper and emergency-operation cylinder and set the percussion lever to
the disarmed position. Check that the door is set to the disarmed
position and the lock-pin is engaged. Close the door and install the
pack-assembly on the door support hooks. Hold it at an angle and connect
the electrical connector of the slide to the door. Install the bolts and
the washers on the forward and aft end of the pack-board. Tighten them
to the required value with a torque wrench. Afterwards check that there
is no more play between the slide pack-board and the door. Set the door
to the ARMED configuration and open door. Open the door with the control
handle and hold the door to prevent the door to fully open. Install the
girt bar with both ends into the floor attach fittings until the spring
pawls click into position. Carefully lower and lock the door with the
control handle. Make sure that the control shaft levers engage correctly
in the holes of the girt bar. Make sure that the girt bar engages
correctly in the telescopic forks, when you set the door to the disarmed
position. Do an operational test of the arming mechanism by arming the
door and lift it carefully. Check that the girt bar engages into the
floor attach fittings. Prevent the door from moving to the fully open
position. Lower and lock the door again. Set the emergency control
handle to the disarmed position and check that the girt bar moves back
into the telescopic fork. Safety the door in the disarmed position,
remove the safety pin from the pack assembly and stow it in the pocket
on the slide assembly. Position the decorative cover with the upper end
on the upper end of the slide pack board. Align the spring loaded
latches to match with the brackets on the slide. Close them. Push the
lower edge of the decorative cover against the pack-assembly until the
spring clips engage.

NOTE: In this module the PASSENGER DOOR SLIDE DEPLOYMENT/DESCRIPTION is
described on the A320 but the principle is the same for the A318, the
A319 and the A321.
NORMAL OPERATION As soon as the door handle is lifted, the door is
pneumatically pushed open and the slide raft, fixed with a girt bar to
the cabin floor, is pulled out of the container, drops down and inflates
automatically. As the inflatable falls down, the inflation system is
activated. The gas stored in the inflation cylinder is discharged
through flexible hoses to the aspirators. The aspirator flaps open and
ambient air is drawn in under partial vacuum, created by the high
velocity in the venturi. Then the flaps close and the remaining gas,
tops up the inflatable to its operational pressure. Should the automatic
inflation system fail, the slide raft must be inflated manually.
MANUAL OPERATION For that, the red manual inflation handle located on
the RH side of the girt extension must be pulled. In case of a ditching,
prior to door opening the survival kit must be connected to the slide
raft. The survival kit is stored in the nearest overhead bin. Place the
survival kit on the floor, FWD of the door and detach the lanyard from
the girt bar. Pull the lanyard and the hook, to snap on the front of the
survival kit. Then open the door. The slide raft drops out of the
container and deploys.

OFFWING ESCAPE SLIDE DEPLOYMENT / DESCRIPTION (3) OFFWING ESCAPE SLIDE
DEPLOYMENT The offwing escape slide is packed in a container assembly,
which in turn is mounted into the center fuselage belly fairing. Two
type 3 exits installed over each wing, are always in armed
configuration. The opening of one wing exit will start the deployment
sequence. The escape slide inflates automatically and is ejected out of
its containers and deploys in approximately four seconds. The inflation
system is composed of an inflation cylinder, which is installed in the
aft cargo compartment. Activation of the release mechanism starts the
inflation sequence. The gas stored in the cylinder is discharged to the
inflatable through flexible hoses and an aspirator. The aspirator flaps
open and ambient air is drawn into the slide. A red manual inflation
handle, installed on each exit frame, must be pulled to manually
activate the inflation and deployment sequence, in case of automatic
release failure. NOTE: In this module the OFFWING ESCAPE SLIDE
DEPLOYMENT is described on the A320 but the principle is the same for
the A318 and A319.

EMERGENCY EXIT ESCAPE SLIDE DEPLOYMENT/DESCR. (A321) (3)
DESCRIPTION/DEPLOYMENT The escape slide for the type "C" doors, is
stored underneath the door inside the fuselage. The inflation cylinder
is located in the overhead bin, over the door. The cylinder is in a
protection box and can be seen through a plexiglass window. The pressure
can be checked on the pressure level indicator. For correct pressure the
needle must be in the green section. To initiate the slide deployment,
the door must be opened in the armed configuration. To open the door,
uncover the control handle, lift the handle fully up, and release it.
are located on both sides for assisting people to hold the slide in case
it is used not inflated as an evacuation chute. The slide is slightly
canted in order to deploy at a safe distance away from the engine.
CAUTION: Door opening pneumatically assisted when opened in armed mode.
The door opens outwards and then opens quickly. The escape slide in the
meantime inflates and deploys completely. The escape slide is ready for
use when the door is locked in the fully open position. Should the door
open but the escape slide not inflate, a red handle for manual inflation
is located in the door upper right hand frame. The transparent
protective cover must be taken off and the red handle pulled to initiate
the manual slide inflation. The escape slide for the type "C" doors is
stowed in a special compartment in the fuselage, underneath the door.
The deployment sequence starts as soon as the door is opened in armed
configuration. One aspirator is connected to the inflation cylinder by
means of a flexible hose. During the door opening the inflation cylinder
regulator valve is actuated, and primary gas is supplied to the
aspirator. The aspirator flaps open and outside air is drawn in. The
flaps close as soon as the correct pressure is reached. The slide has a
single lane sliding surface with a brake path at the bottom end, which
slows down the speed of the evacuees. A lighting system is fitted along
both sides and at the bottom of the slide. The lights automatically come
on during the slide deployment. They remain on as long as the emergency
power supply operates. A re-entry strap is fixed on one side of the
slide. A yellow life line is fixed along the outside of the inflation
chambers on both sides. Red no-fail handles

EMERGENCY EXIT ESCAPE SLIDE INSTALLATION (A321) (3) INSTALLATION The
installation procedures are given for the escape slide stowage
compartment located below the left door 3. The procedures for
compartments located below the right door 3 and the left and right door
2 are almost the same. Make sure that the flaps are retracted. Warning:
make sure that the locking pin assembly is correctly installed in the
operating head of the inflation reservoir. It prevents an accidental
extension of the escape slide. Make sure that the operating striker
lever of the door damper and emergency operating cylinder is in the
disarmed position. The slide control handle must be in the disarmed
position and the safety pin installed. Open the door and make sure that
the manual inflation handle is in its correct position. Put the access
platform in position at the escape slide stowage compartment. Do a check
of the aircraft stowage compartment recess and the stowage compartment
attach panel. Make sure that the location pin hole in the attach panel
aligns with the location pin on the aircraft stowage compartment recess.
The escape slides for the left and the right doors 2 and 3 are not
interchangeable. The location pin installed on the aircraft stowage
compartment recess prevents incorrect installation. Make a visible
inspection of the door lock mechanism on the stowage compartment blowout
door. To finish the escape slide installation preparation, remove the
blanking plugs. Here you can see the safety tool for slide installation.
This tool must be installed on the slide pack and on the stowage
compartment recess. Now, tighten the inflation hose and assembly on the
fuselage union. Make sure you do not twist the inflation hose when you
tighten the end assembly on the fuselage union. This could damage the
inflation hose. Install the emergency lighting electrical connector and
fix the bonding strap. Put the escape slide stowage compartment in
position and remove the safety tool. Then, tighten the panel attach
studs. Finally, put the belly fairing panel in position and close the
panel attach latch mechanism.

the joystick to the IN position when the container is over the lateral
Power Drive Unit (PDU). At the end of the lateral travel, move the
joystick in the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal PDUs are now
moving the container to the desired position. When the container has
reached its position, release the joystick. You need to lock the
container in position by raising the XZ-latch. The PDU underneath the
container is now de-energized. Load the other containers by following
the same procedure. The override-able sill latches move upwards by
springs to prevent the container from rolling out again. The lateral PDU
roller will rise and rotate in the desired direction when the joystick
lateral direction command is operated. The longitudinal PDU is
controlled in the same way. When the last container is loaded, switch
off the control panel power, raise the two manual sill latches and
switch off the compartment lights.

DRAINING SYSTEM D/O (3) FWD CARGO COMPARTMENT DESCRIPTION The drainage
system is installed at the aft end of the compartment at FR 34 below the
cargo compartment floor. The system collects and lets rain water,
condensation and spilt liquids flow out of the cargo compartment. The
drainage system has filters, filter housings, drain funnels, elbows and
flexible hoses. The filter and filter housing are installed on the cargo
compartment drain outlets. The filter prevents a blockage of the drain
system. The drain funnels are installed beneath the drain outlets.
Flexible hoses connect the drain funnels to the elbows. From the elbows,
the flexible hoses end at a mutual tee. The flexible hoses are secured
in position with straps.
OPERATION The rain water, condensation and spilt liquids that may have
collected in the cargo compartment, flow out through the drain outlets.
From the drain outlets, the liquids move through drain funnels, elbows
and flexible houses into the tee. The tee lets the liquid out into the
bilge (fuselage lower shell) where the collected liquid is let out of
the A/C through drain valves. The drain valves are installed in the
fuselage structure near to the lowest points. The drain valves close to
prevent loss of cabin pressure (when cabin pressurization reaches 2
psi/0.1378 bar). As the cabin decreases below the preset value (normally
after the A/C has landed), the drain valves open under spring tension to
allow any water that has collected to drain away.

CARGO COMPARTMENT DECOMPRESSION PANEL D/O (3) RAPID DECOMPRESSION PANELS
DESCRIPTION The rapid decompression panels (blow-in/blow-out) are
installed in the ceiling panels and in the fixed partition walls. They
prevent damage to the aircraft structure in case of sudden pressure
difference. The system prevents a pressure difference between different
areas in the aircraft (cockpit/cabin, or cabin/cargo compartment). The
panels have a composite structure made of a honeycomb-core and a
flame-retardant laminated-skin. Foam-tape is bonded into the recess of
the panel border and makes a seal between the panel and the frame. There
is a flame-retardant strip between the Foam-tape and the border edge.
The Panel assemblies include a panel, a frame and fastener assemblies.
The fastener assemblies are attached to the frames and include some
latches, springs and catches. Optionally, protection devices can be
installed on the FWD cargo to protect the rapid decompression panels.

OPERATION If a rapid-decompression occurs in the Cabin, the higher air
pressure pushes the panel against their fasteners. This force will
release the catches and the panels are blown outboard (Blow-out). The
higher air pressure can flow from the cargo compartment to the Cabin. If
a rapid-decompression occurs in the cargo compartment, the higher air
pressure pushes the panel assemblies against their fasteners. This force
will release the catches and the panel assemblies are blown inboard
(Blow-in). The higher air pressure can flow from the cabin to the Cargo
Compartment.

INDICATION CHECK (IF NOT CONNECTED TO CIDS) The PAX door escape slide
and its inflation reservoir are installed on a pack board at the bottom
of the door behind a decorative cover. The inflation reservoir is part
of the slide pack assembly. The inflation reservoir pressure can be
checked through a pressure gage. Moreover, the door escape slide/raft
pressure indication check must be done in relation with the Maintenance
Planning Document (MPD) (600FH, 750FC, 100 days). A correct indication
is shown when: - the gage needle is in the green band, - or on the right
of the green band. An incorrect indication is shown when the gage needle
is on the left of the green cursor.
-   the escape-slide. To disarm the percussion mechanism of the door
    damper and emergency operation cylinder you have to:
-   install the SAFETY/LOCK PIN,
-   remove and discard the lockwire from the knurled screw,
-   loosen the knurled screw,
-   pull back the striker lever to disarm it,
-   tighten the knurled screw. To safety the inflation reservoir of the
    escape-slide you have to:
-   install the safety/lock pin assembly in the valve/regulator assembly
    of the inflation reservoir. NOTE: The safety/lock pin assembly is
    kept in a stowage pocket on the soft-cover of the pack-assembly.
NOTE: The cursor is sensitive to temperature changes and moves
independently of the gage needle. It reacts to temperature changes
faster than the gas expansion in the inflation reservoir If the gage
shows an incorrect indication wait for temperature conditions to become
stable, then examine the gage again. If the gage continues to show an
incorrect indication, you must replace the slide pack assembly.
