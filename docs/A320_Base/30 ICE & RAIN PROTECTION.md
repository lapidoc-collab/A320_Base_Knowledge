ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The ice and rain protection system enables unrestricted operation in
icing conditions and heavy rain. For anti-icing, hot air or electrical
heating protects critical areas of the aircraft. The different
subsystems of the ice and rain protection system are: - wing ice
protection, - engine air intake ice protection, - probe ice
protection, - windshield ice and rain protection, - drain mast ice
protection, - water and waste system ice protection (some are
optional). - visual lighted ice detection, - electronic ice detection
system (optional),
WING ANTI ICE PROTECTION Hot air from the pneumatic system is provided
for the anti-icing of the three outboard leading edge slats (3, 4 and 5)
of each wing. Bleed air from the engines or the APU is supplied to each
wing through a pressure regulating and shut off valve. Wing anti-ice
supply to both wings is controlled by a single pushbutton switch on the
overhead ANTI ICE panel.
engine is running. Ice protection of the Angle Of Attack (AOA) sensors,
pitot probes, static ports, and Total Air Temperature (TAT) probes is
achieved by electrical heating. The PROBE/WINDOW HEAT pushbutton switch
(normally in the AUTO position) may be used to select the probe heating
ON with the engines shut down.
WINDSHIELD ANTI ICE PROTECTION Electrical heating is provided for
windshield anti-icing and cockpit side window de-fogging. The front
windshields and side windows are heated AUTOMATICALLY when at least one
engine is running. The PROBE/WINDOW HEAT pushbutton switch (normally in
the AUTO position) may be used to select the window heating ON with the
engines shut down.
DRAIN MAST ICE PROTECTION When the electrical system is powered, the
waste water Drain Masts are also electrically heated. The Drain Mast
Heating is switched ON when the temperature is below a specific value.
It is not always in operation. There are two Drain Masts located on the
lower fuselage forward and aft sections. Two Control Units, located in
the cargo compartments, control the Heating of the FWD and AFT Drain
Masts.
ENGINE AIR INTAKE ANTI ICE PROTECTION Each engine air intake is
protected from ice by an independent air bleed supply from the
high-pressure compressor of that engine. The air is supplied through the
engine air intake anti-ice valve. Engine anti-ice is manually selected
by the crew and is available in flight or on the ground with the engine
running.
PROBE ICE PROTECTION In order to provide reliable information for the
air data systems, the air data probes are heated AUTOMATICALLY when at
least one

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) SOURCES
PRESSURE SWITCH
The air for wing anti-icing is supplied by the pneumatic system.
The two pressure switches monitor the pressure downstream of the
butterfly valve to sense a valve malfunction. If the pressure increases
to 2.1 bar (30.5 psi) the related switch gives a "high pressure" signal.
If the pressure decreases to 1.0 bar (14.5 psi) the related switch gives
a "low pressure" signal.
VALVES Hot air from the pneumatic system is supplied to each wing by an
electrically controlled, pneumatically operated anti-ice control valve.
The anti-ice control valves regulate the anti-icing pressure to
approximately 23 psi. The valves also include high and low pressure
switches to monitor the regulation function of the valve. In case of
electrical failure or lack of pneumatic supply pressure, the valve
closes.
CONTROLS The wing anti-ice control valves are controlled from the
cockpit by the WING Anti-Ice P/B. On the ground for test functions, a
time-delay relay limits the opening of the valve to 30 seconds when the
pushbutton switch is selected ON.
DUCTS Air reaches slat 3 through a telescopic duct. It is distributed to
the outboard slats by piccolo ducts, interconnected by flexible
connections. A restrictor located downstream from the control valve
adjusts the airflow. It also limits the flow in case of rupture of a
distribution duct.
USERS Only the three outboard slats are protected by the hot anti-icing
air. Due to the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, slats 1 and 2
do not need to be protected.

SYSTEM INTERFACES (3) P/BSW The Wing Anti-Ice (WAI) P/BSW lets the WAI
system be activated either during flight operation or during ground test
operation for a limited time. It also sends the P/BSW configuration to
the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) and to the Engine
Interface Units (EIUs). The WAI P/BSW acquires a discrete signal from
the fault relay for the illumination of the FAULT light, during either
valves transit or in case of disagreement between valves position and
system selection or in case of LP detection.
EIU The EIUs acquire system selection for engine power increase
according to the bleed demand.
LGCIU The Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) send a shock
absorber extended signal to the control relay to enable the system to be
controlled when the A/C is in flight configuration.
SDAC The SDACs acquire discrete inputs to display the system status on
the ECAM warning page, ECAM MEMO page and ECAM BLEED page.
ACSC The Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) 1 and 2 are
interfacing with signals from the wing ice protection system. The ACSC
acquires discrete inputs, to monitor the system and manage the bleed
air. It stores failure data of the WAI system.

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) USERS
CONTROLS
The engine air intake is protected by its related bleed air, which heats
the inlet leading edge in icing conditions. The hot air is then
discharged overboard.
For each engine, the anti-ice valve is controlled by a P/BSW located on
the ANTI ICE section of the overhead panel. When the engine Anti-ice
(A.ICE) valve is open, a signal is sent to the Air Conditioning System
Controller (ACSC), which calculates the bleed air demand and sends the
signal tothe Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) via the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The additional bleed demand decreases the
maximum N1 for the CFM56 and PW6000 and the maximum Engine Pressure
Ratio (EPR) limit for the V2500 relative to the ambient conditions and
the engine operating conditions.
SOURCE Hot air for the engine anti-ice system is supplied by a dedicated
HP Compressor (HPC) bleed: - on the V2500, 7th stage, - on the CFM-56,
5th stage, - on the PW6000, 9th stage. The nacelle installed on CFM56
TECH INSERTION: The modified Nacelle Anti-Icing (NAI) supply duct with
the restrictor is required because of the new HPC higher air pressure
and temperature at the 5th stage customer bleed ports. It complies with
the certification requirement in case of duct rupture or failure
occurring in the area of the NAI bleed air supply.
ECAM PAGE If at least one of the two engine air intake anti-ice
protection systems is selected ON, a message appears in green on the
upper ECAM MEMO display. The signal received by EIU is used to avoid an
unwanted anti ice fault ECAM warning on ground, when the engine is not
running.
VALVE The engine anti-ice system supply is controlled by an electrically
controlled, pneumatically operated anti-ice valve. The solenoid is
energized to CLOSE the valve, so in case of loss of electrical power
supply, the valve will go fully open provided the engine bleed air
supply pressure is high enough. In the absence of air pressure, the
valve is spring-loaded to the closed position. NOTE: Note: The anti-ice
valve of the CFM-56 engine uses an external 9th stage muscle supply to
open the valve.

SYSTEM INTERFACES (3) P/BSW The P/BSW sends a discrete signal to the
solenoid to open or close the valve, this information is also sent to
the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDAC). The "FAULT" light
comes on either during valve transit or in case of disagreement between
valve position and system selection.
SDAC The SDAC acquire the P/BSW configuration and the "FAULT" condition
information to display system status on the ECAM warning page and ECAM
MEMO page.
ACSC The Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) 1 is responsible for
the bleed management when the engine Anti Ice (A.ICE) system is switched
ON. ACSC acquires the "valve not closed" position information from the
valve position switch for bleed air management.

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) FUNCTION The static ports, Angle-Of-Attack
(AOA), pitot and Total Air Temperature (TAT) probes are electrically
heated to prevent ice formation. The CAPT, F/O and STBY systems are
independent. Each one includes a Probe Heat Computer (PHC), which
controls probe and static ports heating. As there are only 2 TAT probes,
the first one on the CAPT and the second one on the F/O, PHC 3 is not
linked to a TAT probe.
CONTROL The probes and static ports heating come on automatically when
at least one engine is running. It can also be manually activated by the
PROBE/WINDOW HEAT P/B. On ground, pitot heating is reduced and TAT
heating is cut off, the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units
(LGCIUs) control both. The Probe Heating System is also switched ON
automatically when the LCGIU sends a FLIGHT signal.
PHC Heating monitoring and fault indication is given by the related PHC.
A probe or a sensor heating failure is sent to the ECAM via an Air
Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and the Flight Warning Computers
(FWC). The PHC also transmits fault messages to the Centralized Fault
Display Interface Unit (CFDIU).
CAUTION Pulling the PHC or Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply C/Bs
causes unwanted heating of the probes and static ports. The system is
also switched ON when the C/B of the LGCIU 1 and 2 is pulled (Flight
signal).

ADIRU In case of a probe-heating fault the PHC sends a discrete output
to its respective Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU), which in
turn transmits the failure to the Flight Warning Computers (FWC).
CFDIU The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) is connected
to the PHC for fault system transmission. The PHC is a type 2 system:
ARINC 429 output and maintenance test discrete input.
ENGINE RELAYS The Engine Interface Unit (EIU) energizes the oil
low-pressure and ground relays, when the related engine is not running.

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) FUNCTION Windshields and side windows are
electrically heated to maintain clear visibility in icing or misting
conditions. The system is made up of two independent systems. Each one
includes one Window Heat Computer (WHC), one windshield and two windows,
one fixed and one sliding.
CONTROL Windshield and windows heating comes on automatically when at
least one engine is running. It can also be manually activated by the
PROBE/WINDOW HEAT P/B. The windshield heating operates at low power on
the ground and high power in flight.
WHC Temperature regulation, overheat protection and fault indication are
given by each WHC. In case of a windshield or window heating fault, the
WHC sends an output signal to the ECAM via the System Data Acquisition
Concentrator (SDAC). The WHCs also transmit fault messages to the
Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU).
CAUTION CAUTION: Pulling the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply
C/Bs causes the unwanted heating of the windshield and the side windows.
If you have to pull the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU)
power supply C/Bs or before you lift the aircraft on jacks you have to
accomplish the Flight Configuration Precautions, this prevents unwanted
heating of the windshield and side windows.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) ENGINE RELAYS
GENERAL The window and windshield anti-icing and demisting system is
designed to maintain clear visibility through the cockpit front and side
windows in icing or misting conditions. Windshields are de-iced, sliding
and fixed windows are demisted.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Window Heat Computer (WHC) is supplied with 28
VDC. The fixed and sliding side windows are supplied with 115 VAC and
the windshield is supplied with 200 VAC (dual phase 115 V AC).
CONTROL The heating is cut off, when the three ground signals are sent
to the AND logic. The windshield and windows are heated either when one
engine is running (AUTO) or when the PROBE/WINDOW HEAT P/B is set to ON.
COMPUTER WHC 1 controls and monitors the left hand side of the system
and WHC 2 controls and monitors the right hand side. The WHC identifies
and memorizes the faulty component. It also incorporates protection
against over voltage due to lightning strike or static electricity on
the windows. The WHC supplies independent temperature regulation between
35 and 42°C (95 and 107.6°F). For safety: heating is cut off if
temperature reaches +/-60°C (140 or -76°F).
Oil LOW PRESSure and GrouND ReLaYs are energized by the Engine Interface
Unit (EIU), when the related engine is not running.
LGCIU Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) inputs are used
for the two heating levels of the windshield. The power is reduced on
ground. When flight configuration is detected, the windshield is fully
heated by the dual phase current.
SDAC The System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) receive two
discrete inputs from each WHC, one for the windshield and one for both
windows to tell the crew about a heating fault.
CFDIU The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) is connected
to the WHC for fault system transmission. The WHC is a type 2 system,
with an ARINC 429 output and a maintenance test discrete input.
USERS Each window comprises a heating element and two single loop
sensors; one of the two sensors is a spare. Each windshield has a
heating element and three loop sensors; only one sensor can be connected
at a time. If that sensor fails, the maintenance has to swap the
connectors to the spare sensor! The third sensor is an option.

RAIN REPELLENT SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) FUNCTION In heavy rain
conditions, a rain repellent liquid, stored in a pressurized bottle, may
be sprayed on the windshield to improve visibility. The spray nozzles
are permanently purged by air from cabin hot air supply.
CONTROL When the RAIN Repellent (RPLNT) P/B is pressed in, the solenoid
valve opens for a short time. This causes a measured quantity of rain
repellent liquid to be sprayed on to the related windshield. To repeat
the cycle, the P/B must be pressed again. On ground, the rain repellent
system is inhibited when both engines are shut down.
CAUTION Make sure that the fluid does not stay on the A/C structure. If
the fluid gets on the A/C structure, wash it off immediately with soap
and water. CAUTION: Do not apply the rain repellent fluid on a dry
surface.

RAIN REPELLENT SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The system is designed to improve
visibility through the windshield in heavy rain, particularly when the
wipers are not sufficient. The system operates independently on the CAPT
side and on the F/O side.
RAIN REPELLENT CIRCUIT The rain repellent fluid used is packaged in a
nitrogen-pressurized can. The can is directly attached to the rain
repellent fluid gauge. A purge P/B is used when the can is replaced. A
nozzle sprays the rain repellent fluid onto the related windshield
through four orifices. The spray nozzles are symmetrical but not
interchangeable: - the CAPT spray nozzle is identified with red paint
mark, - the F/O spray nozzle is identified with yellow paint mark.
PURGE CIRCUIT The spray nozzle lines are permanently purged by air from
cabin hot air supply. The blow-out reservoir works as a pressure
accumulator, a decanting reservoir and has a test connection.
OPERATION Upon actuation of the P/B, the time-controlled solenoid valve
of the associated side releases out fluid to the spray nozzle for a
preset period of time. To initiate a new cycle, it is necessary to
release, then to press the P/B again. Between each cycle, the lines are
automatically and permanently purged by hot air. The pressure indication
shows the nitrogen pressure in the bottle. When the needle is in the
yellow range, or the can is completely empty, the bottle should be
replaced.

SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL
TEST
The wastewater from the galley and lavatory compartment washbasins is
dumped overboard through drain masts.
To perform a complete test of the drain mast system, two tests must be
carried out, one from the MCDU, and the second one on each CU. If the
test is satisfactory: - on the MCDU, the message "TEST OK" is
displayed, - on the front face of the CU, the HTR and CU lights are ON
as long as the associated TEST P/BSW is pressed in. If we have a fault
on that system, the information is indicated by a CAUT light on the FAP
and can be seen on the SYSTEM INFO, on page: "DRAINMASTS FAIL\> - CHECK
WASTE WATER OVERFLOW FWD (AFT)".
CONTROL SUPPLY To protect drain masts against ice formation, electrical
heating, through an automatically controlled system, is supplied when
the A/C is electrically supplied.
USERS The flexible heater foil, bonded on the drain mast tube, is
temperature regulated via a sensor and powered by the drain mast heating
Control Unit (CU). The AC power supply line, within the drain mast, is
installed with a thermal switch opening at 120°C (250°F). It will
regulate the temperature in case of normal temperature control failure.
CONTROL UNIT The CU regulates the temperature of the drain mast tube.
The correct operation of the system is monitored by the BITE function of
the CU. Each CU regulates the heating temperature of the associated
drain mast tube between 6°C (43°F) and 10°C (50°F).
MONITORING The system status is sent to the Cabin Intercommunication
Data System (CIDS) for indication on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP).
The failure of the Heater (HTR) or CU is indicated on the FAP by a CIDS
CAUTion light, and on the front face of the CU by HTR and CU lights. The
drain mast data is stored in the Centralized Fault Display Interface
Unit (CFDIU).

DUAL ADVISORY ICE DETECTION DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) FUNCTION
RESET
The purpose of the dual advisory ice detection system is to supply: - A
better detection of icing conditions, - Fuel saving by cutting off the
hot air bleed for the anti-ice systems when the latter are no longer
necessary. The dual advisory ice detection system is made of two ice
detectors installed on the aircraft skin and directly connected to the
Flight Warning Computer (FWC) to send warning messages to the crew on
the Engine/Warning Display (EWD).
When wing anti-ice valves are controlled to open, two ground signals are
sent to the ice detectors in order to reset the ice detection counter
and cut off the "SEVERE" signal.
DETECTION Two levels of detection are given: - "ICE DETECTED"
corresponding to an elementary detection, - "SEVERE ICE DETECTED"
corresponding to 7 successive elementary detections. The ice detection
system is operating at electrical power-up. It sends warning messages
when the aircraft is in flight, depending on the altitude and when Total
Air Temperature (TAT) is below 8°C (46.4°F), even with one ice detector
faulty.
MONITORING Each ice detector is installed with a BITE function for
continuous monitoring. Each ice detector sends a "FAULT" signal to
System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) 1 and 2 and to the
Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) in case of failure
during either power-up, MCDU or in operation tests. A class 2 fault
message is displayed on the MCDU ANTI-ICE ICE DETECTOR 1 or 2 system
page in case of ice detector failure.
FWC MESSAGES The ice detectors generate three different discrete
signals: - "ICE DETECTED" signal when engine air intake anti-ice is
necessary, - "SEVERE ICE DETECTED" signal when wing anti-ice is
necessary, - "ICE DETECT FAULT" signal when the two ice detectors are
faulty. This displays class 1 warning messages on the EWD. These
messages can be respectively inhibited by engine or wing anti-ice
selection.

ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS
When the aircraft is parked, it is recommended to install protective
covers on the air data probes (static ports, pitot probes, AOA probes,
TAT probes). The protective covers help protect the probes from
contamination. The covers should be marked with REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT.
Ground personnel must insure that the covers are removed before flight
or before power is applied to the probes (engine start or ground test).
The probe heat system operates automatically to power the air data probe
heaters when at least one engine is running. It is also designed to
operate automatically when the aircraft is in flight. During the
troubleshooting and the on ground operations, observe the following
precautions: - if the Probe Heat Computer (PHC) power supply C/B is
pulled, the PHC internal relay will relax and the related probes will be
heated. Make sure to pull ALL of the associated probe heat C/B's (Static
supply (28VDC), AOA supply, Pitot supply & TAT supply (all 115 VAC)). -
if the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply C/B is pulled, the PHC
will sense an "engine running" condition and the probes will be heated.
Make sure to pull ALL of the probe heat C/B's (Static supply (28VDC),
AOA supply, Pitot supply & TAT supply (all 115 VAC)). - if the C/B of
the LGCIU is pulled, it simulates FLIGHT situation. So the probe heating
is also switched ON.
