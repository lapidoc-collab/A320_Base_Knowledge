CONDITIONED SERVICE AIR SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The Fuel Tank Inerting
System (FTIS) includes two sub-systems: - The Conditioned Service Air
System (CSAS), - The Inert Gas Generation System (IGGS). The CSAS gets
hot air from the Engine bleed air system and decreases its temperature
to a level compatible with the IGGS sub-system. The CSAS includes: - The
Conditioned service air system Controller Unit (CCU), which does the
system control and health monitoring BITE and has interfaces with the
FWS and CFDS, - A CSAS isolation valve, which is a protection of the
system if there is low pressure, over pressure or over temperature, - A
heat exchanger to decrease the air temperature.

CONDITIONED SERVICE AIR SYSTEM D/O (3) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Engine 1 is
the primary bleed source and Eng 2, through the X Bleed valve, is the
secondary bleed source. APU or Ground Cart supply can be used for
interactive test on Ground. The CSAS gets bleed air from the Engine
Bleed Air System and does its conditioning for the IGGS. First, the
ozone converter decreases the quantity of ozone in the bleed air to give
protection to the IGGS components. Then, the air temperature is
decreased by the CSAS heat exchanger to get a temperature of 60°C+/-6°C.
TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE CONTROL The bypass valve is installed in the
heat exchanger bypass duct and is controlled by the CSAS. The bypass
valve adds hot air downstream of the heat exchanger to maintain the
temperature within limits. On the output duct, a dual element
temperature sensor and a pressure sensor monitor the temperature and the
pressure before they go into the IGGS. If there is over-pressure or
over-temperature, the CSAS isolation valve closes to stop the system.

CSAS OPERATION The system is installed on the left hand side of the
aircraft belly fairing. The bleed air is pulled from the High Pressure
Ground Connector (HPGC) tube. In normal operation, the CSAS isolation
valve is open to let the air go through the ozone converter. After the
Ozone converter, the air temperature is decreased by the CSAS heat
exchanger. The output of the heat exchanger is connected to the IGGS.

CONDITIONED SERVICE AIR SYSTEM D/O (3) CSAS INTERFACES The CSAS
controller is installed in the FWD electronics rack (90VU) in the
avionics compartment. It does the system control and health monitoring
BITE and has interfaces with the Flight Warning System (FWS) and the
maintenance computer. If a failure of the CSAS system occurs, the status
message "INERT FAULT" will come into view only in flight phase 1 and 10,
for maintenance. NOTE: The MEL tells that the A/C can be dispatched with
the system unserviceable for 10 days with no maintenance procedure. The
CSAS Controller is interconnected between Air Conditioning System
Controller (ACSC) and Engine Interface Units (EIUs) to keep a minimum
bleed pressure during descent.

INERT GAS GENERATION SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The Fuel Tank Inerting
System (FTIS) includes two sub-systems: - The Conditioned Service Air
System (CSAS), - The Inert Gas Generation System (IGGS). The IGGS uses
an Air Separation Module (ASM) to remove oxygen from the conditioned air
stream. This makes and separates the Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA) and the
Oxygen Enriched Air (OEA). The OEA is sent overboard. The Dual Flow Shut
Off Valve (DFSOV) controls the NEA flow to the center fuel tank, lets
the system change between low/middle/high NEA flow and isolates the IGGS
from the center fuel tank. The IGGS controller supplies system control
and health monitoring/BITE. The IGGS isolation valve is a solenoid
valve. It is spring-loaded closed. During operation, the IGGS Controller
Unit (ICU) controls the valve to open, to let conditioned air from CSAS
to the IGGS. It closes if too low a pressure and/or overtemperature air
come from the heat exchanger.

INERT GAS GENERATION SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL (continued) SAFETY
PRECAUTION The FTIS supplies NEA, which is a gas with a low oxygen
content and can cause an asphyxiation risk to the personnel if this gas
is in confined spaces.

INERT GAS GENERATION SYSTEM D/O (3) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION To inert the
center fuel tank and to control and monitor the IGGS, the IGGS
includes: - one IGGS Isolation Gate Valve, - one D-ULPA (Double ultra
low particle) filter, - one temperature sensor, - two pressure
transmitters (inlet and outlet of the ASM), - one oxygen sensor at the
outlet of the ASM, - one Air Separation Module (ASM), - one Dual Flow
Shut Off Valve (DFSOV), - one dual flapper check valve, - one IGGS
Controller Unit (ICU).
SYSTEM OPERATION NORMAL OPERATION The bleed air comes from the CSAS and
it is filtered by the D-ULPA filter to keep the ASM inlet clean, without
hydrocarbons and dust. Downstream of the D-ULPA filter, one temperature
sensor and one pressure sensor send air parameters to the ICU. The ASM,
which is the core of the IGGS, removes oxygen and sends NEA to the
center fuel tank. The OEA is sent overboard through an outlet on the
HPGC door. Downstream of the ASM, an oxygen sensor measures the oxygen
rate to prevent a high oxygen concentration in the center fuel tank. The
oxygen sensor has a pressure sensing capability when it is energized and
thus it prevents over-pressure in the center fuel tank. The DFSOV
controls the NEA flow to the center fuel tank and lets the system change
between low/mid/high NEA flow in relation to the flight phases. The
DFSOV also isolates the IGGS from the center fuel tank if an abnormal
operation occurs. A Dual Flapper Check Valve makes a double barrier to
the possible back-flow of fuel.

ABNORMAL OPERATION If there is overpressure or overtemperature, the ICU
de-energizes the IGGS Isolation Gate Valve solenoid to close the IGGS
Isolation Gate Valve. If the oxygen sensor senses an oxygen rate higher
than 12%, the ICU de-energizes the IGGS Isolation Gate Valve solenoid
and the DFSOV solenoid to close the IGGS Isolation Gate Valve and the
DFSOV.

MODULE (ASM) The ASM is the core of the Inert Gas Generation System. It
removes oxygen from the compressed air stream. It makes Nitrogen
Enriched Air (NEA) and Oxygen Enriched Air (OEA). The NEA is sent to the
center fuel tank and the OEA is sent overboard. An ASM is a
semi-permeable hollow-fiber membrane bundle contained in a pressure
containment canister.

DUAL FLAPPER CHECK VALVE NEA is supplied from the IGGS to the center
fuel tank by the distribution pipe and nozzle. A twin check valve system
prevents fuel ingress from the center fuel tank back to the IGGS. The
system is contained in one housing that includes two in-line flapper
type check valves (Dual flapper check valve). These valves are on the
outer side of the center fuel tank.

INERT GAS GENERATION SYSTEM D/O (3) ICU INTERFACES The ADIRU 1 supplies
Standard Altitude, True Airspeed, Total Air Temperature and Altitude
Rate signals to the ICU. The CCU makes the communication possible
between the IGGS controller, the CFDIU and the FWS. The communication
between the two controllers is also used to give the condition of each
system. For example, if the CSAS stops because of an overtemperature
scenario, the CCU will tell the ICU that the system is closed and they
will compare the readings of the sensors that come from the two systems.
