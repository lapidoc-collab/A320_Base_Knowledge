PRESENTATION (1) **ENGINE FIRE PROTECTION**
The engine fire protection is done by two sub-systems: the FIRE
detection system and the FIRE extinguishing system.
**DETECTION AND EXTINGUISHING**
The engines have individual fire detection systems.
Each system has two identical detection loops (A and B) installed in
parallel. Each loop is has 3 detector elements.
The two loops are monitored by a Fire Detection Unit (FDU). FDU
1 monitors the loops on engine 1 and FDU 2 monitors the loops on engine
2.
The FDU sends FIRE and FAULT signals to the Flight Warning Computer
(FWC) for display on the ECAM.
The guarded FIRE P/B switches give FIRE indication and are used to
isolate the affected systems. When the FIRE P/B is released out, fuel
supply, hydraulic supply, electrical power and bleed supply are cut off.
This also arms the extinguishing system.
Each bottle is discharged by a related AGENT P/B switch. The P/B
switches are on the overhead FIRE panel.
The TEST buttons are used to do a test the related fire detection and
extinguishing system operation.

**ENGINE AND PYLON FIRE**
**DETECTORS**
The Engine and Pylon Fire Detectors are shown below. The principles of
operation are the same for both CEO and NEO aircraft. The detectors are
still dual loop elements.
The locations however are different on the CFM LEAP-1A engine:
\-
1 core detector element on the turbine case
\-
1 main engine gearbox detector
\-
1 pylon detector
\-
1 at the ventilation exit of the Fan Case EFFECTIVITY: A319/A320/A321

PRESENTATION (1) **APU FIRE PROTECTION**
The APU fire protection is done by two sub-systems: the FIRE detection
system and the FIRE extinguishing system.
**DETECTION AND EXTINGUISHING**
The detection system has two identical detection loops (A and B) mounted
in parallel. Each loop has a single detector element. Both loops are
monitored by a FDU. The FDU sends FIRE and FAULT
signals to the FWC for display on ECAM.
The guarded FIRE P/B switches give a FIRE indication and the means to
isolate affected systems. When the FIRE P/B is released out, fuel,
electrical power and bleed supply are cut off and the APU is immediately
shut down. This also arms the extinguishing system.
For the APU, there is just one fire extinguisher bottle. It is
discharged by a single AGENT P/B switch. On the ground, an APU FIRE will
trigger an APU automatic shutdown and discharge the bottle
automatically.
The TEST button is used to test the fire detection and extinguishing
system operation.

PRESENTATION (1) **APU FIRE PROTECTION (continued)**
**CONTROL AND INDICATING**
The detection and extinguishing functions are done from the overhead
FIRE panel.
If an APU FIRE is detected on the ground, an auto-extinguishing system
will automatically stop the APU and discharge the fire bottle into the
APU compartment. A test of the auto-extinguishing system can be done
from the maintenance test panel, on the overhead panel.
If an APU FIRE occurs on the ground, ground personnel are alerted by a
warning horn in the nose wheel well and an APU FIRE indicator light on
the external power panel on the lower fuselage.
