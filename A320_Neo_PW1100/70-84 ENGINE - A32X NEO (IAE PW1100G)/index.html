PRESENTATION (1) <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
The PW1100G engine is an axial flow, dual-rotor, geared fan, variable
stator, ultra high bypass ratio power plant. The PW1100G engines power
the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft of the Single Aisle New Engine Option
(NEO) family. PW1100G engines are available in several thrust ratings.
The geared turbo fan engine reduces fuel consumption, air pollution and
noise.
Each engine comes with a Data Storage Unit (DSU) which is connected onto
the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). It provides engine parameters, thus
the possibility of changing the thrust rating.

PRESENTATION (1) <strong>MODULAR CONCEPT (continued)</strong>
<strong>LP ROTOR, HP ROTOR AND COMBUSTION CHAMBER</strong>
The Low Pressure (LP) rotor comprises a fan driven by the FDGS, the Low
Pressure compressor and the LP shaft, all driven by the LP
turbine. The speed of the LP rotor is indicated on the ECAM as N1.
The fan supplies most of the engine thrust. The air produced by the fan
is known as secondary airflow or bypass airflow.
To improve the propulsive efficiency and fuel consumption, the FDGS
reduces the fan speed thanks to reduction gear mechanism.
The 3-stage Low Pressure (LP) compressor supplies air to the engine
core. This is primary airflow. The LP compressor rotates at the same
speed as the 3 stage LP turbine.
The High Pressure (HP) rotor is made up of 8 stage HP compressor driven
by two stage HP turbine. The speed of the HP rotor is indicated on the
ECAM as N2.
The LP and the HP rotors are supported by roller and ball bearings which
are lubricated and cooled.
The annular combustion chamber is installed between the HP
compressor and HP turbine.
It has ports for 18 fuel nozzles and 2 igniter plugs.

<strong>TRANSFER &amp; ACCESSORY GEARBOXES</strong>
The accessory gearbox is installed under the core engine and is driven
by the HP rotor through the Angle gearbox.
The fuel pumps, oil pumps, hydraulic pump, Integrated Drive Generator
(IDG) and FADEC alternator are all driven by the gearbox.
During engine starting, the air turbine starter rotates the HP
compressor through the gearboxes.

PRESENTATION (1) <strong>PROPULSION CONTROL SYSTEM (PCS)</strong>
The Propulsion Control System (PCS) regroups the following subsystems:
- The FADEC system consists of an Electronic Engine Control (EEC) and a
Prognostic Health Monitoring Unit (PHMU),
- The Engine Interface Unit (EIU).
In order to increase engine reliability and efficiency, the FADEC gives
the full range of engine control to achieve steady state and transient
engine performances when operated in combination with aircraft
subsystems.
The EEC controls the operation of the following:
- Engine control for thrust setting in Manual and Auto thrust Modes,
- Thrust Control Malfunction protection,
- Engine airflow control,
- Combustor fuel metering valve,
- Control and monitoring sensing,
- Ignition and starting systems,
- Command and monitoring of the thrust reverser system,
- Fault detection, isolation, annunciation and transmission to the A/C
(BITE).
When the engine is running, power for FADEC operation is supplied by a
dedicated alternator driven by the gearbox.
The PHMU interfaces with the EEC. It monitors the Engine vibrations and
the Oil debris.

PRESENTATION (1) <strong>EIU</strong>
The EIU is an interface concentrator between the airframe and the
corresponding engine. Two EIUs are installed in the A/C. EIU-1
interfaces with Engine 1 and EIU-2 interfaces with Engine 2.
The main functions of the EIU are:
- To concentrate data from cockpit panels and different aircraft
systems to the associated EEC on each engine,
- To ensure the segregation of the two engines,
- To give to the airframe the necessary logic and information from
engine and to other systems (APU, ECS, Bleed Air, Maintenance),
- To give to the FADEC system some necessary logic and information from
systems (example: flight/ground status).
The Fan Cowl latches of the A320 NEO are monitored by proximity switches
which send their position signals to the EIU.
The EIU transfers signals to the FWC for associated cockpit warnings
based on specific logic conditions.

PRESENTATION (1) <strong>CONTROL AND INDICATING</strong>
This section will highlight the control panels and indications for the
engines.
<strong>CONTROL PANELS</strong>
The engines are controlled by throttle control levers which are
installed on the center pedestal. They can only be moved manually.
For reverse thrust operation, two latching levers let the throttle
control levers move rearward into the reverse thrust section.
The A320 family aircraft normally operate in the auto thrust mode, when
in flight.
The autothrust can be disconnected with an instinctive disconnect
pushbutton (2 red buttons are installed on the outside of the lever).
This lets the engines be controlled in manual thrust mode.
The controls for engine starting and shutdown are installed on the
center pedestal immediately behind the throttle control levers.
The engine MAN START switches are installed on the overhead panel. These
switches are used to start an engine during a manual start procedure.
They are also used during a dry or wet motoring procedure.

PRESENTATION (1) <strong>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</strong>
When you work on aircraft, make sure that you obey all the Aircraft
Maintenance Manual (AMM) safety procedures.
This will prevent injury to persons and/or damage to the aircraft. Here
is an overview of main safety precautions related to the engines.
Make sure that all engine danger areas are as clear as possible to
prevent damage to the engine, the aircraft or persons in the area.
Be careful: The entry corridor will be closed when the engine power is
above the minimum.
Make sure that you have fire-fighting equipment available.
Do not try to stop the fan from turning by hand.
After engine shutdown, let the oil tank pressure bleed off for a minimum
of 5 minutes before you remove the tank filler cap. If you do not,
pressurized oil can flow out of the tank and cause dangerous burns.
The engine ignition system is an electrical system with high energy. You
must be careful to prevent electrical shock. Injury or death can occur.
Do not do maintenance on the ignition system while the engine operates.
Make sure that the engine shutdown occurred more than 5 minutes ago
before you continue with the maintenance procedure.
Make sure that the thrust reverser is deactivated during maintenance. If
not, the thrust reverser can operate accidentally and cause injury to
personnel and/or damage to the reverser.
When opening the engine cowls:
o Respect the wind limitations and the opening/closing sequence, o
Always secure cowls with the hold-open rods, o Make sure that the slats
are retracted and install a warning notice to prevent slat operation.

LOCATION (2) <strong>SYSTEM OVERVIEW</strong>
The PW1100G engine is an axial flow, dual-rotor, geared fan, variable
stator, ultra high bypass ratio power plant.
The PW1100G engines power the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft of the A320
NEO family. PW1100G engines are available in several thrust ratings.
The geared turbo fan engine provides improved fuel efficiency and
reduces engine noise. It also reduces the CO2 and NOx emissions.
All the engines are basically the same. The Data Storage Unit (DSU) on
the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) provides the possibility of changing
the thrust rating.
The power plant installation includes the engine, the engine inlet, the
exhaust, the fan cowls and the reverser assemblies. The pylon connects
the engine to the wing structure. The engine is attached to the pylon by
FWD and AFT mounts.

<strong>AIR INTAKE FUNCTIONS</strong>
The main function of the inlet cowl is to guide the airflow into the
engine inlet and to permit an aerodynamic airflow over the outer surface
of the engine.
When the engine anti icing is selected to ON from the cockpit overhead
panel, hot bleed air from the engine is ducted to the cowl nose lip to
prevent ice build-up. The hot air enters to the inlet lip through a
dedicated duct at the 4 o\' clock position in the outer bulkhead. The
air then exhausts overboard through a flush exit ports at the 6 o\'
clock position in the outer barrel.
The outer barrel has an impregnated copper screen layer for protection
against lightning strike.

<strong>HEAT EXCHANGERS AND FUEL RETURN TO TANK</strong>
The boost pump sends LP fuel from the engine fuel supply line to the IDG
FOHE. Fuel flow is used to cool down the IDG oil through the IDG
FOHE and the engine oil through the engine FOHE. In turn, fuel is heated
and de-iced.
Fuel from the engine FOHE is then sent to the fuel filter.
The Fuel Return-To-Tank (FRTT) module contains the Fuel Return Valve
(FRV) and the FRTT Temperature sensor.
The FRV controls fuel to flow back to the aircraft tanks from downstream
of the IDG FOHE and before it enters the engine FOHE as part of the fuel
heat management system. The FRV is controlled by the Electronic Engine
Control (EEC) depending on the fuel temperature.

<strong>INTEGRATED FUEL PUMP AND CONTROL</strong>
The IFPC is an electronically controlled unit which integrates the fuel
metering components and the fuel pumps in a single unit to limit the
space and the number of external tubes required for the system. The IFPC
uses dual coil torque motors and solenoids to control hydro-mechanical
valves in relation to the fuel flow. The Main Gearbox (MGB) turns the
IFPC input shaft which drives the fuel pump boost-stage, the main fuel
pump and servo pump.
<strong>FUEL FILTER AND MAIN PUMP</strong>
The heated fuel from the engine FOHE is directed through the fuel
filter. The filter element is a disposable filter located in a housing
attached on the fuel manifold. The filter is monitored by a differential
pressure transmitter. The filter housing is fitted with a bypass valve
in case of filter element clogging. The filter element is a disposable
25 micron filter.
The fuel exits the fuel filter and flows to the inlet port of the main
fuel pump. The main fuel pump is a single-stage gear pump, which
increases the fuel pressure and sends the pressurized fuel to the Fuel
Metering Valve (FMV).

<strong>INTEGRATED FUEL PUMP AND CONTROL (continued)</strong> <strong>PRESSURE REGULATING
VALVE AND BYPASS</strong>
<strong>DIRECTIONAL CONTROL VALVE</strong>
Inside the IFPC, the fuel from the main pump is directed to the FMV
and to the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV). The purpose of the PRV
is to maintain a constant fuel pressure drop across the FMV to ensure
the correct fuel flow and acceleration for the engine.
The TCM/Overspeed TM controls the fuel pressure to the back side of the
PRV to modulate fuel flow between the FMV and the Bypass Directional
Control Valve (BDCV).
Pressurized fuel that passes through the PRV is directed to the BDCV.
The BDCV directs fuel by-passed by the PRV to the engine FOHE
at low engine power or when the fuel temperature is low to help in
maintaining the engine oil and fuel within operating limits.
At high power, the BDCV returns the recirculation flow downstream of the
FOHE.

<strong>FUEL FLOW TRANSMITTER, FLOW DIVIDER VALVE</strong>
<strong>AND FUEL NOZZLES</strong>
The metered fuel from the FMV crosses the HPSOV and flows to the fuel
flow transmitter.
The fuel flow transmitter sends the fuel flow rate to the EEC channel A
and directs fuel to the Flow Divider Valve (FDV).
The EEC commands the FDV opening during starting to improve fuel
atomization.
During engine start, the FDV sends most of fuel to the primary manifold.
Above idle, the FDV evenly divides metered fuel flow between the primary
and secondary fuel manifolds.
At shutdown, the FDV is spring loaded closed to allow primary and
secondary manifold drainage.
The FDV is fitted with a metal screen strainer that can be bypassed in
case of blockage.
There are 18 fuel nozzles mounted to the outer diffuser case. All the
nozzles atomize fuel inside the combustor.
Twelve of them are duplex nozzles featuring both a primary and a
secondary fuel flow paths while six others are simplex nozzles providing
only a secondary fuel flow path.

<strong>SERVO FUEL AND SERVO MINIMUM PRESSURE AND</strong>
<strong>PUMP SHARING VALVE</strong>
The servo pump housed in the IFPC is a gear-stage pump which sends
pressurized fuel to a wash filter. Fine filtered, pressurized fuel from
the wash filter is supplied to the engine air system actuators where it
is used as servo and muscle pressure to position the actuator pistons.
These actuators are:
- the Low Pressure Compressor (LPC) Stator Vane Actuator (SVA),
- the LPC (2.5) Bleed Valve Actuator (BVA),
- the turbine Active Case Cooling (ACC) valve,
- and the High-Pressure Compressor (HPC) SVAs (primary and secondary).
The fuel from the actuators is filtered again before it returns back to
main pump and servo pump inlet.
The Servo Minimum Pressure and Pump Sharing Valve is a spring loaded
valve that provides the five air system actuators with main pump fuel
pressure when servo pump fuel pressure is not enough during start.

<strong>ECOLOGY SYSTEM</strong>
At engine shutdown, residual fuel in the manifolds downstream of the FDV
is drained back through the FDV to an ecology collector tank.
The collected fuel remains in the ecology collector tank until the next
engine start when the fuel is drawn back into the fuel system.
During shutdown, the fuel pressure from the IFPC is reduced and the FDV
closes to prevent fuel from entering the combustor and to drain any fuel
remaining in both the primary and secondary fuel lines to the ecology
collector tank.
The ecology collector tank has enough space to receive fuel from a
single engine shutdown. The tank has an inlet float valve which closes
when the tank has reached its maximum capacity. This prevents the tank
from overfilling and spilling fuel out following an aborted start.
At next engine start up, the ejector pump draws the fuel from the
ecology collector tank back to the IFPC boost pump. The tank has an
outlet float valve which closes when the tank has reached its minimum
capacity and a check valve to avoid fuel transfer from the suction line.

<strong>STARTING</strong>
<strong>INITIATION</strong>
During starting, the servo pump fuel pressure is not enough to control
the air system actuators and to close the Servo Minimum Pressure and
Pump Sharing Valve. In this position, the Servo Minimum Pressure and
Pump Sharing Valve directs a portion of pressurized fuel from the main
pump to the five actuators. The other portion of fuel from the main pump
is sent to the PRV and to the FMV. The PRV
opens partly and directs the excess of fuel flow to the BDCV which is
spring loaded to send it to the engine FOHE.
The EEC opens the FMV and let the fuel to flow to the HPSOV which also
opens and sends fuel to the fuel flow transmitter.
The pressurized fuel opens the FDV. The FDV partly opens and sends most
of fuel to the primary fuel nozzles.

<strong>STARTING (continued)</strong>
<strong>ACCELERATION</strong>
As the pumps rotation speed increases with the engine acceleration, the
fuel pressure also increases. The FMV opens more and as a consequence
the fuel pressure pushes the BDCV out of its rest position to direct the
excess fuel flow to the fuel filter.
The FDV also opens more and evenly divides metered fuel flow between the
primary and secondary fuel nozzles.
In parallel, the fuel pressure from the servo pump increases and pushes
the Servo Minimum Pressure and Pump Sharing Valve, segregating the burn
flow from the servo fuel.

open to bypass the main pump fuel flow away from the FMV to the FOHE.
In turn when the related fuel pressure drops, the FDV closes to let the
remaining fuel in the nozzle manifolds to drain in the ecology drain
tank, and the Servo Minimum Pressure and Pump Sharing Valve reopens.
After the HPSOV is confirmed closed by the proximity switches, the EEC
tests the FMV via its TM then closes it.

<strong>SHUTDOWN (continued)</strong>
<strong>ABNORMAL SHUTDOWN</strong>
The abnormal shutdown is initiated in case of an overspeed (N1 or N2),
shaft shear (fan, LP or HP) or Thrust Control Malfunction (TCM) event
detected on ground.
In such case, the TCM/overspeed TM directs fuel pressure to the back
side of the HPSOV and of the PRV. This causes the PRV to open and stop
fuel flow to the FMV, allowing rapid closure of the HPSOV and rapid
engine shutdown.
Fuel flow through the PRV is directed to the BDCV and then to the engine
FOHE.
This shutoff method is independent from the FMV control.

<strong>FUEL INDICATING</strong>
The engine fuel indicating monitors the system condition and provides
the system status to the cockpit displays.
The fuel flow transmitter sends signals to the EEC which enables the
calculation of the fuel flow to the combustor.
The fuel flow is a primary engine parameter and is displayed on the EWD
permanently. The EEC also sends this data for the fuel used computation
and display on the System Display (SD).
The Fuel Filter Differential Pressure (FFDP) sensor measures the
differential pressure across the fuel filter.
This helps to detect if the filter is partially or totally clogged.
According to the received value, the EEC will generate various warnings
on the EWD: ENG X FUEL FILTER DEGRAD or ENG X FUEL
FILTER CLOG or ENG X FUEL SENSOR FAULT and on the SD: CLOG.
The IDG Fuel-Oil Heat Exchanger (FOHE) differential pressure sensor is
used to sense the differential pressure on the fuel side of the FOHE
and send a signal to the EEC in case of clogging detection. According to
the status, the EEC will generate various warnings on the EWD: ENG X
HEAT EXCHANGR CLOG or ENG X FUEL SENSOR FAULT.
For monitoring and Thermal Management System control by the EEC, the
fuel temperature is sensed by two dual channel temperature sensors.
The fuel temperature sensor is used for the control of the heat
exchangers (Fuel/Oil Heat Exchanger Bypass Valve (FOHEBV)) and BDCV.
The Fuel Return To Tank (FRTT) temperature sensor is used for the RTTV
control.
The engine fuel temperature is not directly displayed in the cockpit
but, according to the status, the EEC will generate various warnings on
the EWD: ENG X HOT FUEL or ENG X FUEL HEAT SYS or ENG X
HEAT SYS DEGRADED or ENG X HEAT SYS FAULT.

The FADEC provides automatic engine thrust control and thrust parameter
limit computation.
The EEC uses air data parameters from Air Data/Inertial Reference System
(ADIRS) for rating calculations.
The FADEC manages power according to two thrust modes:
- manual mode depending on Throttle Lever Angle (TLA),
- autothrust mode depending on autothrust function generated by the
Auto Flight System (AFS).
The FADEC also provides two idle mode selections: minimum idle and
approach idle.
If the aircraft is on ground and extend the slats the engine will stay
at minimum idle but in flight it will go to approach idle. The idle can
also be modulated up to approach idle depending on: Air conditioning
demand, wing anti-ice demand, engine anti-ice demand and oil temperature
(for Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) cooling).

selected input sensors and output drivers.
In addition to input/output redundancy (for comparison and backup), data
is sent internally between the two channels by a crosstalk data link.
Each channel receives inputs from the A/C and FADEC system sources.
Thus, each channel can monitor and control the operation of the engine
and transmit engine data to the A/C and to engine subsystem duplicated
controls (torque motors and solenoids).
EEC channels A and B are housed in one assembly but are physically
divided by a two-piece modular design. Each channel module has one
printed circuit board module, the input/output interconnect modules and
one pressure sensor.
Five electrical connectors are used in each channel module to connect
wiring from the engine, aircraft and nacelle.
The EEC also has a connector to test the unit and a connector for the
Data Storage Unit (DSU).
<strong>DSU</strong>
The DSU is a data memory plug attached to the engine case bracket by a
lanyard and connected on the EEC channel A for engine identification and
rating, engine trim data storage and detected failures storage.

<strong>PROCESS</strong>
Most of the FADEC operations are based on the same principle, they
respond to a demand from the A/C or from the EEC internal schedules, and
they take into account input parameters from the A/C and from the engine
sensors. Most of the sensors and output drivers are duplicated for
redundancy and segregated to each EEC channel.
For a control loop, one EEC channel elaborates a single command signal
sent to an engine subsystem control and it makes sure that its command
has been followed by monitoring the dual feedback from this engine
subsystem. The EEC also continuously performs integrity test of its
control circuits.
When fully operational, the EEC starts and operates in an Active-Standby
mode. Under this control scheme, only one channel of the EEC has full
authority over all engine functions and is identified as the preferred
channel. The preferred channel is alternated upon every engine shutdown
for the next engine start.
If a feedback fault is detected in the preferred channel, the data is
retrieved from the standby channel via the crosstalk data link.
If an output driver fault is detected, the EEC switches from
Active-Standby mode to Active-Active mode. This allows either channel to
control any of the output drivers independently, regardless of which
channel is the preferred channel.
This control mode allows both channels to be engaged simultaneously and
to manage different engine functions, providing an effective fault
accommodation strategy. If the crosstalk data link is lost, each channel
maintains its current controls prior the failure.
If the engine subsystem control loop is no more possible (by any
channel), the subsystem control is set to its failsafe position.

<strong>GENERAL</strong>
The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) controls and monitors the Starting
and Ignition systems for engine starting, cranking, and ignition
selection, on ground and in flight.
For engine starting, two modes are available; automatic or manual.
Both modes can be used on ground or in flight but in flight sequence are
less protective to enhance the restart capability.
For engine cranking, two sequences can be manually selected: dry or wet.
The EEC controls the starting and ignition components according to
cockpit commands and protective logics.
The main engine parameters to be monitored during starting are displays
on the E/WD (N1, EGT, N2, Fuel Flow) and on the SD (Oil Press, IGN
system, Starter Air Valve position and available pneumatic pressure).
The ignition system is composed of a dual channel ignition exciter
supplying two spark igniter plugs.
Each plug and corresponding circuit (identified as system A and system
B) can be used at the same time or alternately to detect dormant
failures.
The EEC controls the ignition by providing command signals to the
internal relays of the ignition exciter, whereas the EIU supplies 115
Volt power supply to the ignition exciter.
The starting system consists of a Starter Air Valve (SAV), air duct and
an Air Turbine Starter (ATS).
The SAV is electrically controlled by the EEC and pneumatically
operated.
The ATS is attached to the aft of the main gearbox at the 5 o\'clock
position. It is fitted with a speed sensor which is used for system
control and monitoring by the EEC.
The pressurized air supply to the starting components is provided by one
of the following sources:
- Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) bleed,
- external pneumatic ground cart,

- SAV closure,
<strong>MANUAL START</strong>
- igniters off,
- FMV and HP fuel shut-off valve closure.
A manual engine start procedure is included in the EEC engine starting
logic.
In the manual start mode, engine starting control is under limited
authority of the EEC.
The SAV, fuel, and ignition are controlled from the cockpit via the EEC.
Bleed air source being available, a manual start sequence is commanded
by first setting the rotary selector to the IGN/START position to power
and signal the EEC.
The ENGINE page appears on the SD page of the ECAM.
The ENGINE page displays the IGN indication, SAV position and bleed
pressure during this sequence.
At the same time, the APU bleed demand will increase and the pack valves
will close.
The next action is to engage the ENG MAN START push-button to the ON
position. This will lead the EEC to open the SAV.
When N2 is above the minimum fuel pressurization speed (on-ground
approximately 18% N2), the ENG MASTER lever is set to the ON
position. The EEC commands fuel flow and both igniters simultaneously.
The EEC monitors the EGT and N2 according to their schedules to provide
the correct fuel flow but EGT limit protection is inactive.
When N2 reaches 51% N2, the manual start sequence automatically ends
when the EEC controls the SAV to close and the igniters to OFF.
The engine continues to accelerate and stabilizes at idle speed.
Manual start abort:
When a manual engine start has been initiated on ground or in flight, it
shall be interrupted by either:
- de-selecting the ENG MAN START push-button before the ENG
MASTER lever is commanded ON, or
- selecting ENG MASTER lever back to OFF position after it has already
been selected ON.
Interruption of a manual start shall result in the following EEC

D/O (ME) (3) <strong>CONTINUOUS IGNITION</strong>
Continuous ignition is manually selected or automatically controlled by
the FADEC.
During continuous ignition both igniters are active.
Manual command:
Once the engine is running and above idle, the pilot can manually
command continuous ignition at any time by moving the rotary selector to
the IGN/START position.
Following a ground start, the rotary selector must be moved back to NORM
before continuous ignition can be manually selected by moving it back to
IGN/START position.
Continuous ignition shall remain commanded by the EEC until the rotary
selector is moved back to NORM.
In the event that data position of the rotary selector sent by Engine
Interface Unit (EIU) to EEC is not available or invalid, the EEC shall
use the last valid value of the rotary selector position if the aircraft
is on ground until a valid configuration is received again.
Automatic command:
The EEC automatically commands continuous ignition at the following
conditions:
- If an engine flameout is detected in flight, or during takeoff,
igniters are kept on for a minimum of 30 seconds after the engine has
recovered from the flameout and reached idle,
- If a surge is detected in flight or during takeoff, igniters are
powered until 30 seconds after the surge recovers,
- If the EEC detects a quick relight (Master Lever cycled from ON to
OFF and back to ON in flight),
- If TCM Cutback is commanded.
Automatic continuous ignition shall be inhibited if the burner pressure
(PB) is above 150 psi (the nominal deteriorated igniter quench point) to
preserve igniter life.

D/O (ME) (3) <strong>ENGINE CRANK</strong>
<strong>DRY CRANK</strong>
Cranking function is used to motor the engine on the ground for a short
time with the use of the starter.
There are two cranking modes:
- dry cranking,
- wet cranking.
The dry cranking procedure is used to motor the engine to remove
unburned fuel from the combustion chamber or cool down the engine or for
some fuel or oil leak tests.
The EEC shall enter the engine dry crank sequence when all of the
following conditions are true:
- the engine is not running and,
- the aircraft is on ground and,
- the rotary selector is set to CRANK.
This will power up the EEC and isolate both ignition systems.
The ENGINE page appears automatically on the ECAM SD.
When the ENG MAN START P/B is set to ON, the EEC commands the SAV to
open.
The dry motoring can be interrupted at any time by pushing the ENG
MAN START pushbutton to OFF or positioning the ENG MODE
rotary selector to NORM position.
The usual starter duty cycle is 3 starter crank cycles or 4 minutes
maximum of continuous cranking. A 30 minutes cool down period is
necessary for additional use.
WARNING: the EEC is able to initiate a start sequence immediately
following a dry motoring sequence by setting the ENG
MODE rotary selector to IGN/START position and the ENG MASTER control
lever to ON position.

<strong>WET CRANK</strong>
The wet cranking procedure is used to motor the engine for specific fuel
or oil leak tests.
The fuel flow is commanded but both ignition systems are isolated.
The fuel goes through the IFPC to the actuator fuel pressure lines, the
engine fuel manifolds (primary fuel lines only), and nozzles. Fuel is
then sprayed in the combustion chamber.
The first steps of the wet crank sequence are the same as the ones for
the dry crank:
- the engine is not running,
- the aircraft is on ground,
- the rotary selector is set to CRANK (EEC powered, both ignition
systems isolated, ENGINE page appears),
- the ENG MAN START P/B is set to ON. (SAV opening).
When N2 speed stabilizes, the ENG MASTER lever is set to the ON
position to command the fuel flow.
After 15 seconds, the ENG MASTER lever is set to the OFF position to cut
the fuel supply.
The SAV command is maintained 30 seconds to blow all the fuel from the
engine.
The wet motoring ends by pushing the ENG MAN START pushbutton to OFF
or/and positioning the ENG MODE rotary selector to NORM
position.

<strong>NO LIGHT UP</strong>
If during an automatic start, the EEC identifies a low EGT:
- It shuts down the fuel supply and the selected igniter,
- It generates the ECAM alert \"ENG x IGN A(B) FAULT\",
- It maintains the Starter Air Valve (SAV) open to clear fuel vapors
and cool the turbine for 30 seconds,
- Then it controls simultaneously the fuel flow and both igniters,
- When N2 reaches the starter cutout speed (or the light up is
confirmed), it switches the igniters off and controls the SAV closure 1
seconds after (or 1 seconds after the starter duty cycle is exceeded).
The engine continues to accelerate and stabilizes at idle speed.
If this auto-restart attempt fails, the start is aborted and the EEC
will generate the ECAM alerts \"ENG x START FAULT (IGNITION FAULT)\"
and \"ENG x IGN A+B FAULT\".

<strong>IMPENDING HOT START</strong>
If during an automatic start, the EEC identifies an impending hot start,
it maintains the SAV open, the selected igniter on and controls a fuel
depulse procedure: it cycles fuel off for 2 seconds and back on for 12
seconds via the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) for a maximum of 28 seconds to
lower EGT below the limit. The EEC will generate the ECAM alert
\"ENG x START FAULT (HOT START)\".
If the fault disappears, the starting sequence goes on normally up to
the engine stabilizes at idle speed.
If the fault is still present, the EEC shuts down the fuel supply and
the igniter, performs a dry motor for 30 seconds and attempts a single
auto-restart.
If this auto-restart attempt fails, the start is aborted and the EEC
will generate the ECAM alert \"ENG x START FAULT (EGT OVERLIMIT)\"

- Compressor Bleed Control System.
<strong>STATOR VANE CONTROL SYSTEM</strong>
The first stage LPC stator vanes and the HPC Inlet Guide Vanes (IGV) and
the 1st, 2nd and 3rd HPC stages have variable stator vanes.
The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) controls the vanes positioning to
adjust the compressor airflow via three Stator Vane Actuators (SVAs) and
mechanical linkages. Each of the LPC SVA and the primary HPC SVA
comprises an electrically controlled dual coil torque motor and a fuel
operated Electro-Hydraulic Servo Valve (EHSV). The secondary HPC SVA is
a slave of the primary. The three SVA Linear Variable Differential

<strong>COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL (continued)</strong> <strong>BLEED CONTROL SYSTEM</strong>
The compressor bleed control system comprises one LPC Bleed Valve
Actuator (BVA) and two HPC bleed valves.
The LPC bleed system is used to control the LPC discharge 3rd stage
airflow into the fan discharge.
The EEC modulates the LPC BVA and mechanical linkages accordingly.
The LPC BVA comprises an electrically controlled dual coil torque motor
and a fuel operated EHSV.
The actuator LVDT transmits the piston position to each EEC channel
individually.
The HPC bleed system is used to control the HPC 6th stage airflow into
the core area.
The system has two ON-OFF HPC bleed valves; one is active, the other
passive, and both spring-loaded open and pneumatically closed at certain
engine operating conditions.
The active valve is EEC controlled closed through the HPC bleed valve
solenoid thanks to Ps3 pressure.
The passive valve closes when the pressure inside the HPC is high enough
to force the spring loaded valve closed.
Both are monitored by the EEC thanks to two dedicated pressure sensors.

DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3)
<strong>ENGINE BEARING COOLING SYSTEM</strong>
The engine bearing cooling system provides cooling buffer air to the
engine main bearing compartments and supplies sealing air to prevent oil
leakage. It consists of:
- the buffer/ventilation system for bearing numbers 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5 and
6,
- the engine bearing cooling system for bearing number 4.
<strong>BUFFER / VENTILATION SYSTEM</strong>
The bearing compartments numbers 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are cooled and
pressurized by the HPC 3rd stage through the LP buffer shutoff valve at
low power or by the 2.5 bleed air valve at high power through the LPC
check valve.
The LPC check valve is a passive device that is open until the HPC
3rd stage pressure delivered by the LP buffer shutoff valve is higher
than the 2.5 pressure, to prevent a reverse flow.
The LP buffer shutoff valve is open through the integrated EEC
controlled HPC buffer shutoff valve solenoid thanks to Ps3 pressure.
The cooling buffer air is distributed to the bearing compartments via
external and internal tubing, including LP shaft.
For monitoring, the Buffer Air Pressure Sensor (BAPS) provides a buffer
air pressure signal to both EEC channels.

<strong>COMPARTMENT COOLING</strong>
The compartment cooling system ensures the ventilation of the fan
compartment, the core compartment and dedicated components inside the
core compartment.
The cooling of the fan compartment is achieved through a passive
ventilation system. Outside airflow circulates from the top scoop around
the fan case and exhausts through bottom holes and gabs of the fan
cowls.
The cooling of the core compartment is achieved through a passive
ventilation system. Fan bypass airstream is directed to the nacelle
core, ignition leads, igniter plugs and Environmental Control System
(ECS) bleed valves through openings on the inner contour of the thrust
reverser cowl doors and exhausts through bottom holes and gabs of the
Inner Fixed Structure (IFS) trailing edge. Additional tubes are
dedicated for the cooling of the ACC Valve, Starter Air Valve (SAV) and
the Flow Divider Valve (FDV).

(3)
<strong>THROTTLE CONTROL LEVER</strong>
The Throttle control handle comprises: o a throttle control lever which
incorporates stop devices, autothrust instinctive disconnect pushbutton
switch o a graduated fixed sector
o a reverse latching lever.
The throttle control lever is linked to a mechanical rod. This rod
drives the input lever of the throttle control artificial feel unit.
The throttle control lever moves over a range from -20 deg.TLA (Reverser
Full Throttle stop) to +45 deg.TLA:
o -20 degrees TLA corresponds to Reverser Full Throttle stop o +45
degrees TLA corresponds to Forward Full Throttle stop An intermediate
mechanical stop is set to 0 deg. TLA. This stop is overridden when the
reverse latching lever is pulled up for selection of the reverse power.
This stop is reset as soon as the throttle control lever is selected
back to forward thrust area.
In the forward thrust area, there are two detent points, the MAX CLIMB
detent point set to 25 deg.TLA and the MAX CONTINUOUS/FLEX
TAKE-OFF detent point set to 35 deg.TLA.
In the reverse thrust throttle range, there is one detent point at - 6
deg.TLA. This position agrees with the selection of the thrust reverser
command and the Reverse Idle setting.
In the middle throttle range (0 deg. To 35 deg.TLA), the autothrust
function can be active if engaged. This range agrees with the selection
of MAX CLIMB or MAX CONTINUOUS thrust limit mode (in single operation).
If the autothrust is not engaged, the engine control is manual.
In the forward range (35 deg. To 45 deg.TLA), the autothrust function
cannot be activated (except in alpha floor condition).This range agrees
with the selection of FLEX TAKE-OFF/MAX TAKE-OFF Mode.

<strong>THROTTLE CONTROL UNIT</strong>
A mechanical rod transmits the throttle control lever movement. It
connects the throttle artificial feel unit to the input lever of the
throttle control unit. The throttle control unit comprises:
-An input lever
-Mechanical stops, which limit the angular range
-2 resolvers (one resolver per FADEC (ECU/EEC)
-6 potentiometers installed three by three
-A device, which drives the resolver and the potentiometer
-A pin device for rigging the resolver and potentiometers
-1 switch whose signal is dedicated to the EIU
-2 output electrical connectors
The input lever drives two gear sectors assembled face to face. Each
sector drives itself a set of one resolver and three potentiometers. The
relationship between the throttle lever angle and throttle resolver
angle (TRA) IS LINEAR AND 1 DEG.TLA = 1.9 TRA. The accuracy of the
throttle control unit (error between the input lever position and the
resolver angle) is 0.5 deg.TRA. The maximum discrepancy between the
signals generated by two resolvers is 0.25 deg.TRA.
The TLA resolver operates in two quadrants. The first quadrant is used
for positive angles and the second quadrant for negative angles. Each
resolver is dedicated to one FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) and receives its
electrical excitation current (6 VAC) from the related FADEC channel
(ECU / EEC)
The ECU considers a throttle resolver angle value: o less than -47.5
deg.TRA
or
o greater than 98.8 deg.TRA as resolver position signal failure.
The ECU includes a resolver fault accommodation logic. This logic allows
engine operation after a failure or a complete loss of the throttle
resolver position signal.

<strong>BUMP FUNCTION (PW1100G and IAE ENGINES ONLY)</strong> If an airline requests
the bump function, this function is selected in the aircraft by guarded
pushbutton switch with TLA at TOGA position (one on each throttle
control lever). With this switch, a signal can be sent to the two FADEC
units at the same time through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU).
Thrust bump can be used to obtain additional thrust capability during
takeoff It can be used either with two engines or in single engine
operation.
With the throttle levers at TOGA and the Bump P/B pushed, \'B\' appears

<strong>THRUST LIMIT MODE</strong>
The throttle levers are used as thrust limit mode selectors.
Depending on the throttle lever position, a thrust limit mode is
selected and appears on the upper ECAM display.
If the throttle levers are set between two detent points, the upper
detent will determine the thrust limit mode.
An additional Soft Go-Around (SGA) mode is available.
It is automatically selected if during approach, the TOGA detent is set
and the thrust levers are then moved back to the FLX/MCT detent.
NOTE:
Note:
- On the ground with the engines running, the displayed N1
rate limit corresponds to the TO/GA thrust limit whatever the thrust
lever position is.
- On the ground with the engines running and if FLEX mode is selected,
FLEX N1 is displayed whenever the thrust lever position is between IDLE
and FLX/MCT.
<strong>N1 LIMIT</strong>
For each thrust limit mode selection, an N1 rating limit is computed by
the EEC according to Thrust Lever Angle (TLA) and the air data
parameters from the Air Data Inertial and Reference Units (ADIRUs).
This indication is displayed in green on the upper ECAM display near the
thrust limit mode indication.
<strong>PREDICTED N1</strong>
The predicted N1 is indicated by a blue circle on the N1 indicator and
corresponds to the value determined by the TLA.

<strong>PRIMARY PARAMETERS</strong>
<strong>ROTATIONAL SPEED PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION</strong>
The N1 speed sensor is mounted on the rear of the Compressor
Intermediate Case (CIC) at approximately 4 o\'clock position. The N1
speed sensor detects the rotational speed of LP rotor assembly. The
indication is shown in the ECAM EWD by a needle and a N1 digital
indication display.
The N2 speed sensor is installed on the right hand side of the Angle
Gear Box (AGB). The N2 speed sensor detects the rotational speed of the
HP rotor assembly. The N2 rotational speed is indicated in the ECAM EWD
by digits.
The digital display is shown on a grey background during engine start.
Both the N1 and N2 speed sensors are dual channel magnetic speed sensors
and transmit the corresponding signals to the EEC for processing and
monitoring and to the PHMU via the EEC for vibrations computation.
The N1 and N2 sensors are line replaceable units.
The Fan Speed (Nf) sensor senses the fan rotor speed and sends it to the
EEC. There is no indication of Nf on the ECAM.
The EEC uses the Fan Speed sensor to detect de-coupling of the Fan Shaft
from the LP shaft (sheared shaft) by comparing the Nf to the N1. The
PHMU uses the Fan Speed from the EEC in conjunction with Fan Rotor
vibrations to monitor Fan Rotor vibration and calculate trim balance
solution for maintenance purposes.
The Nf sensor is a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU).

<strong>VIBRATION PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION</strong>
The vibration monitoring function within the PHMU uses the two vibration
sensors to measure the Fan related vibrations (VIB N1) and the Core
related vibrations (VIB N2), stores this information and sends it to the
EEC. It is used for ECAM display in the ENGINE SD page.
It\'s also used for the fan trim balance procedure.
The PHMU receives Nf, N1 and N2 data from EEC to capture and compute the
appropriate vibration data.
The Forward Vibration Sensor is a single channel piezoelectric
accelerometer, installed at 10 o\'clock on the HP Compressor casing.
The Aft Vibration Sensor is a single channel piezoelectric
accelerometer, installed at 3 o\'clock on the LP Turbine casing.
If the signal from one vibration sensor (either forward or aft vibration
sensor) is lost during engine operation, the vibration monitoring
function is still able to provide both vibration signals (N1 and N2) for
cockpit display. However, the display for the affected sensor will be
presented in degraded mode.

<strong>THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM LAYOUT</strong>
The thrust reverser system is of the aerodynamic blockage type.
For each engine, it consists of two translating sleeves, ten blocker
doors and cascade vanes to redirect fan discharge airflow.
Each system is pressurized by its dedicated hydraulic power source:
- the green hydraulic pressure for engine 1,
- and the yellow one for engine 2.
Each system is made of one Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) including an
Isolation Control Valve (ICV) and a Directional Control Valve (DCV), two
worm drive actuators per side, locking and monitoring devices.
To avoid inadvertent deployment, the system operates under multiple and
independent commands and it comprises several lines of defense: primary
locks in each actuator and one tertiary lock at the bottom of each
translating sleeve.

When the thrust-reverser lever is set to the stow position, the
following sequence occurs.
1-When the EEC receives the signals from the TCU resolvers (TLA &gt;
-4.8°), it de-energizes the DCV. The pressure is sent only to the
actuators rod chambers to stow the translating sleeves until the
actuators internal primary locks are re-engaged.
2-15 seconds after the SECs receive the signals from the TCU
potentiometers (TLA &gt; -2°), they de-energize the TLVs to re-engage the

flow between the AOHE and the FOHE. The oil flow that is directed to the
AOHE also flows through the IDGOOHE.
The FOHEBV is electrically controlled and monitored by the Electronic
Engine Control (EEC) according to fuel temperature.
Oil from the heat exchangers is sent via the OCM to the No. 3, 4, 5, 6
bearings and to the AGB and MGB.
Oil is also sent to the Variable Oil Reduction Valve (VORV) / Journal
Oil Shuttle Valve (JOSV) which modulates the flow of oil to the No. 1,
1.5, 2 and Fan Drive Gear System (FDGS) based on engine power settings.
The VORV is electrically controlled and monitored by the EEC to bypass
part of the oil flow to the front bearings at low power setting.
The JOSV is a mechanical device that keeps a continuous supply of oil to
the fan drive journal bearings from the main oil supply in normal
condition or from the auxiliary oil supply in windmill or zero or
negative gravity conditions.
Nozzles in the main bearing compartments and gearboxes supply the oil to
the different bearings, gears, seals, and accessory drive splines. Last
chance strainers are provided at the entrance to the compartments to
protect the oil nozzles from debris introduced to the oil system
downstream of the main oil filter.
The other part of the filtered oil is sent through the Active Oil Damper
Valve (AODV) to the No. 3 bearing damper for N2 vibration control.
The AODV is electrically controlled by the EEC to supply oil to the
damper during starting and acceleration and shut it off at high power.

<strong>OIL SCAVENGE AND VENTING</strong>
The engine oil scavenge system is used to return the hot lubrication oil
to the tank through the LSOP.
The LSOP has six scavenge pumps that are used to pull scavenge oil from
the:
- No. 1, 1.5, 2 bearing and FDGS,
- No. 3 bearing compartment,
- No. 4 bearing compartment,
- No. 5 and 6 bearing compartment,
- MGB,
- AGB.
Six magnetic chip collectors, installed upstream of the scavenge pumps,
catch ferrous metal particles.
The scavenge pumps send the scavenge oil to the oil tank through the Oil
Debris Monitor (ODM) and the deaerator.
The ODM senses the size and quantity of ferrous and non-ferrous
particles in the scavenge oil system and the corresponding signal is
processed by the Prognostic Health Monitoring Unit (PHMU).
The engine oil breather system is used to remove sealing air from the
bearing compartments, separate the air from the oil, and vent it
overboard.
In the tank, the deaerator is a static component that separates the air
that is mixed with the scavenged oil. Part of the air is used to
pressurize the tank and the excess is sent to the centrifugal deoiler.
The deoiler is mechanically connected and driven by the MGB and receives
the air/oil mist internally from the MGB, from the tank by the breather
line and from the No. 3 bearing compartment by a dedicated breather vent
tube.

MAINTENANCE (2) <strong>ENGINE OIL SERVICING</strong>
CAUTION: Caution: The engine should be shut down for at least 5
minutes prior to oil servicing. This allows the residual pressure in the
oil tank to decrease. If you open the filler cap when there is pressure
in the tank the hot oil can spray out and burn you.
NOTE:
No te: If possible, the engine oil should be checked and serviced within
15 to 120 minutes after engine shutdown.
Note: If the engine has been shutdown for more than 2 hours, Procedure
to open the filler cap:
- open the door on the left fan cowl,
- check oil level on the sight gage on the oil tank,
- raise filler cap handle to vertical (unlocked position),
- turn the oil filler cap counterclockwise and lift to remove,
- add approved oil as necessary up to the FULL mark on the sight gage,
- install oil filler cap - make sure to LOCK the cap.
- To refit the filler cap:
Inspect the cap and tank spout for condition. Locate the cap in the
opening with the handle in the vertical position (making sure you do not
trap the retaining lanyard under the cap). Once engaged, turn the handle
clockwise to lock the cap in place. When the cap is then engaged and
locked* press the handle and lower the handle until it lies flat, and
is no longer in the vertical position. Inspect the cap to ensure it is
sitting evenly flat all around and that there is no obvious
misalignment.
Clear up any debris, and wipe any excess oil from the cap. Close and
lock the servicing door in the cowling and ensure you complete any
technical paperwork required as to the quantity of oil uplifted.
*Note:- A little vertical tug of the cap assembly upwards provides a
positive confirmation that the cap is engaged and locked EFFECTIVITY:

MAINTENANCE (2) <strong>OIL DEBRIS MONITOR (ODM)</strong>
An Oil Debris Monitor (ODM) is used to sense the size and quantity of
ferrous and non-ferrous metal in the scavenge oil system. It is an
in-line sensor installed between the main oil scavenge line and the
de-aerator in the oil tank assembly.
When the ODM detects metallic debris in the engine lubrication system,
it signals the Prognostics and Health Management Unit (PHMU) which
processes to the Engine Electronic Controller (EEC); then the Engine
Interface Unit (EIU) generates appropriate maintenance message.
The ODM is a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU).

MAINTENANCE (2) <strong>OIL DEBRIS MONITOR (ODM) (continued)</strong> <strong>CHIP
COLLECTORS</strong>
The engine oil scavenge system has six magnetic chip collectors which
catch ferrous metal particles that might exist in the scavenge and
supply oil:
The No. 4 bearing magnetic chip collector is located in the No. 4
bearing oil scavenge line.
The Angle Gearbox (AGB), Main Gearbox (MGB), No. 1, 1.5 and 2
Bearing and Fan Drive Gear System (FDGS), No. 3 bearing, and No.
5 and 6 bearing magnetic chip collectors are located on the lubrication
and scavenge oil pump, at the 6 o\'clock position.
The six chip collectors are bayonet-type plugs, they are LRUs.

MAINTENANCE (2) <strong>MEL / DEACTIVATION</strong>
<strong>START VALVE MANUAL OPERATION</strong>
In case of an electrical failure of the Start Air Valve (SAV), the SAV
can be operated manually to start the engine.
The aircraft may be dispatched per MEL with the valve INOP closed.
- First establish the communications with the cockpit (Interphone jack
on engine inlet cowl),
- then on command from the cockpit, insert a 3/8\" square drive
extension into the manual wrench socket located on the RH thrust
reverser inner-fixed-structure at 3 O\'clock.
- turn the valve shaft, this opens the butterfly valve.
WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM THE DANGER AREAS AT THE
FRONT AND THE SIDES OF THE ENGINE DURING
OPERATION. THE SUCTION IS SUFFICIENT AT
THE AIR INTAKE COWL TO PULL A PERSON INTO
(IN PART OR FULLY) THE ENGINE. THIS CAN
KILL A PERSON OR CAUSE A BAD INJURY.
The valve will close when the shaft is released. The SAV is an LRU.
