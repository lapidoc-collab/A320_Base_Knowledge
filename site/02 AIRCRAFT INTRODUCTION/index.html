INSTRUMENT PANEL (ENHANCED) The enhanced single aisle aircraft main
instrument panel instrumentation has been updated. Liquid Crystal
Displays (LCDs) replace the existing CRTs. A single integrated
electronic indicator, the Integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS)
replaces the standby instrumentation: Standby horizon, Airspeed
indicator and Altimeter.

SA FAMILY INTRODUCTION (1) COCKPIT PRESENTATION (continued) SIDE
CONSOLES The Conventional Aircraft control yoke is noticeably missing in
the Airbus Single Aisle aircraft. The Side Stick Controller (SSC)
replaces the Conventional Aircraft yoke. There is one SSC for each pilot
mounted in the side consoles. The Aircraft nose wheel is steerable. The
flight cr w operates the Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) by using the NWS
tillers mounted outboard of the SSC on the same side console. Behind the
most forward side console are installed several other compartments along
the outboard sides of the cockpit. These side consoles are used as
stowage space for documents, oxygen masks, fire xtinguisher and
microphone and headset connections

SA FAMILY INTRODUCTION (1) COCKPIT PHILOSOPHY Prior to the design of the
A320 family aircraft, the designers examined previous generation
aircraft cockpit system indications. A decision was made on the system
indicator lights on the overhead panel that indicator lights do not come
on when systems are in normal operation and there are no failures. This
ergonomic design enabled the pilots to immediately see when a system is
faulty or has been manually shut off. Most of the pushbuttons with light
have two stable positions: pressed in and released out, each position is
related to a control signal sent to a system. Pressed in (recessed): -
normally used system activation (AUTO or ON), - temporarily used system
activation (ON), - system activated for maintenance operation (ON) or
override (OVRD). Released out (flush with the panel) - deactivation of a
system (OFF), - manual activation of a system (ON), - activation of an
alternate system (ALTN). Some pushbuttons have only one stable
position: - released out. When pushed, they send a control signal to the
system.

SA FAMILY INTRODUCTION (1) GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS The World
Airlines Technical Operations Glossary (WATOG) definitio of Ground
Support Equipment (GSE) is: equipment required on the ground to support
the operation and maintenance of the aircraft and all its airborne
equipment. Airbus divides GSE into two categories: - tools, - standard
GSE. Tools can be split into two categories: - standard tools, -
specific tools
STANDARD TOOLS Standard tools are hand tools such as spanners, sockets,
gauges, torque wrenches... The specifications (size, range, capacity,
accuracy...) are given in the related Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM)
task to let operators use the tool brand of their choice. Standard tools
for Aircraft Maintenance are all in US units. Metric tools maybe
required for shop maintenance. They are not required for aircraft
maintenance but will be required to maintain Airbus specific tools and,
in some cases, for aircraf component maintenance in the shop.

SA FAMILY INTRODUCTION (1) GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS
(continued) SPECIFIC TOOLS Specific tools are tools designed by Airbus
or by its vendors to carry out given maintenance tasks on the aircraft
or one of its components. All maintenance tools for "on - aircraft"
maintenance such as the AMM, Trouble Shooting Manual (TSM)... and for
"off - aircraft" maintenance such as the Component Maintenance Manual
(CMM) are found in the Support Equipment Summary (SES) document. The SES
covers all Airbus aircraft types and all associated documentation. If a
tool does not appear in the SES it is not a tool for Airbus aircraft or
equipment. All specific tools called up for "on - aircraft" maintenance
in the AMM and the TSM are illustrated in the Tool Equipment Manual
(TEM).

STANDARD GSE Airbus considers as standard GSE any GSE which is not
designed for a specific aircraft type, ut it can/could be used on a
number of different aircraft types. Standard GSE includes, but is not
limited: tow bars, axle/wheel change jacks, tripod maintenance jacks,
access platforms, hydraulic ground carts, electrical power units, etc...

SA FAMILY INTRODUCTION (1) SAFETY ITEMS When you work on aircraft, make
sure that you obey all the AMM safety procedures. This will prevent
injury to persons and/or damage to the aircraft The following terms are
used in the AMM and are defined as foll ws: WARNING: call attention to
the use of material, processes, methods, procedures or limits, which
must be followed precisely to avoid injury or death to persons. CAUTION:
call attention to methods and procedures, which must be followed to
avoid damage to equipment.
