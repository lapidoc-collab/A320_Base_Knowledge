CKPT ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT TEST &amp; DIMMING D/O (3) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
POWER SUPPLY AND ASSOCIATED C/B
An ANNunciator LighT test is used for the lighting of all ANN LTs
mounted on the panels and instruments in the cockpit. A relay (relative
to system) or internal contacts (case of P/BSWs position indication)
control the lighting of each ANN LT. Four different busbars: - AC1
supply with 103XP, - AC2 supply with 202XP, - 115 VAC STATic INVerter
bus with 901XP, - ESSential supply with 801XP, supply the ANN LTs with 5
VAC-400 Hz through the transformers. In the case of emergency supply
only busbar 901XP is serviceable.
The power supply is composed of: - busbar 103XP (AC1) which supplies
transformer 37LP through the circuit breaker 26LP located on the circuit
breaker panel 122VU, - busbar 202XP (AC2) which supplies transformer
36LP through the circuit breaker 27LP located on the circuit breaker
panel 122VU, - busbar 801XP supplies transformer 31LP through the
circuit breaker 29LP located on the overhead panel 49VU, - busbar 801XP
supplies transformer 35LP through the circuit breaker 29LP and the
busbar 901XP supplies emergency through the circuit breaker 28LP located
on the circuit breaker panel 122VU, - busbar 206PP supplies the ANN LT
test relay coils.
TRANSFORMERS
COCKPIT ANN LT SWITCH
There are four transformers; each is supplied with 115 V-400 Hz. Each
one is connected to a different busbar. They supply: - 5 VAC-400 Hz for
the ANN LTs installed on the overhead panel and on the instrument
panel, - 6.3 V voltage (full wave rectified) to supply the AUTO LAND,
MASTER WARNING and CAUTION lights and Audio Control Panels (ACPs). The
secondary winding of each transformer has: - 7 outputs of 5 VAC each
mounted in parallel; each one is protected by a delayed action fuse set
at 4 A, - 2 outputs of 6.3 V each protected by the same type of fuse.
The primary winding of each transformer has two inputs to get the
correct dimming level (DIMmed position). If the 115 V supply is switched
over to either input we obtain at the secondary winding: - the 5 VAC
(BRighT position) or 3 VAC (DIM position), - the 6.3 VAC (BRT position)
or 4.3 VAC (DIM position) for rectified voltages.
A switch with 3 positions (DIM, BRT, TEST) is located on the overhead
control and indicating panel 25VU. The crew uses this switch to dim the
cockpit annunciator lights or to test their operation.

ANN LT TEST AND INTERFACE BOARDS They are located in the avionics
compartment in the annunciator light test unit 70VU: - 4 are related to
the ANN LTs supplied by the AC1 system, - 3 are related to the ANN LTs
supplied by the AC2 generation, - 7 are related to the ANN LTs supplied
by the ESS generation. Each board comprises: - 2 relays supplied by
busbar 206PP with 28 VDC through circuit breaker 30LP located on the
rear circuit breaker panel 122VU. These 2 relays are used for the ANN LT
tests when the switch 33LP is in the TEST position, - 10 relays supplied
by the various A/C systems with 28 VDC. They supply the ANN LT with 5
VAC whereas the system data are supplied with 28 VDC

FOUR-STAGES RELAY They are located in the relay box 103VU. They are used
for the test of the equipment annunciator lights (high intensity) or of
other annunciator lights (ON - OFF). The busbar 206PP supplies 28 VDC to
the coil of these relays through the circuit breaker 30LP located on the
rear circuit breaker panel 122VU

CKPT ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT TEST &amp; DIMMING D/O (3) SYSTEM OPERATION The
cockpit ANN LT SW is mainly used to test all the ANN LTs in the cockpit
or to dim the ANN LTs in night conditions.
ANN LT SW IN BRT POSITION In this position, the lighting of the ANN LT
is activated: - either if the relative system failed, - or if there is
an action on the relative P/BSW (OFF position).

CABIN LIGHTS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION (3) GENERAL
PASSENGER READING LIGHTS
The cabin lights are controlled through the Cabin Intercommunication
Data System (CIDS), which includes the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP), two
directors (DIRs) one active, one in standby, and Decoder/Encoder Units
(DEUs). Some DEUs are used for the light system, they are called type
"A" DEUs. Signals from the FAP are processed by the DIRs to control the
cabin lights. The DIRs transmit these signals to each DEU.
The passenger reading lights can be controlled with buttons on the
Passengers Service Unit (PSU) and through the FAP. The reading lights
are not adjustable because the Light Emitting Diode (LED) light
diffusion angle is sufficient. Reading lights are supplied by the active
CIDS DIR via DEUs A and Passenger Interface and Supply Adapters (PISAs)
installed in the Passenger Service Units (PSUs). The test of the
passenger reading lights can be done either via the MCDU of from the
FAP.
CABIN GENERAL LIGHTS The related DEUs control the cabin fluorescent
lamps according to the selection on the FAP. The FAP controls the DEUs
via the CIDS DIRs to give brightness (BRT) levels which are: 100% BRT,
50% BRT (Dimming 1), 10% BRT (Dimming 2) or different lighting scenarios
with brightness levels between 100% to 5% for their related window
and/or ceiling lights. The cabin fluorescent lamps have Advanced
Integrated Ballast Units (AIBUs). The ballast units receive FAP commands
via CIDS DIRs and DEUs A for brightness level control. This is according
to different lighting scenarios programmed in the Cabin Assignment
Module (CAM) flash card. The ballast units are designed to get a
continuous dimming from 100% to 5% light BRT level. There is one reading
light for each passenger seat.
ENTRY LIGHTS The related DEUs control the entry fluorescent lamps
according to the FAP selection. The FAP controls the DEUs via the CIDS
DIRs in order to give BRT levels (100%, 50% or 10%).
ATTENDANT WORK LIGHTS The attendant work lights are controlled by
buttons in the attendant area or the FAP. The attendant work lights have
a LED technology, and are supplied by the active CIDS DIR via DEUs A and
stand alone PISAs. The test of the attendant work lights can be done
either via the MCDU or from the FAP. NOTE: Note: The Mean Time Between
Failure (MTBF) of LED reading lights is 100,000 flight hours. Thus,
there is no replacement procedure apart from replacing the complete
light assembly. Cabin signs must be replaced if three or more LEDs have
failed (de-graded performance). If a full failure of the FAP and/or CIDS
occurs or cabin decompression occurs, the entrance lighting comes on
automatically to 100% BRT level.
NOTE: If the engines are running and the cockpit door is open, the CIDS
directors signal the DEU of the left forward entry light to set the
intensity to 10%.

controls and display keys are used for the selection of FWD and aft
entrance areas lighting, BRighTness (100%), DIMming 1 (50%), and DIM2
(10%). The cutting-up of the cabin is possible into 1, 2 or 3
independent zones (selection of 1 zone is standard, and optional for 2
and 3 zones) such as FIRST CLASS, BUSINESS CLASS and TOURIST CLASS. To
control these zones, controls and displays are available with three
levels of lighting, BRT, DIM1 and DIM2. The Main On/Off key is used to
switch ON/OFF cabin zone and entrance areas lighting with 100%
intensity, this function is only available on ground. The AISLE key is
used to switch ON/OFF the ceiling lighting, and the WinDOw key to switch
ON/OFF the windows lighting. Additional functions are Reading/Light Set
(on) and R/L Reset (off). An automatic DIM of the FWD entrance area is
activated if the cockpit door is opened and the engines are running. In
case of cabin decompression, the passenger compartment lighting
automatically switches to full brightness (100%).

FAP CABIN LIGHTING PAGE (3) SCENARIO BASED LIGHTING CONTROL (OPTIONAL)
This function is used for the control of the cabin lighting through
pre-programmed scenarios. The CIDS gives up to 6 pre-programmed lighting
scenarios defined in NIGHT and DAY modes for the entire cabin and/or per
cabin zone. As an example, these scenarios can be used for the different
cabin services (e.g. Wake up, Sleep, Video, Dinner,...) or flight phases
(e.g. Boarding, Take/Off, Landing,...). All these scenarios are assigned
in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The GENERAL CABIN SETTINGS keys
are used for the cabin lighting ON/OFF control and cabin lighting
settings, the selections can be applied to individual class zones by
selecting the class Select key. Continuous dimming for each cabin zone
is possible by using "+" or "-" keys on the FAP CABIN LIGHTING page. The
MAINTenance key is for lavatory light full brightness.

SEAT &amp; FLOOR MOUNTED EMER LIGHTS SYS D/O (3) GENERAL The emergency
lighting system supplies lighting in case of failure of the main
lighting system or during emergency conditions. The Emergency Power
Supply Units (EPSUs) supply all these different lights. The emergency
lights have 6V DC Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), except for lavatory
auxiliary lights (28V DC LEDs). The external emergency lights such as
over-wing and escape slide use bulbs technology.
ELECTRICAL SUPPLY The EPSUs are supplied with 28V DC from the ESSential
SHEDdable BUS for operation and 115V AC from the NORMal BUS voltage
sensing.
EPSU The EPSUs supply the following lights: - exit signs lights, - cabin
emergency lights, - seat mounted emergency lights and exit location
lights, - wall mounted emergency exit location light, - wall mounted
exit marking sign, - wall mounted emergency exit, - wall mounted
emergency light, - escape slide lights, - over-wing emergency lights, -
lavatory auxiliary lights, - and escape hatch-handle lights. The EPSUs
also monitor the correct voltage of the AC and DC buses. The EPSUs
convert 28V DC into 6V DC to operate their associated lights. An
internal 6V DC battery in each EPSU is charged continuously when the ESS
SHED BUS is energized and the system is not activated.

SEAT &amp; FLOOR MOUNTED EMER LIGHTS SYS D/O (3) The cabin emergency lights,
the exit signs, the escape hatch-handle lights and the seat mounted
lights come on. The 28V DC/6V DC converters of the EPSUs supply these
loads as long as the 28V DC ESS SHED BUS is available. If the 28V DC
SHED ESS BUS voltage falls below 16V, the EPSUs internal batteries
continue to supply the loads for at least 10 minutes. The batteries are
no longer charged.
OPERATION The EMERgency EXIT LighT switch on the overhead panel controls
the emergency lighting system. The EMER EXIT LT switch has three
positions: OFF, ARMed and ON. Each of these positions sends a discrete
ground signal to the EPSUs.
OTHER CASES
OFF POSITION
Independently of the switch positions, the integral lights in the
respective escape slides come on when the passenger/crew doors or the
emergency exit doors are opened with the escape slides armed. When the
emergency exit hatches are open and the slides are released, the
respective over-wing emergency lights and the integral lights in the
respective escape slide come on. In the event of excessive cabin
depressurization, the exit marking signs and the exit location signs
automatically come on.
The system is supplied when the busbars 103XP and 801PP are energized.
With the EMER EXIT LT switch and the EMER pushbutton switch on the FAP
in the OFF positions, the power supply units control-line OFF is
grounded, All lights and signs are off and the battery in each power
supply unit is on charge. The EMER EXIT LT OFF annunciator lights come
on. NOTE: Note: The EXIT signs and the emergency escape hatch-handle
lights come on with EMER EXIT LT switch OFF, when the NO SMOKING switch
is in the ON position or in AUTO position with landing gear extended, or
in option, when the EXIT switch is in the ON position or in AUTO
position with landing gear extended.
ARM POSITION In the ARM position the EMER EXIT LT OFF annunciator light
goes off. When the 115V AC NORM BUS voltage is not available, the cabin
emergency lighting and the FPEEPMS light come on. The power is supplied
from the 28V DC/6V DC converter in the related EPSU. When the 28V DC ESS
SHED BUS voltage is not available, the batteries of all EPSUs supply the
emergency lighting system for at least 10 minutes. The batteries are no
longer charged.
TEST Each EPSU has a test circuit which tests the condition of the
battery unit, the logic unit and the related loads. If a fault is
detected it is reported to CIDS. An EPSU SYStem TEST can be triggered
from MCDU or CFDS Emulation on FAP. The EPSU BATtery CAPacity TEST can
only be triggered from MCDU. The duration of this test is around 3
hours. An individual test on each EPSU must be carried out when the
tests through MCDU or CFDS Emulation on FAP fail. This isolated test
starts when you push the TEST P/B on the EPSU
ON POSITION In the ON position the emergency lighting system comes on,
as if the EMERgency P/B on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) was pushed.
