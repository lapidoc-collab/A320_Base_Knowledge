WATER/WASTE SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The water and
waste system consist of three subsystems: - potable water system, -
waste water system, - toilet system.
WATER FLUID STORAGE (A318 / A319 / A321) The potable water tank is
installed in the pressurized LH underfloor area rear of the aft cargo
compartment. An indication system monitors the water quantities.
POTABLE WATER SYSTEM The potable water system supplies water from the
water tank through a distribution system to the user. The water is
supplied to water faucets in the galleys and lavatories. The system also
supplies water to the water heaters and vacuum toilet units.
Mechanically or electrically operated valves control the supply of the
potable water system. Compressed air is used to pressurize the system to
supply water from the tank to the necessary service locations. The air
pressure is supplied from the bleed air system in normal configuration
or a ground pressure connection for maintenance. An air compressor can
be installed as an option. Each lavatory can be isolated from the
potable water distribution system through a manual shut-off valve.

WATER/WASTE SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued)
POTABLE WATER HEATING, ICE PROTECTION AND WINTERIZATION PROTECTION One
water heater is installed in each lavatory and in each galley. Water
pipes, where icing conditions can occur are insulated and heated by tape
electrical heaters. The heating elements are controlled automatically by
two anti ice control units installed in the cargo compartments. The
potable water service panel heating is installed to prevent ice
formation in the potable water servicing panel in icing conditions.
Optionally the fill/drain nipple as well as the overflow nipple are
electrically heated to prevent ice formation of the remaining water in
the fill/drain nipple and overflow nipple which could cause a blockage
or damage to the nipples. A thermostat controls the potable water
service panel heating. In winter conditions, the potable water system
must be drained during night stops.

POTABLE WATER CONTROL AND INDICATING (FAP) The water and waste
indications are displayed on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP). On the

WATER/WASTE SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) TOILET SYSTEM CONTROL AND
INDICATING
SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) TOILET SYSTEM The toilet system gives
sanitary facilities for the passengers and crews. The system is a
differential pressure toilet system and uses potable water for flushing.
TOILET SYSTEM FLUSHING OPERATION The system uses potable water from the
aircraft pressurized water system to flush the toilet. A flush valve
opens to remove waste from the toilet bowl to an under floor waste
holding tank. At high altitude, the differential pressure between the
cabin and the atmospheres is sufficient to move the waste from the
toilet bowl into the waste holding tank. At low altitude or on ground, a
vacuum generator starts to give the necessary differential pressure in
the waste system to move the waste from the bowl to the tank. The Vacuum
System Controller Function (VSCF), integrated in the Cabin
Intercommunication Data System (CIDS), controls the flushing system
operation and stops the operation when the waste servicing panel is
open. When the tank is full, the liquid level sensor stops the system
operation.
The vacuum toilet system is connected to the CIDS. The CIDS controls and
monitors the system functions and the related electric components. A
Flush Control Unit (FCU) per toilet controls the rinse and flush cycle
as soon as the flush SW is pressed. The system uses potable water from
the potable water system to rinse the toilet bowl. When the waste
holding tank is full, a signal is sent to the CIDS, which shuts down the
toilet systems. The FAP displays the waste tank quantity stored in the
waste holding tank when the Water/Waste key on the FAP is selected.
TOILET SYSTEM WASTE DISPOSAL The waste holding tank is installed on the
right of the aircraft under the floor behind the bulk cargo compartment.
The tank includes a water separator, a liquid level transmitter, a
liquid level sensor, a waste drain valve and two rinse line connections.
TOILET SYSTEM WASTE TANK HEATING (OPTIONAL) The waste holding tank can
be insulated. The lines between the tank and the service panel with the
waste drain valve can be insulated and heated.

POTABLE WATER SYSTEM D/O (3) STORAGE
INDICATING
The potable water is stored in one tank installed in the pressurized
underfloor area of the right hand fuselage, aft of the forward cargo
compartment. The potable water tank has a capacity of 200 l (53 US gal).
The quantity indication system indicates how much water is available in
the potable water tank. The quantity transmitter transmits the signal to
the indicator on the water service panel. It also sends the information
to a Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B, which in turn interfaces with the
active Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) director to display
on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) the water tank contents in
percentage of volume. The TANK FULL light on the service panel comes on
when the tank is full.
PRESSURIZATION Pressurization of the system enables water supply from
the tank to the necessary service location. Compressed air is tapped
from the cross feed line of the engine or APU bleed air. On ground, when
the bleed air system is not available, the ground air pressure supply
system is used. If installed, the air compressor will supply air when
bleed is not available. During servicing, the overflow valve is used to
depressurize the potable water tank.
DISTRIBUTION Potable water from the water tank is supplied through a
system of distribution lines, which are routed below the passenger
compartment floor. A part of the forward distribution line goes through
a hose for added protection of the avionics equipment. The potable water
distribution lines are insulated and electrically heated to prevent ice
formation in and around the lines. Each lavatory and each galley have an
individual and manual shutoff valve.
FILLING The Filling is achieved through a fill/drain valve operated by
the fill/drain control handle on the potable water service panel. The
fill/drain control handle simultaneously opens the electrically
motorized overflow valve for venting. The quantity transmitter sends a
tank-full signal to close the fill/drain valve automatically. Manual
operation is possible via control handles dedicated to each valve.
Maximum permissible pressure to fill the potable water tank is 50 psi
(3.4 bars). CAUTION: WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER YOU MUST OPEN THE OVERFLOW
VALVE MANUALLY PRIOR TO THE FILLING TO PREVENT WATER SPILLAGE IN THE
CABIN.
HEATING A water heater is installed under the wash basin inside the
sanitary unit cabinet. If the quantity transmitter detects a low level
into the water tank, it cuts the electrical supply of the water heater.
A thermostat allows the water temperature to be maintained between 45 °C
(113 °F) and 48 °C (118,4 °F). An over temperature safety device
protects the heating element.

position. From a ground service cart we'll fill the water tank: - the
system takes on water and tank slowly fills up, - also the cabin water
system is supplied, - FAP water indication increases. The tank is full
now so the tank sensor will trigger the "Green Tank Full Light" in
service panel, the Fill/Drain valve returns to closed, also the overflow
valve will close and the overflow valve light will go OFF when the valve
is closed again.

POTABLE WATER SYSTEM D/O (3) DRAINING The draining operation is achieved
through the fill/drain valve and three motorized valves, two drain
valves and the overflow valve. Their opening and closing is controlled
via electrical signals from the manual operated control handle. All
valves can also be operated via their related control handle, if no
electrical power is available.
All valves will close and all lights in the service panel will go off
when the valves are closed again. The potable water service panel is
closed so the door limit switch will cut the power. The FAP water
indication page disappears and if installed, the air compressor starts
again.
OPERATION For the draining of the potable water tank in this case: - the
tank is full, - the aircraft is electrically supplied. But the draining
can be done from every level. The panel door opens, so the system is
electrically powered and the FAP water indication page is automatically
called. The Fill/Drain control handle is positioned to the drain
position and pulled out. The Fill/Drain valve is mechanically opened.
The drain position switch is activated. From the drain position switch
an electrical signal will open the overflow valve, the tank drain valve
and the FWD drain valve. In the service panel the "Green FWD Drain Valve
Open Light", the "Tank Drain Valve Light", and the "Green Overflow Valve
Light" come on. Due to the opening of all valves, the system will be
drained. Most of the water will come from the tank drain and only a
small amount from fill/drain and FWD drain valve. In the service panel
the "Tank Full Light" goes off. The water quantity in the tank and the
FAP water indication decrease. The tank is empty now, the tank sensor
will trigger, so the water heater goes to off. The Fill/Drain control
handle is pushed to valve closed position.

INDICATING
The potable water tank with a capacity of 200 l (53 US gal) is installed
in the pressurized LH under floor area behind the bulk cargo
compartment.
The quantity indication system indicates how much water is available in
the potable water tank. The quantity transmitter transmits the signal to
the indicator on the water service panel. It also sends the information
to a Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B, which in turn interfaces with the
active Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) director to display
on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) the water tank contents in
percentage of volume. The TANK FULL light on the service panel comes on
when the tank is full.
PRESSURIZATION Compressed air is used to pressurize the system in order
to supply water from the tank to the necessary service locations. The
compressed air is tapped from the cross feed-line of the engine or APU
bleed air and is connected to the water tank air inlet. On ground, when
the bleed air system is not available, the ground air pressure supply
system is used. If installed, an optional compressor is used for the
pressurization in case of bleed air decrease.
DISTRIBUTION Potable water from the water tank is supplied through a
system of distribution lines, which are routed below the passenger
compartment floor. A part of the forward distribution line goes through
a hose for added protection of the avionics equipment. The potable water
distribution lines are insulated and electrically heated to prevent ice
formation in and around the lines. Each lavatory and each galley have an
individual and manual shutoff valve.
SERVICING The Servicing of the potable water system can be done with or
without electrical power. With electrical power, the single fill/drain
control handle mechanically operates the fill/overflow drain valve and
electrically controls the forward drain valve. Without electrical power,
the valves are individually operated by cables. The draining operation
is accomplished by opening the fill/overflow drain valve and the forward
drain valve. The filling operation is accomplished by opening the
fill/overflow drain valve and closing the forward drain valve. When the
tank is full, the quantity transmitter sends a signal to close the
fill/overflow drain valve automatically.
HEATING In each lavatory, a water heater is installed under the wash
basin. If the quantity transmitter detects a low level into the water
tank, it cuts the electrical supply of the water heater. A thermostat
maintains the water temperature between 45°C (113°F) and 51.7°C (125°F).
An over temperature safety device protects the heating element.

WASTE WATER SYSTEM D/O (2) GENERAL The waste water drain system discards
the waste water from the lavatory wash basins and from the galley sinks.
DRAIN ASSEMBLY Each lavatory wash basin has a drain assembly with a
valve actuated by a control knob and a cable. NOTE: The control knob is
operated by the lavatory user.
DRAIN VALVE Each drain valve opens only when a certain amount of water
is collected. This prevents a permanent loss of cabin air pressurization
through the drain lines.
DRAIN MAST In flight, differential pressure between the cabin and the
drain mast outlet discards the waste water. On ground, gravity discards
the waste water. The drain masts are electrically heated to prevent ice
formation.

TOILET SYSTEM PRINCIPLE (2) GENERAL Potable water from the aircraft
pressurized potable water system is used to flush the toilet bowl.
Differential pressure between the cabin and the atmosphere moves the
waste from the toilet bowl to the waste holding tank. This difference of
pressure can be caused by the vacuum generator or by aircraft
pressurization.
RINSE/FLUSH CONTROL A flush control unit per toilet controls the time
and sequence of the toilet operation during the flushing cycle.
VACUUM CONTROL A vacuum generator is connected to the aircraft power
circuit through the motor starting relay. As soon as a FLUSH switch is
pressed, the flush control unit sends an electrical signal, through the
connected Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B to the Cabin Intercommunication
Data System (CIDS) directors, which activates the motor starting relay
according to the altitude. The Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC) supplies
altitude data to CIDS via the System Data Acquisition Concentrator
(SDAC). At high altitude, the CPC stops the electrical supply of the
vacuum generator, the differential pressure between the cabin and the
atmosphere being sufficient to move the waste from the toilet bowl to
the waste holding tank. At low altitude or on ground, the vacuum
generator generates the necessary differential pressure.

TOILET SYSTEM DESCRIPTION (3) door limit switch signal in flight to keep
the system operational if the service panel door is open in flight.
GENERAL The toilet system removes waste from the toilet bowl through a
vacuum drain to an underfloor waste holding tank. The vacuum toilet
system is connected to the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS),
which controls and monitors the system function and the related electric
components. The system uses potable water from the potable water system
to flush the toilet.
FLUSHING When the FLUSH switch is pressed, the flush control unit
initiates the flush sequence. The vacuum generator starts to operate and
after 1.6 seconds the water valve opens for 1.7 seconds. Then, the flush
valve, controlled by the flush control unit, opens for 4 seconds to
evacuate the waste material through differential pressure.
VACUUM As soon as the FLUSH switch is pressed, the flush control unit
sends an electrical signal to the CIDS (via the connected
Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B), which operates the vacuum generator for
approximately 15 seconds. The vacuum generator creates the necessary
differential pressure between the cabin and the waste holding tank to
move the waste from the toilet bowl. The vacuum generator is
activated: - on ground, - during climb when the differential pressure is
less than 246 mbar, - during descent when the differential pressure is
less than 203 mbar. The different pressure information is supplied by
the Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC) via the System Data Acquisition
Concentrator (SDAC). NOTE: The landing gear signal is used as a back- up
in case the SDAC can not deliver altitude/ diff. press information. It
overrides the

STORAGE The waste holding tank is installed on the right hand side of
the aircraft under the floor between FRame 65 and FR 68. The tank has a
capacity of 170 l (44.9 US gal). The tank has: - a water separator, - a
liquid level transmitter (hydrostatic pressure), - a liquid level sensor
(ultrasonic type), - waste inlets, - a waste outlet, - two rinse
nozzles.
CONTROL/MONITORING The waste system data is received by DEUs B and sent
to the CIDS directors (DIRs). This system is controlled and monitored by
the Vacuum System Controller (VSC) function, which is integrated inside
the CIDS DIRs. The CIDS DIRs also report the vacuum toilet system
failures to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).
INDICATING The waste holding tank is equipped with a liquid level
transmitter and a liquid level sensor. When the tank is full, a signal
is sent to the CIDS DIRs through the DEU B,on Middle Line databus, which
shuts down the toilet systems. The signal is also sent to the Flight
Attendant Panel (FAP) through the DIRs and a "WASTE TANK NOT EMPTY-CHECK
LEVEL GROUND SERVICE REQUIRED" message is displayed.
SERVICING The waste holding tank is serviced from a service panel, which
is located on the right of the lower fuselage between FR 65 and FR 66.
It has:

-   a rinse/flush connection,
-   a waste drain valve control handle,
-   a limit switch. During servicing, the flush control units are
    automatically de-activated. Thus, toilet use is inhibited during
    servicing. The waste drain control handle mechanically operates the
    drain valve.

WATER/WASTE SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) SERVICING POTABLE WATER
SERVICING The potable water system supplies the galleys and toilets with
water from the tank via a distribution system. The tank is pressurized
by air either: - from the pneumatic system, - or from a ground cart
connected to the ground connector, - or optionally from a compressor. On
the A320 only, two valves are used for filling: - the fill/drain valve,
this is opened manually and closed electrically, - the overflow valve,
this is opened and closed electrically. Four valves are used for
draining: - the fill/drain valve, this is opened and closed manually, -
the FWD drain valve, tank drain valve and overflow valve, these are
opened and closed electrically. NOTE: On A320, if there is no electrical
power all four valves can be manually operated. On A318, A319 and A321,
one valve is used for filling: - the overflow/fill/drain valve, this is
opened manually and closed electrically. Two valves are used for
draining: - the overflow/fill/drain valve, this is manually operated, -
the FWD drain valve, this is electrically operated. NOTE: On A318, A319
and A321, if there is no electrical power both valves must be manually
operated.

WATER/WASTE SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS POTABLE WATER
SYSTEM DRAINING IN COLD WEATHER CONDITIONS In cold weather conditions,
the potable water system must be drained to prevent damage to the system
by ice. To know if it is necessary to drain the potable water system,
refer to the water system drain configuration table in the AMM 12-24-38.
If the bleed air system is off and the external air temperature is below
0 °C (32 °F), the drain valves must remain open after the potable water
system is drained to prevent damage to the potable water system. The
cold weather maintenance procedures for the potable water system are
given in the AMM 12-31-38.
