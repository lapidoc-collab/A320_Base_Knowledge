<strong>PROPULSION CONTROL SYSTEM - EIU</strong>
The EIU is an interface concentrator between the airframe and the
corresponding engine. Two EIUs are installed in the A/C.
EIU-1 interfaces with Engine 1 and EIU-2 interfaces with Engine 2.
The main functions of the EIU are:
- To concentrate data from cockpit panels and different aircraft
systems to the associated EECs on each engine,
- To ensure the segregation of the two engines,
- To give to the airframe the necessary logic and information from
engine and to other systems (APU, ECS, Bleed Air, Maintenance),
- To give to the FADEC system some necessary logic and information from
systems (example: flight/ground status).
The Fan Cowl latches of the A320 NEO are monitored by proximity switches
which send their position signals to the EIU.
The EIU transfers signals to the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) for
associated cockpit warnings based on specific logic conditions.

<strong>CONTROL AND INDICATING</strong>
This section will highlight the control panels and indications for the
engines.
<strong>CONTROL PANELS</strong>
The engines are controlled by throttle control levers which are
installed on the center pedestal. They can only be moved manually.
For reverse thrust operation, two latching levers let the throttle
control levers move rearward into the reverse thrust section.
The A320 family aircraft normally operate in the auto thrust mode, when
in flight.
The autothrust can be disconnected with an instinctive disconnect
pushbutton (2 red buttons are installed on the outside of the lever).
This lets the engines be controlled in manual thrust mode.
The controls for engine starting and shutdown are installed on the
center pedestal immediately below the throttle control levers.
The engine MAN START switches are installed on the overhead panel. These
switches are used to start an engine during a manual start procedure.
They are also used during a dry or wet motoring procedure.

<strong>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</strong>
When you work on aircraft, make sure that you obey all the Aircraft
Maintenance Manual (AMM) safety procedures.
This will prevent injury to persons and/or damage to the aircraft. Here
is an overview of main safety precautions related to the engines.
Make sure that all engine danger areas are as clear as possible to
prevent damage to the engine, the aircraft or persons in the area.
Be careful: The entry corridor will be closed when the engine power is
above the minimum.
Make sure that you have fire-fighting equipment available.
Do not try to stop the fan from turning by hand.
After engine shutdown, let the oil tank pressure bleed off for a minimum
of 5 minutes before you remove the tank filler cap. If you do not,
pressurized oil can flow out of the tank and cause dangerous burns.
The engine ignition system is an electrical system with high energy. You
must be careful to prevent electrical shock. Injury or death can occur.
Do not do maintenance on the ignition system while the engine operates.
Make sure that the engine shutdown occurred more than 5 minutes ago
before you continue with the maintenance procedure.
Make sure that the thrust reverser is deactivated during maintenance. If
not, the thrust reverser can operate accidentally and cause injury to
personnel and/or damage to the reverser.
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
When opening the engine cowls:
- Respect the wind limitations and the opening/closing sequence, NOTE:
ENTRY CORRIDOR MARKINGS
- Always secure cowls with the hold-open rods, on INBD and OUTBD
COWLINGS (Red
- Make sure that the slats are retracted and install a warning notice
to Line)
prevent slat operation.

<strong>FAN STAGE</strong>
The Fan Stage consists of the Fan Disk, 18 Fan Blades and Fan Blade
Platforms, Fan Blade Spacers, Fan Blade Locks and Fan Disk Shields.
The fan disk is titanium alloy forging and has 18 dovetail slots for
installation of fan blades. The compressor shaft supports the Fan Disk

woven composite material with leading edge in Titanium.
The composite Fan Blade Platforms are mounted between the Fan Blades to
form the flow path of the Fan Hub and to make the airflow smooth.
<strong>BOOSTER</strong>
The Booster is a three-stage axial flow compressor, consisting of
three-stage rotor spool and blades and four-stage stator vanes.
The axial-flow air compressor compresses air by accelerating the air and
then diffusing the air to obtain a pressure increase. The air is
accelerated by the three rows of rotating blades, and then diffused by a
row of vanes which converts the velocity increase to a pressure rise.

<strong>HIGH PRESSURE COMPRESSOR</strong>
The HPC is a ten-stage axial flow compressor consisting of:
- Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) Compressor Stator Vanes,
- 10 stage HPC Rotor, stages one through five are 3D-aero blade disks
(Blisks) and stage 6-10 compressor rotor spool is five rotor disks
manufactured as one component,
- 4 stage Front (Variable) Stators and Front Stator Case,
- 5 stage HPC Rear (Fixed) Stators and Aft Compressor Stator Extension
Case.
The 30 IGVs, at the inlet of the HPC, are used to convert air velocity
increase into a pressure rise and to direct air from the Booster to the
Stage 1 HPC Rotor Blades for the optimum incidence angle and converts
air velocity to air pressure.
The Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) are used to direct the air to the next
higher HPC stage. The IGVs and the VSVs are mechanically interconnected
with linkage, external to the Forward Compressor Stator Case controlled
by the EEC based on HPC rotor speed and HPC inlet temperature.
As the speed of the HPC Rotor increases, IGVs and VSVs will open; when
the speed decreases, IGVs and VSVs will tend to close.

<strong>FAN AREA</strong>
The Boost Pump pushes LP fuel through the IDG FOHX to the FMU.
The fuel passes through the Jet Pump and the strainer before leaving the
FMU and going to the Gear Pump via the Main Heat Exchanger (MHX).
The HP fuel is filtered and divided into two parts inside the Fuel
Filter.
- The main part is the fuel for combustion. It is sent to the FMU where
it is metered by the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) and sent to the SCU/SVA
via the High Pressure Shut-Off Valve (HPSOV). If a Thrust Control
Malfunction (TCM) event occurs, the Bypass Valve will reduce the amount
of fuel for combustion and mix it with the Intermediate Pressure fuel in
the Jet Pump.
- The other part is the servo fuel. It is heated by the Servo Fuel
Heater (SFH) before going to the SCU/SVA.
The Bypass Valve, FMV and HPSOV are controlled via their related Torque
Motor (TM) by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC).
The FMV is monitored directly by a dual Linear Variable Differential
Transducer (LVDT) and indirectly by the Fuel Flow Meter (FFM).
The HPSOV is monitored indirectly by the Fuel Pressure Sensor (FPS)
versus the N2 speed.
For IDG oil temperature control, the FRV mixes cold LP fuel and hot IP
fuel and modulates the return of the mixed fuel back to the aircraft
fuel tanks when necessary.
The FRV is controlled via its Torque Motor (TM) by the EEC depending on
the fuel temperature.

<strong>CORE AREA</strong>
The metered HP fuel for combustion is sent from the FMU to the SCU/SVA
and monitored by the Fuel Flow Meter and the Fuel Temperature Sensor
(FTS) on HP fuel supply line. The Pilot Metering Valve (PMV) within the
SCU shares the fuel to the three different manifolds: the Pilot
Primary/Main enriched manifold (PPMe), the Pilot Primary/Main
non-enriched manifold (PPMne) and the Pilot secondary manifold (Psec).
The PMV is controlled by the EEC via its TM and monitored by its LVDT.
Fuel split is used to optimize the Twin Annular Premixing Swirler (TAPS)
combustor efficiency and emissions according to preset parameters.
The pressure in the PPMe leg is monitored by the Fuel Pressure Sensor.
The HP servo fuel is directed to the seven TMs within the SVA, directly
or via the Regulator.
They provide fuel muscle pressure to the Engine Air System actuators: 1
pair for Variable Stator Vane (VSV), 1 pair for Variable Bleed Valve
(VBV), 1 pair for Modulated Turbine Cooling (MTC), 1 for High Pressure
Turbine Active Clearance Control (HPTACC), 1 for Low Pressure Turbine
Active Clearance Control (LPTACC), 1 for Transient Bleed Valve (TBV) and
1 for Start Bleed/Booster Anti-Ice Valve (SB/BAIV).
A pickup on the supply line to the SVA provides the muscle pressure to
the three FMU Torque Motors and to the FRV Torque Motor.

<strong>STARTING</strong>
When the Master Lever is set to ON, the LPSOV opens, the EEC is
energized and commands the HPSOV to unlatch via the Over Speed /
Shut Off Torque Motor (OS/SO TM).
During starting, the Boost Pump pressurizes the fuel at low pressure and
sends it through the IDG FOHX to the FMU. The fuel passes through the
Jet Pump and the strainer of the FMU before going through the MHX.
At this point, the Gear Pump pressurizes the fuel at high pressure and
sends to the Fuel Filter where it is split into fuel for combustion and
servo fuel. The fuel for combustion is sent back to the FMU.
The EEC opens the FMV and lets the fuel to flow to the HPSOV which also
opens when the pressure is enough and sends fuel to the SCU/SVA via the
FFM and the FTS.
The EEC controls the PMV to supply the PPMe and PPMne manifolds up to
idle. Above idle, the Psec manifold is also supplied.
In parallel, the servo fuel is sent to the SCU/SVA Regulator and Torque
Motors via the SFH.

<strong>SHUTDOWN</strong>
NORMAL SHUTDOWN:
During a normal engine shutdown on ground, the Master Lever controls the
LPSOV to close and sends a shutdown signal to the EEC.
As a consequence, the EEC first initiates a Thrust Control Malfunction
Accommodation (TCMA)/OS Fuel Shutoff test and then activates the SO
function to control the HPSOV to close.
The EEC commands the FMV to close \~1.5 seconds after the Master Lever
transitions to OFF.
OVERSPEED SHUTDOWN:
Each EEC has two independent switches that monitor the N2 speed. One
switch uses the speed signal form the Permanent Magnet Alternator (PMA),
while the other switch uses the speed signal from the N2 sensor.
Both switches must close to shut down the engine. The overspeed system
in both EEC is always active regardless of which EEC is in control.
When an OS condition is detected, both switches are simultaneously
activated and lead to a TCMA/OS Fuel Shutoff command causing the HPSOV
to close and be hydraulically latched.

<strong>FUEL INDICATING</strong>
The engine fuel indicating monitors the system condition and provides
the system status to the cockpit displays.
The Fuel Flow Meter sends signals to the EECs to compute the fuel flow
to the combustor.
The fuel flow is a primary engine parameter and is displayed on the
Engine/Warning Display (EWD) permanently. The EEC also sends this data
for the fuel used computation and display on the System Display (SD).
The Fuel Filter Differential Pressure (FFDP) sensor measures the
differential pressure across the fuel filter.
This helps to detect if the filter is partially or totally clogged.
According to the received value, the EECs will generate various warnings
on the EWD: ENG X FUEL FILTER DEGRAD or ENG X FUEL
FILTER CLOG or ENG X FUEL SENSOR FAULT and on the SD: CLOG.
The Fuel Strainer Differential Pressure (FSDP) sensor is used to sense
the differential pressure across the FMU fuel strainer.
According to the received value, the EECs will generate various warnings
on the EWD: ENG X FUEL STRAINER CLOG or ENG X FUEL
SENSOR FAULT.
The Fuel Temperature sensor is used by the EECs for the Weight of Fuel
Metered (WFM) calculation and for the Fuel Return Valve control.
If it fails, the EECs will generate the following warning on the EWD:
ENG X FUEL SENSOR FAULT - TEMP SENSORS.
The Fuel Pressure sensor is used by the EECs to determine the HPSOV, FMV
and Bypass Valve position for monitoring, computation and fault
annunciation.
If it fails, the EECs will generate the following warning on the EWD:
ENG X FADEC SYS FAULT.

<strong>ENGINE INTERFACE UNIT</strong>
There are 2 EIUs per aircraft, one per engine.
The EIU ensures the segregation of the 2 engines and aircraft electrical
power supply to the FADEC.
Each EIU is an interface concentrator between the airframe and the
corresponding Engine EEC A &amp; EEC B.
There is a single EIU input into the EEC A cross connected to EEC B
but both EECs transfer engine data to the EIU.
If EEC A fails, EEC B receives airframe input through the cross channel
data link.
The EIU concentrates data from or to the cockpit panels and displays
(also Flaps and slats lever position).
It gives logics and information to or from other aircraft systems as
Flight/Ground from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) or
Environmental Control System (ECS) pressure demand from Air Conditioning
System Controllers (ACSCs).
For engine maintenance, the PCS is connected to the Centralized Fault
Display System (CFDIU) and Multipurpose Control Display Unit (MCDU)
for BITE information via the EIU.
The EIU is normally active as a minimum, from the engine starting up to
the engine shutdown. The EIU is dispatch critical.

<strong>FADEC</strong>
<strong>EECs</strong>
On each engine, the FADEC consists in a two EECs: A and B with
crosstalk, a PSS and sensors used for control and monitoring.
Each EEC, channel A and channel B, has the capability to control the
engine systems based upon the Throttle Level Angle (TLA) from the
aircraft.
Only one EEC at a time will operate the engine valves, actuators and
solenoids. This EEC is called the \"channel in control\" or the \"active
channel.\" The other EEC will be \"standby\" or \"inactive.\"
The EEC in control switches during engine start if equally healthy.
<strong>PSS</strong>
The PSS receives engine air pressure measurements and converts them into
electrical signals to both EECs for engine control and monitoring.
The Data Entry Plug (DEP) attached to the engine is connected to the
PSS, thus communicated to the EECs.

<strong>POWER MANAGEMENT</strong>
The FADEC system manages the engine thrust and optimizes the
performance.
The EEC uses air data parameters from Air Data/Inertial Reference System
(ADIRS) for rating calculations.
The FADEC manages power according to two thrust modes:
- manual mode depending on TLA,
- automatic thrust mode depending on autothrust function generated by
the Auto Flight System (AFS = FMGC/FCU).
The FADEC also provides two idle mode selections: minimum idle and
approach idle.
If the aircraft is on ground and extend the slats the engine will stay
at minimum idle but in flight it will go to approach idle. The idle can
also be modulated up to approach idle depending on: Air conditioning
demand, wing anti-ice demand, engine anti-ice demand and oil temperature
(for Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) cooling).
EEC needs to receive the EPGS Load from GCU for engine performance
optimization and the EEC provides speed information to the Generator
Control Unit (GCU) for Under-Speed (US) set point, control and
protection.

<strong>ENGINE LIMIT PROTECTION</strong>
The FADEC provides thrust parameter limit computation thus ensuring
engine integrity protection.
The FADEC system incorporates hardware and/or software limits to prevent
over-boosting or overspeed of the engine. Limit protection is provided
for fan speed, core speed, fuel flow and combustor pressure.
In addition, during sub-idle operation, the FADEC system will prevent
the engine from exceeding starting EGT temperature limits.
The TCMA logic on the LEAP-1A engine identifies if the engine is not
responding the throttle command and takes mitigating action if required.
In case of a Thrust Control Malfunction (TCM) event, the TCMA reduces
the thrust by reducing the quantity of metered fuel flow or shut-down
the engine on ground (HPSOV closed) as commanded by the EEC.
A TCM Overthrust event may be caused by the following:
- The throttle lever assembly,
- The throttle lever position resolvers,
- A spurious EEC command to the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV),
- A physical failure of the FMV.
A loss of TCMA shutoff capability is detected when the relay controlled
by the Spoiler and Elevator Computer (SEC) is Failed Open.

<strong>ENGINE SYSTEM CONTROL</strong>
<strong>STARTING AND IGNITION</strong>
The FADEC controls the engine start sequence in automatic or manual mode
when initiated from the control panels; those signals are transmitted
via the EIU. But there is a direct discrete input to the EEC
from the Master Switch OFF position.
The EECs monitor N1, N2, EGT and oil parameters and then can abort or
recycle an engine start.
<strong>ENGINE SUB-SYSTEMS</strong>
The FADEC provides optimal engine operation in compatibility with
Aircraft Systems by controlling:
- combustor metering valve and fuel flow,
- compressor airflow and turbine case cooling,
- forward and Reverse thrust settings; the Reverser Tertiary Lock
System switching control is performed by the SEC,
- thermal management (oil cooling, fuel heating),
- control and monitoring sensors,
- BITE (fault detection, isolation, annunciation and transmission to
the aircraft),
- nacelle anti-ice.

FADEC inputs or outputs are transmitted on a digital, analog or discrete
format.
The 2 EECs exchange data externally using a Cross Channel Data Link
(CCDL).
Any time the engine is operating and both EECs are equally healthy; each
EEC is constantly monitoring the inputs of the Pressure Sub-System (PSS)
box, engine sensors, probes, position feedbacks, thrust reverser, and
aircraft inputs.
Each EEC also monitors its own outputs and internal operation for proper
operation.
Each EEC unit has 9 connectors:
- J1 not used,
- J2 &amp; J4 for data exchange with A/C,
- J3 for the Permanent Magnet Alternator (PMA),
- J5 to J8 for data exchange with engine components,
- J9 used for ground test (capped during normal engine operation).

Each EEC uses inputs provided by the PSS, engine sensors, probes, and
information from the aircraft computers, switches, and controls.
Each EEC processes this information and performs calculations of, and
comparisons to, information stored in its memory.
The EEC \"channel in control\" adjusts the engine valves, actuators, and

- external pneumatic ground cart,
engine starting, cranking, and ignition selection, on ground and in
flight.
- engine bleed from the opposite engine.
For engine starting, two modes are available; automatic or manual.
Both modes can be used on ground or in flight but the in-flight
sequences are less protective to enhance the restart capability.
For engine cranking, two sequences can be manually selected: dry or wet.
Each Electronic Engine Control (EEC) can control the starting and
ignition components according to cockpit commands and protective logics.
The main engine parameters to be monitored during starting are displays
on the Engine/Warning Display (E/WD) (N1, EGT, N2, Fuel Flow) and on the

position and available pneumatic pressure).
There are two separate redundant ignition systems per engine. Each
system is made up of one ignition exciter, one ignition lead and one
igniter plug. Each of the two plugs and corresponding circuits can be
used both at the same time or alternately to detect dormant failures.
The Engine Interface Unit (EIU) supplies 115 Volt power supply to both
EECs for ignition.
The EECs control the ignition via internal high voltage relays to supply
115 VAC to the ignition exciters.
The starting system consists of a SAV, Starter Air Duct (SAD) and an Air
Turbine Starter (ATS).
The SAV is a butterfly valve, electrically controlled by the EECs and
pneumatically operated.
The SAV operation is monitored by the EECs by means of a dual pressure
sensor.
The ATS is attached to the front of the Accessory Gearbox (AGB) at the 7
o\'clock position. It is controlled and monitored by the EECs according
to the engine speed.

<strong>ENGINE CRANK</strong>
<strong>DRY CRANK</strong>
Cranking function is used to motor the engine on the ground for a short
time with the use of the starter.
There are two cranking modes:
- dry cranking,
- wet cranking.
The dry cranking procedure is used to motor the engine to remove
unburned fuel from the combustion chamber or cool down the engine or for
some fuel or oil leak tests.
The EEC shall enter the engine dry crank sequence when all of the
following conditions are true:
- the engine is not running and,
- the aircraft is on ground and,
- the rotary selector is set to CRANK.
This will power up the EECs and isolate both ignition systems.
The ENGINE page appears automatically on the ECAM SD.
When the ENG MAN START P/B is set to ON, the EEC commands the SAV to
open.
The dry motoring can be interrupted at any time by pushing the ENG
MAN START pushbutton to OFF or positioning the ENG MODE
rotary selector to NORM position.
The usual starter duty cycle is 3 starter crank cycles or 5 minutes
maximum of continuous cranking. A 30 minutes cool down period is
necessary for additional use.
WARNING: the EEC is able to initiate a start sequence immediately

<strong>ENGINE CRANK (continued)</strong>
<strong>WET CRANK</strong>
The wet cranking procedure is used to motor the engine for specific fuel
leak tests.
The fuel flow is commanded but both ignition systems are isolated.
The fuel goes through the FMU and the SCU/SVA to the actuator fuel
pressure lines, the engine fuel manifolds (primary fuel lines only), and
nozzles. Fuel is then sprayed in the combustion chamber.
The first steps of the wet crank sequence are the same as the ones for
the dry crank:
- the engine is not running,
- the aircraft is on ground,
- the rotary selector is set to CRANK (EECs powered, both ignition
systems isolated, ENGINE page appears),
- the ENG MAN START P/B is set to ON (SAV opening).
When N2 speed stabilizes, the ENG MASTER lever is set to the ON
position to command the fuel flow.
After 15 seconds, the ENG MASTER lever is set to the OFF position to cut
the fuel supply.
The SAV command is maintained 30 seconds to blow all the fuel from the
engine.
The wet motoring ends by pushing the ENG MAN START pushbutton to OFF
or/and positioning the ENG MODE rotary selector to NORM
position.

- Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) bleed,
The FADEC controls and monitors the Starting and Ignition systems for
- external pneumatic ground cart,
engine starting, cranking, and ignition selection, on ground and in
flight.
- engine bleed from the opposite engine.
For engine starting, two modes are available; automatic or manual.
Both modes can be used on ground or in flight but the in-flight
sequences are less protective to enhance the restart capability.
For engine cranking, two sequences can be manually selected: dry or wet.
Each Electronic Engine Control (EEC) can control the starting and
ignition components according to cockpit commands and protective logics.
The main engine parameters to be monitored during starting are displays
on the Engine/Warning Display (E/WD) (N1, EGT, N2, Fuel Flow) and on the
System Display (SD) (Oil Press, IGN system, Starter Air Valve (SAV)
position and available pneumatic pressure).
There are two separate redundant ignition systems per engine. Each
system is made up of one ignition exciter, one ignition lead and one
igniter plug. Each of the two plugs and corresponding circuits can be
used both at the same time or alternately to detect dormant failures.
The Engine Interface Unit (EIU) supplies 115 Volt power supply to both
EECs for ignition.
The EECs control the ignition via internal high voltage relays to supply
115 VAC to the ignition exciters.
The starting system consists of a SAV, Starter Air Duct (SAD) and an Air
Turbine Starter (ATS).
The SAV is a butterfly valve, electrically controlled by the EECs and
pneumatically operated.
The SAV operation is monitored by the EECs by means of a dual pressure
sensor.
The ATS is attached to the front of the Accessory Gearbox (AGB) at the 7
o\'clock position. It is controlled and monitored by the EECs according
to the engine speed.

DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3)
<strong>COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL</strong>
<strong>VARIABLE BLEED VALVES SYSTEM</strong>
To increase the booster surge margin, part of the primary airflow is
bled into the secondary gas path, through the Variable Bleed Valves
(VBV) system.
The system is made of eight VBV door assemblies, one actuating ring and
two VBV actuators.
Both actuators are hydraulically operated simultaneously by servo fuel
from one dedicated Torque Motor (TM) in the Split Control Unit
/ Servo Valve Assembly (SCU/SVA). The TM is electrically controlled by
the EEC in control, according to control parameters. Both actuators are
mechanically connected to the actuating ring via bell cranks.
When the head chambers of the pistons are pressurized, the rods extent
and the VBV doors open intrusively into the primary airflow to bypass
part of the booster discharge via the VBV ducts into the fan air flow.
Each EEC receives one actuator position feedback via the actuator
integrated single channel Linear Variable Differential Transducer
(LVDT). The other one is exchanged by both EECs via the Cross Channel
Data Link (CCDL).

<strong>COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL (continued)</strong> <strong>VARIABLE STATOR VANES
SYSTEM</strong>
The Variable Stator Vane (VSV) system positions the first five HP
Compressor stages of variable stator vanes to control the amount of
airflow through the HP Compressor, in order to provide optimum
compressor performance and to prevent compressor stall.
The system is made of two VSV actuators, two bell crank assemblies, five
actuation rings and five set of VSVs including lever arms (from Inlet
Guide Vanes (IGVs) to High Pressure Compressor (HPC) 4th stage).
Both actuators are hydraulically operated simultaneously by servo fuel
from one dedicated TM in the SCU/SVA. The TM is electrically controlled
by the EEC in control, according to control parameters.
Both actuators are mechanically linked.
The linear motion of the actuators is converted in rotating displacement
of the vanes through the bell cranks, actuation rings and lever arms.
Each EEC receives one actuator position feedback via the actuator
integrated single channel LVDT. The other one is exchanged by both EECs
via the CCDL.

<strong>COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL (continued)</strong> <strong>START BLEED AND BOOSTER
ANTI-ICE SYSTEM</strong>
The Start Bleed/Booster Anti Ice (SB/BAI) system bleeds 7th stage air
from the HP compressor during transient starting conditions in order to
improve the starting performances or to provide heating air to the
booster during icing conditions.
The Start Bleed/Booster Anti Ice Valve (SB/BAIV) consists of a single
inlet (7th stage) and two outlets. An internal ball mechanism directs
air through the two exit ports: one to the core compartment for start
bleed function and the other one to the flow splitter leading edge for
booster anti-ice function.
For BAI, the HPC 7th air pickup is ducted by several hoses to the flow
splitter, which includes notches for hot gas evacuation to the outer
surface.
For SB, the bleed air exits the valve and is vented through a pepper pot
device that diffuses the air under the cowling in the core area.
The SB/BAIV actuator is hydraulically operated by servo fuel from one
dedicated TM in the SCU/SVA. The TM is electrically controlled by the
EEC in control, according to preset parameters.
A dual channel Rotary Variable Differential Transducer (RVDT), inside
the rotary fuel actuator, provides valve position feedback to both EECs.

<strong>COOLING</strong>
<strong>HPT &amp; LPT ACTIVE CLEARANCE CONTROL SYSTEM</strong>
The HPTACC and LPTACC system regulates airflow to the exterior of the
high and low pressure turbine cases. The cooling air is used to optimize
the clearances between the cases and the rotor blades in order to
decrease the specific fuel consumption. Fan air enters the circuit
through a louver and is split in two sub-circuits where it is metered by
each ACC individual valve.
The HPTACC and LPTACC valves are two separate, but identical,
butterfly-type valves. Each valve actuator is hydraulically operated by
servo fuel from one dedicated TM in the SCU/SVA. The TM is electrically
controlled by the EEC in control, according to preset parameters.
A dual channel LVDT, inside each fuel actuator, provides valve position
feedback to both EECs.
NOTE:
The actuator extension chamber is supplied by modulated servo fuel
whereas the rod chamber is supplied by regulated High Pressure fuel.

<strong>COOLING (continued)</strong>
<strong>MODULATED TURBINE COOLING SYSTEM</strong>
The Modulated Turbine Cooling (MTC) system reduces the HPT
turbine blades cooling at low power in order to limit air leaks and to
decrease the specific fuel consumption.
The cooling flow from the HPC 10th stage to the HPT 1st stage turbine
blades is increased by the opening of the two MTC Valves (MTCVs) at high
power.
The MTCVs are two independent plunger-type valves connected to their
respective actuator via a push/pull rod linkage mechanism. Both valve
actuators are hydraulically operated simultaneously by servo fuel from
one dedicated TM in the SCU/SVA. The TM is electrically controlled by
the EEC in control, according to preset parameters. The actuators are
commanded fully open or fully closed.
Each EEC receives one valve position feedback via the actuator
integrated single channel LVDT. The other one is exchanged by both EECs
via the CCDL.

<strong>FAN COMPARTMENT AND ACCESSORY COOLING</strong>
The fan compartment cooling is achieved through a passive ventilation
system with external air. When the aircraft is moving, the airflow is
circulated from the top ventilation scoop to the ventilation grids and
split line at the bottom of the fan cowl.
The Fan Overheat Detector system monitors the fan area for any excessive
temperature due to a bleed air leak and sends the corresponding signal
to the EECs. There are two dual sensors in the fan case, one at the 12
o\'clock position next to the starter duct and the other at the 6
o\'clock position next to the Nacelle Anti-Icing (NAI) duct.

<strong>COOLING (continued)</strong>
<strong>EEC COOLING</strong>
The EEC Cooling system provides additional dedicated cooling to both
EECs in specific conditions. Otherwise the fan compartment ventilation
is sufficient to cool down the EECs.
The EEC cooling system consists of two blowers installed in parallel,
which pull outside air through the static grid into the EEC plenums.
The flow is then exhausted in the fan compartment via EEC air outlets.
When any EEC detects an internal high temperature on ground, it sends
the demand to the EIU that controls an independent power supply relay to
power both blowers. Each EEC receives one blower speed sensor signal for
confirmation.
Each blower is fitted with an electronic control system, thermal
protections and an outlet check valve.

<strong>CONTROL AND INDICATING</strong>
This section will highlight the control panels and indications for the
engines.
<strong>CONTROL PANELS</strong>
The engines are controlled by throttle control levers which are
installed on the center pedestal. They can only be moved manually.
For reverse thrust operation, two latching levers let the throttle
control levers move rearward into the reverse thrust section.
The A320 family aircraft normally operate in the auto thrust mode, when
in flight.
The autothrust can be disconnected with an instinctive disconnect
pushbutton (2 red buttons are installed on the outside of the lever).
This lets the engines be controlled in manual thrust mode.
The controls for engine starting and shutdown are installed on the
center pedestal immediately below the throttle control levers.
The engine MAN START switches are installed on the overhead panel. These
switches are used to start an engine during a manual start procedure.
They are also used during a dry or wet motoring procedure.

<strong>THROTTLE CONTROL LEVER</strong>
The throttle control handle comprises:
- A throttle control lever which incorporates stop devices, autothrust
instinctive disconnect pushbutton switch,
- A graduated fixed sector,
- A reverse latching lever.
The throttle control lever is linked to a mechanical rod.
This rod drives the input lever of the throttle control artificial feel
unit.
The throttle control lever moves over a range from -20 deg.Throttle
Lever Angle (TLA) to +45 deg.TLA:
-20 degrees TLA corresponds to Reverser Full Throttle stop,
+45 degrees TLA corresponds to Forward Full Throttle stop.
The intermediate mechanical stop (Idle) is set to 0 deg.TLA.
This stop is overridden when the reverse latching lever is pulled up for
selection of the reverse power.
This stop is reset as soon as the throttle control lever is selected
back to forward thrust area.
In the forward thrust area, there are two detent points, the MAX CLIMB
detent point set at 25 deg.TLA and the MAX CONTINUOUS/FLEX
TAKE-OFF detent point set at 35 deg.TLA.
In the reverse thrust throttle range; there is one detent point at -6
deg.TLA.
This position agrees with the selection of the thrust reverser command
and the Reverse Idle setting.
In the middle throttle range (0 deg. to 35 deg.TLA), the autothrust
function can be active if engaged. This range agrees with the selection
of MAX
CLIMB or MAX CONTINUOUS thrust limit mode (in single operation).
If the autothrust is not engaged, the engine control is manual.
In the forward range (35 deg. to 45 deg.TLA), the autothrust function
cannot be activated (except in alpha floor condition).
This range agrees with the selection of FLEX TAKE-OFF/MAX
TAKE-OFF (GO AROUND) Mode.

<strong>THROTTLE CONTROL UNIT</strong>
A mechanical rod transmits the throttle control lever movement. It
connects the throttle artificial feel unit to the input lever of the
throttle control unit. Each throttle control unit comprises:
- An input lever,
- Mechanical stops, which limit the angular range,
- 2 resolvers (one resolver per Electronic Engine Control (EEC)),
- 6 potentiometers (which send signals to Spoiler Elevator Computers
(SECs) 1, 2 and3),
- A device, which drives the resolver and the potentiometer,
- A pin device for rigging the resolvers and potentiometers,
- 1 switch whose signal is dedicated to the Engine Interface Unit
(EIU),
- 2 output electrical connectors.
The input lever drives two gear sectors assembled face to face. Each
sector drives a set of resolvers and potentiometers.
The relationship between the Throttle Lever Angle (TLA) and Throttle
Resolver Angle (TRA) is linear and (1 deg.TLA = 1.9 TRA).
The accuracy of the throttle control unit (error between the input lever
position and the resolver angle) is 0.5 deg.TRA.
The maximum discrepancy between the signals generated by two resolvers
is 0.25 deg.TRA.
The TLA resolver operates in two quadrants. The first quadrant is used
for positive angles and the second quadrant for negative angles.
Each resolver is dedicated to one EEC and receives its electrical
excitation current (6V AC) from the related EEC.
The EECs consider, as a resolver position signal failure, a throttle
resolver angle value less than -47.5 deg. or greater than 98.8 deg.
They include a resolver fault accommodation logic. This logic allows
engine operation after a failure or a complete loss of the throttle
resolver position signal.

<strong>BUMP FUNCTION (OPTION)</strong>
The BUMP function can be activated by the pilot to require an additional
thrust during Take-Off and Go-Around due to environmental conditions
(Take Off distance available, Maximum A/C payload, ambient temperature,
ambient pressure).
This function is armed on ground by pressing one of the two \"guarded\"
push buttons installed on the thrust levers.
Each push button position signal is transmitted to both EIU and then to
the associated EECs.
The bump arming is displayed to the flight crew on the upper ECAM
display (close to the N1 dial for each engine) through the display of a
\"B\" character. In case of a failure of the Bump function following its
activation, the \"B\" character is no longer displayed.
The Bump function can be armed on ground.
Once the bump is armed, and if the throttle lever is set above the
FLEX/MCT position, Take-Off bump is active when all the specific
following conditions are met:
- Throttle Lever in Take Off position,
- Engine core speed above 50%.
The bump function is disarmed (so deactivated):
- as soon as the thrust is reduced and the throttle lever is below
FLEX/MCT position,
- or by pressing again the push button,
- or if the aircraft is confirmed on ground,
- or if the Master Lever is set to OFF.
There is no automatic reactivation in case of Go-Around selection.

(EOSV TM and Shut Off Solenoid Valve (SOSV)) to the close position
<strong>THRUST CONTROL MALFUNCTION ACCOMMODATION</strong>
in order to stop the fuel flow and shut down the engine.
The intent of Thrust Control Malfunction Accommodation (TCMA) logic is
to identify if the engine is not responding the throttle command and
take mitigating action if required.
In flight, mainly during flare and landing phases, if the engine control
is affected (engine thrust is higher than the throttle command), a TCMA
cutback sequence is applied.
On ground, if the engine control is affected (engine thrust does not
response to throttle command, for instance when idle is requested during
a rejected take-off), a TCMA shutdown sequence is applied.
The EEC shall enable the fuel cutback function when:
- Fan speed (N1) is greater than Thrust Control Malfunction (TCM)
threshold,
- Pressure altitude below 15,000 ft,
- Mach number less than 0.40.
NOTE:
The EECs use TCMA logic data from FMGCs to Flight Control Unit (FCU) to
automatically reduce engine thrust (cutback) during flare.
The EEC shall enable the fuel shutoff function when:
- Fan speed (N1) is greater than TCMA threshold or TCMA cutback already
applied,
- Pressure altitude below 15,000 ft,
- Mach number less than 0.40,
- The EEC receives a valid \"aircraft on-ground\" signal,
- Throttle is at or below idle.
A fuel cutback is achieved by a fuel flow reduction via the TCMA Torque
Motor (TM) that opens the Bypass valve in order to decrease the fuel
flow and the engine thrust to a pre-set value.
A fuel shutdown is achieved by the control of the Hugh Pressure Shut-Off
Valve (HPSOV) via the Engine Over Speed (EOS) shutdown hardware

<strong>FUEL INDICATING</strong>
The engine fuel indicating monitors the system condition and provides
the system status to the cockpit displays.
The Fuel Flow Meter sends signals to the EECs to compute the fuel flow
to the combustor.
The fuel flow is a primary engine parameter and is displayed on the
Engine/Warning Display (EWD) permanently. The EEC also sends this data
for the fuel used computation and display on the System Display (SD).
The Fuel Filter Differential Pressure (FFDP) sensor measures the
differential pressure across the fuel filter.
This helps to detect if the filter is partially or totally clogged.
According to the received value, the EECs will generate various warnings
on the EWD: ENG X FUEL FILTER DEGRAD or ENG X FUEL
FILTER CLOG or ENG X FUEL SENSOR FAULT and on the SD: CLOG.
The Fuel Strainer Differential Pressure (FSDP) sensor is used to sense
the differential pressure across the FMU fuel strainer.
According to the received value, the EECs will generate various warnings
on the EWD: ENG X FUEL STRAINER CLOG or ENG X FUEL
SENSOR FAULT.
The Fuel Temperature sensor is used by the EECs for the Weight of Fuel
Metered (WFM) calculation and for the Fuel Return Valve control.
If it fails, the EECs will generate the following warning on the EWD:
ENG X FUEL SENSOR FAULT - TEMP SENSORS.
The Fuel Pressure sensor is used by the EECs to determine the HPSOV, FMV
and Bypass Valve position for monitoring, computation and fault
annunciation.
If it fails, the EECs will generate the following warning on the EWD:
ENG X FADEC SYS FAULT.

<strong>THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM LAYOUT</strong>
The thrust reverser system is of the aerodynamic blockage type.
For each engine, it consists of two translating sleeves linked
mechanically, ten blocker doors and twenty cascade vanes to redirect fan
discharge airflow.
Each Thrust Reverser Actuation System (TRAS) is pressurized by its
dedicated hydraulic power source:
- the green hydraulic pressure for engine 1,
- the yellow one for engine 2.
Each system is made of:
- one Isolation Control Unit (ICU) and a Directional Control Unit
(DCU),
- two worm drive actuators per side (on the RH side, one
Synchronization Locking Feedback Actuator (SLFA) and one Synchronization
Manual Locking Actuator (SMLA); on the LH side, one SLFA and one
Synchronization Non Locking Actuator (SNLA)),
- three synchronization flex shafts,
- locking and monitoring devices.
To avoid inadvertent deployment in flight, the system operates under
multiple and independent commands of various components. It comprises
three lines of defense: the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) control on the
ICU and DCU, the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) control on the ICU
and DCU, and Spoiler Elevator Computer (SEC) control on the Electrical
Tertiary Lock (ETL).
Each computer receives the throttle position independently from a
dedicated sensor and the EECs and EIU are able to cross check the
various inputs.
The system also comprises three retention means: one primary lock in
each upper actuator (SLFA) and one ETL at the bottom of the left
translating sleeve.
The translating sleeves position is monitored by the SLFA Linear
Variable Differential Transducers (LVDTs) and the retention means
(locks) are monitored by their related dual proximity sensor.

running. The thrust reversers are stowed, locked and not inhibited.
In these conditions:
- the ICU, DCU, Electrical Tertiary Lock (ETL) are de-energized to
prevent pressurization,
- the 3 dual proximity sensors indicate locked,
- the ICU pressure switch indicates a low pressure,
- both LVDTs indicate a stowed condition,
- the ICU inhibition lever proximity sensor indicates a non-inhibited
condition.
When the thrust-reverser lever is set to the deploy position, the
following sequence occurs.
As soon as the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) receive the signal from
the Throttle Control Unit (TCU) potentiometers (Throttle Lever Angle
(TLA) \&lt; -3°), and from the Radio Altimeter (RA) (altitude \&lt; 6 ft),
they control the powering of the ETL to open for 40 seconds.
When the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) receives the signals from the TCU
switch (TLA \&lt; -3.8°) and from the Landing Gear Control and Interface
Units (LGCIUs) (aircraft on ground), it controls the closure of internal
relays involved in the ICU and DCU powering.
When the EEC receives the signals from the TCU resolvers (TLA \&lt;
-4.3°), it closes an internal relay to power the ICU to open. The
pressure is sent to the actuators rod chambers to perform an overstow in
order to release internal friction on primary locks prior unlocking.
When the EEC receives the pressurization signal from the ICU pressure
switch and the unlocked signal from the ETL proximity sensor, it closes
an internal relay to power the DCU to open. The pressure is sent to the
actuators jack heads to release the actuators internal primary locks and
command the translating sleeves deployment.
One second after the SLFA LVDTs indicate 85 % of travel, the EEC
commands the engine to accelerate from reverse idle to max reverse

<strong>STOW SEQUENCE</strong>
When the thrust-reverser lever is set to the stow position, the
following sequence occurs.
When the EEC and the EIU receive the signals from the TCU to confirm the
idle selection, they first de-energize the DCU and then the EEC closes
its internal contact to re-open the ICU. The pressure is sent to the
actuators rod chambers to stow the translating sleeves.
The EEC will limit the engine thrust to selected forward idle mode until
the Thrust Reverser is confirmed locked.
When reaching the end of retraction, the ETL is re-engaged first
mechanically by the roller on the left translating sleeve, then the two
primary locks are re-engaged when reaching the overstow position.
2 seconds after the overstow position is detected by the LVDTs, the EEC
de-energizes the ICU to release the pressure in the actuators. Then the
EIU opens its internal relay to isolate the ICU powering. The TRAS is
de-pressurized.

<strong>OIL SUPPLY</strong>
Oil flows from the pressurized oil tank to the dual lube pump in the
Lubrication Unit.
The inlet on the Lubrication Unit is fitted with an Anti Leakage Valve
(ALV) to avoid oil to flow by gravity from the tank to the Lube Unit and
end up in the Accessory Gearbox (AGB).
The pressurized oil is directed to the supply oil filter and then to the
heat exchangers via a Non Return Valve (NRV).
The NRV prevents oil from draining from heat exchangers (located above
the supply pump) down to the AGB through the Lube Unit.
The oil is cooled down when passing through the SFH, the SACOCs and the
MHX.
The Oil Pressurizing Valve (OPV) at the oil outlet of the MHX, enables
pressurized oil to feed the engine oil dampers.

<strong>OIL SCAVENGE &amp; VENTING</strong>
The engine oil scavenge system is used to return the hot lubrication oil
to the tank through the Lubrication Unit.
The Lubrication Unit has five scavenge pumps that are used to pull
scavenge oil from the sumps (A, B and C) and the gearboxes (TGB and
AGB). To protect the scavenge pumps from large debris potentially
generated within engine sumps, strainers are installed in the Lube Unit
upstream each pump. A provision for magnetic chip detectors installation
is also included in the strainer assemblies.
The scavenged line is connected to the oil tank through the deaerator: a
static air/oil separator. It is fitted with a Tank Pressure Valve (TPV)
and an Oil Debris Monitoring Sensor (ODMS).
The mist of air and oil is centrifugally separated. The oil is directed
to the ODMS and then collected in the tank, whereas part of the air is
used to pressurize the tank and the excess is vented to the AGB thanks
to the TPV.

<strong>SUMP PRESSURIZATION</strong>
Sump sealing is performed by contact carbon seals and sump
pressurization is made by air pickup downstream LP Compressor (stage
25). Both are necessary to avoid oil leakage.
At low engine speed, pressure level in stage 25 is not sufficient to
ensure proper A sump sealing. An Eductor Valve (EV) is therefore used to
control engine A sump pressurization by providing HPC 7th stage air to
an eductor tube in the Center Vent Tube (CVT) venturi in order to
increase differential pressure across forward sump seals.
The EV is an inlet pressure (HPC 7) controlled, altitude compensated
poppet style shutoff valve, it opens at low pressure and closes when the
pressure increases.

<strong>OIL MONITORING AND INDICATING</strong>
<strong>OIL FILTER DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE</strong>
The dual OFDP sensor is installed on the Lube Unit, adjacent to the The
oil monitoring and indicating system comprises: oil filter.
- Oil Level (OL) indicating,
- Oil Debris Monitoring (ODM),
- Oil Pressure and Temperature (OPT) indicating,
- Low Oil Pressure (LOP) indicating,
- 'The signal is sent to both EEC channels.' .
<strong>OIL LEVEL INDICATING</strong>
The Oil Level Sensor (OLS) is installed on the top of the oil tank.
It is of the magnetic float and reed switch type. The signal
proportional to the oil level is sent to the EEC channel A.
<strong>OIL DEBRIS MONITORING</strong>
The ODMS is installed in the deaerator of the oil tank.
It is a passive, magnetic, inductive sensor. It collects ferrous
particles and generates an electrical signal whose amplitude depends on
particle size. The signal is processed by the ODMU and sent to the EEC
channel B.
<strong>OIL PRESSURE &amp; TEMPERATURE INDICATING</strong>
The dual OPT sensor is installed on the AGB upper front face.
It measures:
- the differential pressure between the AGB oil supply and the oil-air
mixture within AGB sump and,
- the oil temperature at the AGB oil supply inlet, The OPT sends the
signals to both EEC channels.
<strong>LOW OIL PRESSURE INDICATING</strong>
The low oil pressure switch is installed on the fan case.
It detects low oil pressure condition on the oil supply line downstream
of the MHX and sends the signals to the Engine Interface Unit (EIU).

MAINTENANCE (LEAP) <strong>ENGINE OIL SERVICING</strong>
CAUTION: The engine should be shut down for at least 5 minutes prior to
oil servicing. This allows the residual pressure in the oil tank to
decrease. If you open the filler cap when there is pressure in the tank
the hot oil can spray out and burn you.
NOTE:
Oil must be added not less than five minutes and not more than 60
minutes after engine shutdown to prevent over-servicing.
Do not apply more force than necessary to the handle to open the filler
cap.
Procedure:
- open the engine oil servicing access door on right fan cowl,
- check oil level on the sight gage on the oil tank,
- clean the oil tank scupper to prevent contamination during servicing,
- lift the filler cap handle to vertical (unlocked position),
- turn the filler cap handle counterclockwise against its stop to
disengage the locking device and remove the filler cap,
- add approved oil as necessary up to the MAX mark on the sight gage,
- examine the O-ring seal on the filler cap for good condition and
installation,
- install the filler cap with the handle in the vertical position,
- turn the handle clockwise against its stop to engage the locking
device and push it down to the locked position,
- make sure the filler cap is correctly installed,
- close the engine oil servicing access door.

MAINTENANCE (LEAP) <strong>OIL DEBRIS MONITOR (ODM)</strong>
The Oil Debris Monitoring Sensor (ODMS) is used to collect ferrous
particles from the scavenge oil before returning to the tank.
It is installed in the de-aerator at the top of the oil tank assembly.
When ferrous particles are captured, the ODMS sends an output pulse
(proportional to the particles mass) to the ODM Unit (ODMU).
The ODMU amplifies the signal, compares it with a pre-determined
threshold and sends it to the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) B.
If the threshold is exceeded, the EECs will generate the ECAM message:
ENG X OIL CHIP DETECTED.
This leads to inspect the ODMS for contamination on the magnetic tip.
If no findings, clean and reinstall the ODMS and perform an oil debris
reset and a FADEC test via the MCDU.
If you find oil debris, do a check of the A, B, C, Accessory Gearbox
(AGB) and Transfer Gearbox (TGB) sumps scavenge screen plugs for further
troubleshooting.

MAINTENANCE (LEAP) <strong>IDG SERVICING</strong>
The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) is monitored by several devices: an
internal oil level sensor, a mechanical filter Differential Pressure
Indicator (DPI), a sight glass, two internal oil temperature sensors (in
and out heat exchanger circuit connections).
The accurate oil level depends on the detected temperature displayed on
the ELEC System page.
Let the oil become stable for a minimum of five minutes after engine
shutdown.
For IDG oil level check, an access panel is located on the lower part of
the left fan cowl.
If the level is below the middle of the green band, add oil.
In case of over servicing (cold oil above the yellow band or hot oil in
the yellow band), it is necessary to drain the excess.
For IDG oil servicing, the left fan cowl has to be open to access the
pressure filling and overflow ports.
If the IDG oil filter DPI is extended (red button visible), do the
relative troubleshooting procedure.
