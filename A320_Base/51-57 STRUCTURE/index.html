PYLONS/NACELLES D/O (3) PYLONS SECONDARY STRUCTURE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT
The secondary structure is composed of: - the forward fairing, - the
pylon to wing center fillets, - the aft fairing, - the lower fairing.
The forward fairing can be divided into two sections; the cantilever
structure between Rib 01 and Rib 05, and the structure between Rib 05
and Rib 9. The cantilever structure has an aerodynamic contour between
the engine nose cowl and the pylon box structure. It routes all systems
and the bleed air from the engine to the fuselage. The structure between
Rib 05 and Rib 9 has an aerodynamic contour between the cantilever
structure and the wing leading edge, and enables the routing of various
system lines and electrical wiring. It includes in particular two
pressure relief doors (made from titanium), which are designed to open
in case of hot bleed air duct bursting. The structure is mainly made of
stainless steel alloy. The pylon to wing center fillets give an
aerodynamic contour between the pylon box and the wing bottom skin
panel. The pylon-to-wing center fillets are made of aluminum alloy ribs.
These ribs support the panels made of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic
(CFRP) and Aramid Fiber Reinforced Plastic (AFRP) sandwich construction.
The aft fairing is a removable secondary structure composed of two
parts: - a fixed fairing installed at the rear of the pylon box, - a
movable fairing underneath the flap. The fixed fairing is attached by
two points to the pylon box at Rib 10 and by one point to the wing box
at the false rear spar.

The fixed fairing is an assembling of ribs and skin panels made of
aluminum alloy, and includes a lower aft fairing made in inconel. The
movable fairing is hinged at Rib 14 and linked to the flap by a rod
attached to the fairing by a serrated plate system. The internal
structure of the movable fairing is mainly made of aluminum alloy. The
side panels are made from AFRP sandwich construction and the tail cone
is made from AFRP or CFRP monolithic construction. A fairing installed
under the pylon box (lower fairing) makes sure that there is a
continuity of the aerodynamic profile between the pylon box and the
engine nozzle. Its function is: - to supply thermal protection to the
pylon from the engine exhaust gases, - to smooth out protrusions with
minimal aerodynamic drag changes. The lower fairing structure is mainly
made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel and inconel alloys.

SRM D/O (3) NUMBERING SYSTEM AND PAGE BLOCK ALLOCATION Each subject,
within the SRM, is identified using a three-element numbering system
chapter/section and sub-section. - the first element designates the
chapter which is assigned by the ATA iSpec 2200 (formerly called ATA
100), - the second element designates the section within the chapter. -
the third element identifies the sub-section (subject) within the
section and is assigned by Airbus S.A.S. A standard page block
allocation is used for all SRM chapters. - Page Block (PB) 001 for
structure identification, - Page Block (PB) 101 for allowable damage, -
Page Block (PB) 201 for repairs. PB 101 and PB 201 can also be used for
Structural Repair Inspections (SRI), respectively for: - Allowable
Damage Inspections, - Repair Inspections.

SRM D/O (3) CHAPTER 52 TO 57 CONTENTS LAYOUT Chapters 52 to 57 are
specifically attributed as per ATA 2200 specification. Chapters 52 to 57
all have the same layout, which conforms to the defined page block
allocation system (PB 001 - identification, PB 101 - allowable damage,
PB 201- repairs). In addition, a table of contents and a Service
Bulletin (SB) list are provided at the beginning of each chapter.
Depending on the chapters, the Modification/Service Bulletin list is to
be found either at the chapter level, or main section level.
MODIFICATION:SERVICE BULLETIN LIST Located at: - section level for
chapter 52, - section level for chapter 53, - chapter level for chapter
54, - section level for chapter 55, - section level for chapter 57, this
list is given to the user to determine the effectivity of the
modification/SB. This list gives, for a given modification number, its
related suffix, and the effectivity expressed in MSN.

SRM D/O (3) CHAPTER 52 TO 57 CONTENTS (continued) IDENTIFICATION PAGES
In the identification pages, the individual parts of the major
components are illustrated and listed in tabular form. Each
identification topic begins with an introduction page, which includes a
general information paragraph. The item number is the key between the
illustration and the identification table. For composite structures, the
illustration gives the identification of individual layers, orientation
and materials. A ply (layer) orientation reference is also given. For
metallic structure such as fuselage skin panels, the different material
thicknesses are provided using letter codes or shaded areas as a key to
the thickness tables. The associated identification table provides
additional information about material, part number, modification status
information.

SRM D/O (3) CHAPTER 52 TO 57 CONTENTS (continued) IDENTIFICATION TABLE
DETAILED To find the relevant effectivity linked to a modification shown
in the STATUS column, the user must refer to the modification/service
bulletin list. NOTE: Note: the status before or after modification/SB
and the relevant modification solution (suffix letter) should not be
forgotten. Within the modification/service bulletin list, the
effectivities are expressed in MSN. In the given example item 1, P/N
D53230463200 is the basic seat track as it is not related to any
modification status. Item 1A P/N D53231741200 is related to modification
status A26101P4573. The letter A before the modification number means
"After mod." (letter B means "Before mod.) Sometimes a suffix in letter
is written after the modification number. For this example, we will
assume we are working on aircraft MSN 2065. According to the
modification / SB list, mod 261001P4573 (with"D" suffix letter) has been
embodied on our aircraft MSN 2065.

SRM D/O (3) CHAPTER 52 TO 57 CONTENTS (continued) ALLOWABLE DAMAGE PAGE
BLOCK The information to be found within allowable damage page block
enables the operator to define whether a damaged airplane may be
returned into service without repair. An allowable damage permitted has
no significant effect on the strength or fatigue life of the structure,
which must still be capable of fulfilling its function. Allowable damage
may require minimal rework such as cleanup or drilling of stop holes. -
general information pages, - damage criteria tables, - paragraph for
each type of damage, - damage measurement procedure, - damage
localization (zoning) figures, - allowable damage diagram. Most of
allowable damage paragraphs are associated to an effectivity per weight
variant and aircraft type table.

SRM D/O (3) CHAPTER 52 TO 57 CONTENTS (continued) REPAIRS PAGE BLOCK At
the beginning of each repair page block, a list of available repair
schemes is given for a quick assessment of repairs. The repairs can be
found in the general section of chapter 53 (e.g.: 53-00-11 for standard
fuselage skin repairs), or directly covered within the related section
when the repair is specific (e.g. paragraph 5A, Fig. 201). When repairs
are in repair category B, subsequent inspections are necessary and in
accordance with inspection instruction reference (SRI). The Repairs Page
Block (PB 201) contains necessary information to carry out permissible
repairs. Each of the repairs is described with illustrations and
procedure instructions, which includes repair applicability data and
repair material list. Most of repair paragraphs are related to an
effectivity per weight variant and aircraft type table.
