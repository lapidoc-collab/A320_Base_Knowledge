RECORDING SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The Flight Data
Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) has two primary functions. The
first is the Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) function. To obey the
mandatory requirements of crash recording, the FDIU acquires and formats
several important flight parameters and system data before it supplies
them to the Solid State Flight Data Recorder (SSFDR). The linear
accelerometer measures the acceleration of the A/C in all three axes.
The System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC) digitizes the analog
signal of the linear accelerometer and sends it to the FDIU. For
maintenance and performance purposes, the optional Quick Access Recorder
(QAR) records the same parameters as the SSFDR. The operation of the
SSFDR is automatic. On the overhead panel, there is a GrouND ConTroL
P/B, which is on the ReCorDeR panel. This P/B lets the SSFDR be supplied
when the A/C is on ground for preflight checks before engine start or
for tests and maintenance. On the center pedestal, there is a Digital
Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) EVENT P/B, which can be used to set an event
mark on the SSFDR memory.

RECORDING SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) COMPONENT LOCATION The DFDRS and
AIDS computers are in the aft avionics rack. About the QAR/DAR, there
are several vendors of optical disk storage media. The recorder is then
called Optical QAR/DAR (OQAR/ODAR). There is also a version from
Teledyne that includes a GSM module for data transmission called WQAR
(Wireless GroundLink QAR). The FDIMU computer is in the aft avionics
rack. The SSFDR is installed immediately above the Cockpit Voice
Recorder (CVR), in an unpressurized area of the rear fuselage. The SSFDR
stores the data of the last 25 hours collected by the FDIU. The SSFDR
stores these data in a solid state memory which is in a
crash-and-fire-protected housing. The linear accelerometer is near the
A/C center of gravity. It sends the accelerations in the 3 axes (pitch,
roll and yaw) to the DFDRS.

UP &amp; DOWN DATA LOADING SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL The data loading
system is an interface between the aircraft computers and ground data
processing equipment used to update software (S/W) and database or to
retrieve aircraft system data. The data loading system includes: - a
Data Loading Selector (DLS) to select the computer on which data will be
loaded, - a Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU) to upload or download
data, - a stowage box with a 42 disk maximum capacity (the Disk Stowage
is in the left and right sides consoles and can be locked with a key), -
a Data Loading Routing Box (DLRB) to route the input/output data between
the disk unit and the target computer. When Portable Data Loader (PDL)
connectors are installed, ARINC 615A data loading of the Air Traffic
Service Unit (ATSU) and Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) is
possible.

UP &amp; DOWN DATA LOADING SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) UP LOADING The aircraft
system computers use the loading system to update their data base, for
example the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) or to modify
parts of their operational S/W, for example the ATSU. The Up loading is
automatically done from a 3.5 inch disk, via an internal logic specific
to each computer. Power supply plug is installed to enable data loader
power supply.
DOWN LOADING The down loading system is used to down load, to a 3.5 inch
disk, the data recorded by some computers during aircraft operation, for
example the Data Management Unit (DMU) part of the Flight Data Interface
and Management Unit (FDIMU). Down loading is done automatically through
an internal logic specific to each computer.

DFDRS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) FDIMU The Flight Data Interface and
Management Unit (FDIMU) combines two functions which operate
independently from each other: the Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) and
the Data Management Unit (DMU). An internal data-bus connects the two
parts. The FDIU-part receives discrete and digital parameters and
processes them. The functions of the FDIU-part are: - conversion, -
comparison, - check and Built-In Test Equipment (BITE). The FDIU-part
converts the input parameters into a numerical format for: - the Digital
Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), - the optional Quick Access Recorder (QAR).
-the Digital AIDS Recorder (DAR) The FDIU-part compares the data that it
sends with the data recorded by the DFDR. The recorded data is
transmitted back to the FDIU-part through the playback data bus. For
PCMCIA recording function, data transmission from the FDIMU part to DMU
part is given through an internal ARINC 429 data bus. The FDIU-part
checks the integrity of the mandatory parameters during the flight.
After the flight, engines shutdown, only the Linear Accelerometer (LA)
signal check is done. The FDIU-part includes BITE and monitoring
functions.
DFDR
(SDACs). The DFDR energization is controlled through the power interlock
circuit. The underwater locator beacon installed on the front face of
the DFDR gives the location of the recorder if the aircraft is immersed
in water following an accident. The underwater locator beacon has a
battery, which is activated by both fresh and salt water.
QAR (OPTIONAL) The QAR stores the same data as the DFDR for on ground
performance, maintenance or condition monitoring tasks. The data frames
stored in the QAR are identical to the DFDR data frames. The QAR
includes BITE functions. The QAR status signals (QAR MEDIA LOW, QAR
FAIL) are sent to the lamps on its front face and to the CFDIU through
the FDIU-part. The QAR energization is controlled through the power
interlock circuit. If installed, the DAR records data in a formatted
optical disk.
LINEAR ACCELEROMETER The task of the LA is to measure the acceleration
of the aircraft in all three axes. The range of measurement is: -
vertical axis (Z): -3 to +6 g, - longitudinal axis (X): -1 to +1 g, -
lateral axis (Y): -1 to +1 g. The LA generates an analog signal, which
is sent to the SDACs. This signal is digitalized and sent to the
FDIU-part through an ARINC 429 bus.
The DFDR stores data, which the FDIU-part has collected during the last
25 hours. The data is recorded in data frames. Each frame contains data
received during one second. The DFDR includes BITE functions. The DFDR
status signal is sent to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit
(CFDIU) through the FDIU-part and to the Electronic Centralized Aircraft
Monitoring (ECAM) through the System Data Acquisition Concentrators

FDIMU INTERFACES (3) ARINC 429 INPUTS Most information is given to the
Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) through ARINC 429
buses. The Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) part of the FDIMU receives
15 ARINC 429 buses 10 of which are shared with Data Management Unit
(DMU) part. NOTE: The Linear Accelerometer (LA) sends an analog signal
to the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs), which digitalizes
it before to send it to the FDIU-part.
ARINC 429 OUTPUTS 2 ARINC 429 output buses are supplied. The output bus
to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) is used for
maintenance and test of the Digital Flight Data Recording System
(DFDRS). The output bus to the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU)
allows to load the application-software of the FDIU-part and DMU-part.
NOTE: To display the DFDR FAULT message on the ECAM, a DFDR status
signal is directly sent by the DFDR to the SDACs.
ARINC 717 OUTPUT The FDIU-part of the FDIMU sends the data to be
recorded to the DFDR and the optional QAR through ARINC 717 output bus.
ARINC 717 INPUT To verify the recorded data, the FDIU-part of the FDIMU
receives the DFDR playback data through ARINC717 input bus.
PCMCIA INTERFACE A PCMCIA interface is integrated in the FDIMU to upload
application-software and download Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS)
reports with a notebook computer.
RS 232
DISCRETE INPUTS
To enable the connection of a portable MCDU or a Portable Data Loader
(PDL), a test connector is installed on the front panel of the FDIMU.
The interface for maintenance test and program is RS 232.
54 discrete inputs are given for aircraft identification coding. 5 other
inputs are given for: - Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) status, -
event mark, Quick Access Recorder (QAR) FAIL, - QAR MEDIA LOW
information and, - MDDU selection. NOTE: The QAR is optional.
DISCRETE OUTPUT 1 discrete output is used by the SDACs to display the
FDIU FAULT message on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring
(ECAM).

PRINT REPORT STD HEADER DESCRIPTION (3) GENERAL
AIRCRAFT AND FLIGHT INFORMATION
A standard header is printed on each report. It is composed of
information about the report at the top, information about the aircraft
and the flight in the middle and general data at the bottom. The header
data is taken at the time when the respective report is generated.
Line CC contains the following data: - A/C ID: Aircraft identification
(tail number), - DATE (month/day), - UTC: Universal Time Coordinated
(hours/minutes/seconds), - FROM TO: City pair identification, - FLT:
Flight number. The flight number is defined by up to 8 characters but
only the last 4 numbers are used. Only numbers are possible and the not
used positions are filled with zeros. E.g. Flight Management and
Guidance Computer (FMGC) flight number AI067 is printed out 0067.
REPORT VALUE PRESENTATION Each data line starts with two identification
letters. The presentation of the values in the data lines is according
to: - their sign: Negative values begin with "N" and, for positive
values, "N" is replaced by "0" or another digit. - their operational
range without decimal point as listed in the parameter list associated
to the header and each report (for these lists, refer to Aircraft
Maintenance Manual (AMM) 31-37-00). E.g.: The operational range of the
Total Air Temperature (TAT) is from -60.0 to 99.9 °C. Therefore, -32.0
°C is printed out N320 and +26.5 °C is printed out 0265. In addition, a
parameter, which is invalid or not updated, is replaced with "_" or "X"
characters. NOTE: In this document, as well as in the AMM, generic

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) - depending on the DMU, which is
fitted on your aircraft, the LOAD REPORT \&lt;15&gt; may not be applicable.
GENERAL A report is a comprehensive set of data related to a specific
event (e.g. limit exceedance of engine parameters). The parameters
contained in the reports are among the parameters provided with an alpha
call-up (refer to Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 31-37-00 for the
detailed parameter list associated to each report). The Data Management
Unit (DMU) processes up to 23 different types of report: - 13 standard
reports for basic aircraft, engine and APU monitoring. These reports
have fixed trigger mechanism, fixed data collection and fixed output
formatting. Nevertheless, certain constants and limits within fixed
trigger logics are reprogrammable. Specific trigger conditions can be
created for each report by means of the Ground Support Equipment
(GSE). - up to 10 additional reports, numbered from 31 to 40, for
airline specific investigation and trouble shooting. These reports are
user programmable with the GSE for trigger conditions, data collection,
report format and output destination. In addition to the automatic
trigger logics, all the reports can be manually generated: - via MCDU, -
via Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS) PRINT P/B (according to
flight phase associations, if programmed), - via Air Traffic Service
Unit (ATSU) (uplink request). Refer to AMM 31-37-00 for the detailed
trigger logics associated to each report. A non-volatile memory for
storage of at least 10 reports per different type of report is provided
within the DMU. NOTE: S: - in this module, reports \&lt;01&gt; to \&lt;11&gt; are
given for a CFM engine. They may be slightly different to your aircraft
configuration.

ENGINE CRUISE REPORT \&lt;01&gt; This report is a collection of data over a
period of time in which the aircraft met the appropriate stability
criteria. The required stability period is 100 seconds (programmable
value). Basically, whatever the number of times the stability is
detected, only one report is generated per flight leg. This report
contains the data with the best engine quality number (QE) over the
whole flight leg. If no stability is detected, then a report is
generated with the following message in its last line: "NO STABLE FRAME
CONDITION". NOTE: In case of ENGINE DIVERGENCE REPORT \&lt;09&gt; generated,
an engine cruise report is also generated when the first stability is
detected, regardless of quality. The report mainly contains operating
data of both engines, including vibration data. The report data are
averages over the required stability period, except: - ESN, EHRS, ERT,
ECYC: Engine general data (serial number, flight hours, running time,
cycle), - AP: Autopilot status, - QE: Engine quality number used as
stability indicator for this report (00: best stability, 99: worst
stability), - OIQH: Oil consumption from the previous flight, - EVM,
ECW1, SSEL: Engine vibration status word, engine control word, and
status of Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) sensors, - data
lines V3, V4: Averaged values taken from the last stable descent
(i.e. descent of the last leg), - data lines V5, V6: Averaged values
taken from the last stable climb (i.e. climb of the current leg). NOTE:
For engine health monitoring purposes, 3 additional sensors can be
optionally connected to the FADEC to permit recording of the following
parameters: PS13 (fan tip discharge pressure),

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) CRUISE PERFORMANCE REPORT \&lt;02&gt;
This report is similar to ENGINE CRUISE REPORT \&lt;01&gt; except that more
information is provided about the aircraft. The following data is
added: - QA: Aircraft quality number used as stability indicator for
this report (00: best stability, 99: worst stability). - WFQ: Inner cell
fuel quantity, - ELEV: Elevator position, - AOA, SLP: Corrected
Angle-Of-Attack and side slip angle, - CFPG, CIVV: Last DMU calculated
flight path acceleration and inertial vertical speed, - ROLL, YAW: Roll
angle and body axis yaw rate (average), - THDG, LONP, LATP: True
heading, longitude and latitude positions, - WS, WD: Wind speed and
direction (average), - FT, FD: Fuel temperature and density (average), -
Flight controls positions (average). E.g. RSP5: Roll spoiler 5 position.
NOTE: Data lines X1, X4, X6 are issued from system 1 (e.g. FLAP
system 1) or left (e.g. left spoiler 5) while data lines X2, X5, X7 are
issued from system 2 or right. In addition, the trigger logic for this
report differs a little bit from the logic for ENGINE CRUISE REPORT
\&lt;01&gt; and is performed independently (e.g. the required stability
period can be different).

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) ENGINE TAKE OFF REPORT \&lt;04&gt;
GENERAL This report is generated while in the take off flight phase when
the sum of the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) for both engines is
maximum. It is used to check the trend and the stress of the engines
during take off. Basically, one report is generated per leg
(programmable frequency). The report mainly contains data of both
engines, including the maximum EGT (EGTM). The radio height (RALT),
provided by radio altimeters 1 and 2, is also printed.
"T/O DELTA N1 SUMMARY" DATA History of the difference between the
maximum value of N1 (N1MX) and the actual N1 during previous takeoffs is
provided for both engines. T/O DELTA N1 SUMMARY data is calculated a few
seconds after entry into the take off flight phase, independently from
the report trigger.

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) ENGINE GAS PATH ADVISORY REPORT
\&lt;06&gt; GENERAL The engine gas path advisory report is generated by any
of the following trigger conditions: - stall condition detected on one
engine, - exceedance of one of the primary engine parameters (EGT, N1,
N2) detected on one engine, - fuel Shut Off-Valve (SOV) closed in flight
for at least 4 seconds on one engine. The reason for exceedance is
displayed (STALL, EGT, N1, N2, SHUT DOWN). Basically, 3 sets of
parameters for both engines are recorded at 6 seconds intervals before
the event, 1 set at the event and 5 sets at 5 seconds intervals after
the event. The length of the pre-event and post-event intervals (Y1 and
Y2) is programmable. The number of datasets to be generated after the
event is also programmable (up to 20). Report generation stops when this
number is reached or when the exceedance parameters are again within
their limit.
LIMIT EXCEEDANCE SUMMARY The following data provides a summary on the
exceedance that occurred: - E: Engine (1 or 2) on which the exceedance
occurred, - MAX: Maximum value (peak) of the exceeded parameter, - LIM:
Programmable limit that was exceeded, - REF: N2 at stall detection (for
all other exceedance, zeros are printed), - TOL: Time over limit during
report generation, - TTP: Time to peak during report generation.

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) ENGINE DIVERGENCE REPORT \&lt;09&gt;
This report is generated while in the climb or cruise flight phases
when, under stabilized conditions, any of the following engine
divergence conditions is detected: - Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)
divergence exceeding a programmed threshold, - nacelle temperature (TN)
divergence exceeding a programmed threshold. The reason for divergence
is displayed (EGT, TN). This report is intended to detect quick
degradation in engine performance. 3 sets of parameters for both engines
are recorded at 2 seconds intervals before the event, 1 set at the event
and 3 sets at 2 seconds intervals after the event. In addition, the
following data is provided: - E: Divergent engine (1 or 2), - DIV:
Absolute divergence value of EGT (or TN), - REF: Reference delta value
of EGT (or TN). Since two engines do not behave with the same
performance characteristics, it is necessary to establish a reference
delta for the divergence. DIV = DIFF - REF, DIFF being the actual delta
value of EGT (or TN) between both engines.

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) ENGINE START REPORT \&lt;10&gt; This
report is generated in case of aborted engine start or EGT exceedance.
The possible aborted start reasons are: - starter air valve or HP
Shut-Off Valve (SOV) demand/position disagree, - EGT overtemperature, -
stall, - no engine light off, - hung start, - illegal start sequence, -
slow start. When effective, the reason is displayed (SAV, HPSOV, EGT,
STALL, NO LIGHT OFF, HUNG, START FAIL, SLOW). "EGT" is also displayed in
case of exceedance. Basically, 3 sets of parameters for one engine are
recorded at 5 seconds intervals before the event, 1 set at the event and
3 sets at 2 seconds intervals after the event. The length of the
pre-event and post-event intervals (Y1 and Y2) is programmable. NOTE:
The engine start report is also generated (with 7 post-event
datasets): - every 25 engine cycles (programmable frequency), - every
flight leg for 5 consecutive flight legs from initialization
(programmable number, up to 9).

temperature, - overtemperature, - sensor failure, - no acceleration, -
start time exceeded, - overspeed, - Electronic Control Box (ECB)
failure, - low oil pressure, - loss of speed, - Inlet Guide Vane (IGV)
failure. When effective, the reason is displayed. Basically, 20 sets of

INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM
REPORT \&lt;19&gt; The environmental control system report is generated when
there is a malfunction in the air conditioning or pressurization system.
The reason for report generation is displayed (e.g. EXCESSIVE CABIN
ALTITUDE). The report contains engine, aircraft and environmental data.
Basically, up to 19 sets of parameters can be recorded at 15 seconds
intervals before the event and 1 set at the event. The number of
pre-event sets as well as the length of the pre-event interval (Y1) are
programmable. In order to reduce the length of the report, a specific
procedure is applied for report output: - the first pre-event dataset is
generated completely as well as the at event dataset, - within the
intermediate datasets, a line is only generated if the value of an
included leading parameter has changed. E.g.: Cabin altitude (ZCB) is
observed for changes in each Vx line and causes the print out of one
line when the change limit is exceeded (i.e. +/- 100 feet).

AIDS PROGRAMMING (3) GSE The GSE is based on a compatible personal
computer and is divided into different software (S/W) modules. A major
module is the programming of the DMU functions. It mainly enables: - the
adjustment of the standard reports (e.g. report limits), - the addition
of customer reports (numbered from 31 to 40), - the addition of trigger
conditions, - the configuration of the Smart Access Recorder (SAR) and
Digital AIDS Recorder (DAR) recording channels (DAR is optionally
installed). In particular, the GSE user has the possibility to program
trigger conditions for: - standard reports (additional conditions), -
programmable reports, - SAR, - DAR. This programming is made by means of
logics defined in a specific language. In the example given here, report
31 is associated to logic 300 and will be triggered when the Exhaust Gas
Temperature (EGT) of engine 1 is greater than 850 °C for more than 3
seconds while in cruise flight phase. Once the programming is completed,
another GSE module generates the associated database
(i.e. setup/customer database). The database is stored on a floppy disk
or a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA)
disk then transferred to the DMU through a Portable Data Loader (PDL) or
the optional PCMCIA interface.

Number of the operational S/W, - the 3 following items of information
concern the setup/customer database: VVVV is the version number, LLLL is
the revision level, DDMMYY is the generation date. A password, defined
with the GSE, is required to access the following programming menus.
REPORT INHIBIT Inhibition for all the reports of the printing and/or
linking to the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU). The inhibition is
effective until the next DMU power off.
REPORT LIMITS Change, in a temporary way, of some report limits that are
programmable by the GSE. The change is effective for a predefined number
of days or legs (refer to the VALIDITY field).
REPORT COUNTERS Setting of the report internal counters at their
corresponding limit value.
STATISTIC COUNTERS Initialization and visualization of the engine/APU
hours and cycles. The DMU resets the engine/APU hours and cycles in case
of engine/APU change (engine/APU serial number change detection). The
menu then allows the correct values to be programmed for an engine or
APU after it has been changed.

AIDS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL INTERFACES The Data Management
Unit (DMU) part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU)
sends data to MCDU 1 and 2 (the 3rd is optional), to the printer and to
the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) through a single
ARINC 429 data bus. Each one of these responds through a separate data
bus. NOTE: Only one MCDU can be used at a time for the Aircraft
Integrated Data System (AIDS). The Aircraft Communication Addressing and
Reporting System (ACARS) and the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU)(if
installed) have individual input/output buses.
DAR INTERFACE BITE and DAR TAPE LOW information is delivered from the
Digital AIDS Recorder (DAR) to the FDIMU (DMU-part) through discrete
signals. BITE and DAR TAPE LOW information causes a class 2 message on
the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) maintenance status
("DAR") and two class 2 messages in the Centralized Fault Display System
(CFDS) (DAR FAULT and DAR TAPE LOW).
FDIU INTERFACE The Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) part of the FDIMU
sends Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) parameters to the DMU-part of
the FDIMU through an ARINC 429 bus so that they can be recorded on the
DAR.

AIDS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) SYSTEM INTERFACE The FDIMU (DMU-part)
receives approximately 13.000 parameters from various A/C systems
through ARINC 429 data lines. These parameters can be recorded by the
DAR. NOTE: In addition, spares inputs are provided. Among these ARINC
429 inputs data lines, some of them are selectable for high or low speed
from system computers.
PARAMETER CALL-UP Parameters transmitted on the connected data buses can
be shown on the MCDU in binary code with the label call-up function. At
FDIMU delivery, 200 parameters are already defined with alpha call-up
code and can be shown on the MCDU in engineering units. Approximately
1.500 parameters can be added to the initial alpha call-up list by
programming.
