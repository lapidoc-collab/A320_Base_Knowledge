POWERPLANT SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The CFM56-5B
engine is a dual-rotor, variable stator, high-bypass-ratio turbo-fan
power plant. The CFM56-5B can power all aircraft types of the Single
Aisle family. CFM56-5B engines are available in several thrust ratings.
All the engines have the same basic configuration. A programming plug on
the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) changes the available thrust. The
power plant installation includes the engine, the engine inlet, the
exhaust, the fan cowls and the reverser assemblies. The pylon connects
the engine to the wing structure. The engine is attached to the pylon by
forward and aft mounts.

POWERPLANT SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued)
THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM The reverse thrust is controlled by the ECU. A
manual selection of the reverse is done when the flight crew lifts the
latching levers on the throttle control levers. The reverse thrust
command is sent to the ECU and the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The
signal from the ECU to the directional valve is supplied to an
inhibition relay controlled by the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) in
relation to the position of the throttle control lever. In relation to
commands from the ECU, a Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) supplies hydraulic
power to operate the thrust reverser. The thrust reverser uses 4
hydraulically operated pivoting blocker doors to redirect the engine fan
airflow.

POWER PLANT INSTALLATION D/O (3) AIR INTAKE FUNCTIONS The main function
of the inlet cowl is to guide the airflow into the engine inlet and to
permit an aerodynamic airflow over the outer surface of the engine. If
engine anti icing on the cockpit overhead panel is selected to ON, then
hot bleed air from the engine is ducted to the cowl nose lip to prevent
ice build-up. The air then exhausts overboard through a flush exit duct
in the outer barrel. Longitudinal and transverse loads are distributed
into the fan case forward flange through a bolted joint. These loads are
due to: - the air intake structure own inertia as well as, - any
internal or external loads not taken in hoop tension through the inner
barrel skins. It incorporates a lightning protection system.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) ENGINE CHARACTERISTICS The Airbus A320 family is
powered by two CFM International CFM56-5 turbofan engines. These engines
can produce a thrust from 21600 lb (9800 kg) to 33000 lb (14970 kg)
depending on the aircraft version set by the engine data programming
plug. The CFM56-5B/3 Tech Insertion propulsion system is a modified
version of the CFM56-5B/P current production propulsion system, by
incorporation of some TECH56 technologies developed by CFM.
PYLON The engines are attached to the lower surface of the wings by
pylons. The pylons provide an interface between the engine and the
aircraft for electrics, fluids, pneumatics and mechanical forces.
NACELLE The engine is enclosed in a nacelle, which provides aerodynamic
airflow around the engine and ensures protection for the accessories.
ENGINE CONTROL The engine includes a Full Authority Digital Engine
Control (FADEC) system consisting of the Engine Control Unit (ECU) with
two independent channels, sensors, actuators and other peripheral
components on the engine. The FADEC system provides engine control,
engine monitoring and help for maintenance and trouble shooting.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) ENGINE BEARINGS The engine rotors are supported by
bearings installed in the two sump cavities. The forward sump is in the
fan frame and is the location of bearings No.1, No.2 (fan/booster shaft)
and No. 3 (High Pressure (HP) shaft). The aft sump is in the turbine
rear frame where are bearings No.4 for the HP shaft aft and No.5 for the
LP shaft. Bearings provide reduced rolling friction, support the rotors
axially and radially within the engine structure, and position the
rotors relative to the stators. The bearing must control the forces of
gravity weight, aerodynamic loads of pumping and turbine driving and
gyroscopic loads due to aircraft maneuvers.
NO.1 AND NO.2 BEARING The No.1 ball bearing is a thrust bearing which
carries the axial loads generated by the LP rotor system. The No.2
roller bearing takes the radial loads from the fan and booster rotor.
NO.3 BEARING The inlet gearbox assembly contains a core engine thrust
bearing, and a core engine roller bearing.
NO.4 AND NO.5 BEARING The No.4 bearing, which takes the High Pressure
Turbine (HPT) rotor radial loads, is a roller bearing installed between
the HPT rear shaft and the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) shaft. The No.5
bearing supports the LPT rotor aft end inside the turbine frame and
takes the radial loads.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) ENGINE SEALS (continued) SEAL PRESSURIZATION
PRINCIPLE The sumps are sealed with labyrinth type oil seals, which must
be pressurized in order to make sure that the oil is retained within the
oil circuit and, therefore, minimize oil consumption. Pressurization air
is extracted from the primary airflow (booster discharge) and injected
between the two labyrinth seals. The air, looking for the path with the
least resistance, flows across the oil seal, thus preventing oil from
escaping. Any oil that might cross the oil seal is collected in a cavity
between the seals and routed to drain pipes. Once inside the oil sump
cavity, the pressurization air becomes vented air and is directed to an
air/oil rotating separator and then, out of the engine through the
center vent tube, the rear extension duct and the flame arrestor.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) COMPRESSOR The CFM56-5B has two axial compressor
sections, one for each shaft: the Low Pressure Compressor (LPC) fan
booster section, and the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) section. The LPC
is composed of: fan frame, fan booster rotor, and fan booster stator.
The HPC section is divided into: HPC rotor, and HPC stator.
FAN FRAME ASSEMBLY The fan frame module carries inlet cowl loads to
support the fan, booster and HPC and their bearings, contains the
forward mount and supports transfer and accessory gearboxes. It provides
ducting for primary and secondary airflows and variable bleed valves.

ENGINE SYSTEM D/O (3) COMPRESSOR OPERATION The compressor forces the
airflow through the engine increasing its pressure. The mechanical
energy that the turbine provides to the compressor shaft is transmitted
to the airflow with the compressor blades. In the stator the airflow is
compressed progressively. Before entering the combustion chamber the
last stator vanes, called Outlet Guide Vanes, must redirect the airflow.
Due to the compression ratio the airflow tries to expand counter
direction. If the compressor is incapable to compress the airflow, the
compressor is surging. Stall is a local effect where the airflow is not
compressed. Stall effects can bring the compressor to surge. To prevent
the compressor surge the stall effects are controlled through the
methods of airflow control. The Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) and the
variable bleed valves are used to optimize stall margin.

compressor pass through the OGVs that redirect them, then in the
diffuser decrease their velocity and enter in the combustion chamber.
The gases are mixed with the fuel from the spray nozzles. When the
mixture encounters the burning zones, the combustion process starts. The
combustion process finishes before entering the HPT nozzles. The flow is
divided into the flow that goes through the combustion chamber and the
flow that encircles it. The flow that enters the combustion chamber goes
first through the dome in Single Annular Combustor engine and cools its
surface. The flow that encircles the combustion chamber is mixed with
the combusted gases entering the HPT nozzles to reduce the gas
temperature at the turbine inlet and provide a film cooling to the first
turbine nozzle.

ENGINE FUEL SYSTEM D/O (3) METERED FUEL The fuel from the fuel pump goes
through a Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) and a High Pressure Fuel Shut-Off
Valve included in the HMU. The fuel flows through the fuel flow
transmitter, then through a fuel nozzle filter, then to the nozzles.
OVERSPEED PROTECTION The overspeed governor system limits the core
engine speed (N2) to a maximum of 106%, in the event of a malfunction
that could drive the engine into an overspeed condition. The overspeed
governor is hydro-mechanical (flyweights) and independent of the ECU.
The Delta P valve is hydraulically forced to cause the by-passed valve
to stroke more open. More fuel is by-passed, decreasing fuel flow to the
FMV and, therefore, less fuel is available for combustion. TEST by ECU
At each engine start, the micro-switch informs the ECU that the governor
system is in operation. This micro-switch strokes open/close around 45%
of N2.

FADEC PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL
POWER SUPPLY
The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system controls the
engine. FADEC also interfaces with aircraft signals. The FADEC system of
each engine consists of a dual channel Electronic Control Unit (ECU),
with its associated peripherals. The ECU is the computer of the FADEC
system and is located on the engine fan case right hand side.
Each ECU is powered by a three-phase permanent magnet alternator when
the engine N2 &gt; 58%. The FADEC Control Alternator provides an
independent power supply to both ECU channels.
FADEC FUNCTIONS The FADEC provides the regulation and scheduling of the
engine systems to control the thrust and optimize engine operation. The
FADEC system performs engine control functions and engine/A/C
integration. The Engine control functions include: - Power management
control, - Variable Bleed Valves (VBVs) control, - Variable Stator Vanes
(VSVs) control, - Transient Bleed Valve (TBV) control, - Fuel control
regulation, - High Pressure Turbine Active Clearance Control (HPTACC), -
Low Pressure Turbine Active Clearance Control (LPTACC), - Fuel Return
Valve (FRV) control. Engine/A/C integration includes: - Engine
indication, - Engine maintenance data, - Automatic and manual
starting, - Thrust reverser control, - Autothrust, - Condition
monitoring data.

FADEC ARCHITECTURE (2) DUAL CHANNEL
BITE CAPABILITY
The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system is fully
redundant and built around two independent Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
channels - channel A and B. Each channel can control the different
components of the engine. Dual inputs, dual outputs, and automatic
switch over from one channel to the other, eliminates any dormant
failure. Channels A and B are permanently operational. But only the
channel in control, called the Active Channel, delivers output commands.
The other channel is called the Stand-by channel. The selection of the
Active and the Stand-by Channel is done at ECU power-up and during
operation.
The ECU is equipped with a Built-in Test Equipment (BITE) system which
provides maintenance information and test capabilities via the MCDU.
DUAL INPUTS All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual. Only some
secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating are single. To
increase the fault tolerant design, the parameters are exchanged between
the two control channels (inside the ECU) via the cross channel data
link. Each channel can also operate independently, without cross channel
data link.
HARDWIRED INPUTS
FAULT STRATEGY The ECU can detect and isolate failures using the BITE
system. The BITE system allows each ECU channel to determine permanently
its health status. The healthier channel is selected as the Active
Channel. The other one is the Stand-by Channel. When both channels have
the same health status, Active and Stand-by Channel selection alternates
after every engine start.
FAIL SAFE CONTROL If one channel is faulty, and the channel that is in
control cannot ensure an engine component function, the component is
moved to a fail-safe position. Example: if one channel is faulty and the
other channel is unable to control the Variable Bleed Valve (VBV)
position, the VBVs are set to the fail-safe open position.
Most of the communication between the A/C systems and the ECU is
transmitted over digital data buses. In addition, some signals are
hardwired directly from the A/C to the ECU.
DUAL OUTPUTS All of the ECU control outputs are dual. The channel that
is in control supplies the control signals to the various components
such as torque motors and solenoids. The other channel calculation is
used for crosschecking.

FADEC ARCHITECTURE (2) MAIN INTERFACES The ECU performs its tasks by
interfacing with A/C system computers, either directly, or via the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The EIU is an interface concentrator that
serves as the communication link, between the A/C systems and the FADEC
system. There is one EIU for each engine. The ECU receives inputs
from: - Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs), - Flight Control
Unit (FCU), - Environmental Control System (ECS) computers, -
Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), - Landing Gear Control
and Interface Units (LGCIUs), - cockpit engine controls including fire,
anti-ice systems and Throttle Lever Angle (TLA). The ECU sends outputs
to: - Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU), - Flight
Warning Computers (FWCs), - Display Management Computers (DMCs), -
Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs), - Centralized Fault
Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), - Bleed air Monitoring Computers (BMCs)

FADEC PRINCIPLE (2) GENERAL The Full Authority Digital Engine Control
(FADEC) system manages the engine thrust and optimizes the performance.
FADEC The FADEC includes the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and its
peripheral components and sensors used for control and monitoring. The
ECU interfaces with the other A/C systems through the Engine Interface
Unit (EIU). The primary parameters (N1, N2, Exhaust Gas Temperature
(EGT) and Fuel Flow (FF)) are sent by the ECU to the ECAM through DMCs.
Secondary parameters: - the oil quantity and oil pressure are sent to
the DMCs by the SDACs. If there is a failure of the SDACs, the EIU sends
data to the DMCs by the FWCs, - the oil temperature is sent by the EIU
to the DMCs through the FWCs, - the vibration parameters are sent by the
EVMU to the DMCs through the SDACs.
ENGINE INTERFACE UNIT Each EIU, located in the avionics bay, is an
interface concentrator between the airframe and the corresponding ECU
located on the engine. There is one EIU for each engine. It interfaces
with the corresponding ECU.
POWER MANAGEMENT The FADEC provides automatic engine thrust control and
thrust parameter limit computation. The FADEC manages power according to
two thrust modes: - manual mode depending on Throttle Lever Angle (TLA),
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
-   autothrust mode depending on autothrust function generated by the
    Auto Flight System (AFS). The FADEC also provides two idle mode
    selections: Minimum idle and approach idle. If the aircraft is on
    ground and extend the slats the engine will stay at minimum idle but
    in flight it will go to approach idle. The idle can also be
    modulated up to approach idle depending on: Air conditioning demand,
    wing anti-ice demand, engine anti-ice demand and oil temperature
    (for Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) cooling).
ENGINE LIMIT PROTECTION The FADEC provides overspeed protection for N1
and N2, in order to prevent the engine from exceeding certified limits
and also monitors the EGT.
ENGINE SYSTEM CONTROL The FADEC provides optimal engine operation by
controlling: - FF, - Turbine Clearance and Compressor Airflow.
STARTING AND IGNITION CONTROL The FADEC controls the engine start
sequence. It monitors N1, N2, and EGT parameters and can abort or
recycle an engine start. The FADEC controls the starting and ignition in
automatic mode when initiated from the ENG start panel (115 VU) or
manual mode when initiated from the ENG MAN START panel.
THRUST REVERSER The FADEC entirely supervises the thrust reverser
operation. In case of malfunction, the thrust reverser is stowed.

ECU INTERFACES (3) Computers (FWCs), Display Management Computers
(DMCs), Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs). Channel A also
provides outputs to the engine controls (torque motors and solenoids).
GENERAL The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) interfaces with various
systems through channels A and B.
ECU CHANNEL B OUTPUTS
ECU CHANNEL A INPUTS Channel A receives via bus network: - The
anemometric parameters for thrust calculation from the Air Data Inertial
Reference System (ADIRS), - The A/C command signals from the Engine
Interface Unit (EIU) for engine control. Each channel of the ECU
receives a hardwired FADEC Reset signal from the Master Switch and the
Autothrust instinctive disconnect signal from the push buttons on the
throttle levers. The Throttle Control Unit sends the Throttle Resolver
Angle (TRA). Each ECU also receives signals from engine sensors. NOTE:
The relationship between the Throttle Lever Angle (TLA) and TRA is
linear and: 1 degree TLA is 1.9 degrees TRA. The ECU is electrically
supplied via the EIU only when N2 is below 58%. The ignition is supplied
by 115 VAC.
Channel B provides outputs via ARINC buses to the: EIU, FWCs, DMCs, and
FMGC. It also provides outputs to the engine controls.
ECU CHANNEL B INPUTS Channel B receives ARINC data from the ADIRS as
channel A. Data from the EIU, however, are received by channel A only
and transmitted by the internal Cross Channel Data Link to channel B.
The hardwired discrete and analog input signals are the same as for
channel A: FADEC Reset, instinctive disconnect signal and TRA.
ECU CHANNEL A OUTPUTS Channel A provides outputs via ARINC buses to the:
EIU, Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) - DMU part,

ECU ELECTRICAL PWR SPLY CONTROL (3) GENERAL The Electronic Control Unit
(ECU) is supplied from the aircraft electrical power when the engine is
shut down or when N2\&lt;58%. The Permanent Magnet Alternator (PMA), which
is also called Control Alternator, supplies the ECU when the engine is
running and N2&gt;58%.
ECU automatic de-powering on the ground by the EIU: - five minutes after
aircraft power up, - five minutes after engine shut down (M/S to OFF) to
get continued engine maintenance data transmission. Note that releasing
the ENGine FIRE P/B out provides ECU power cut off from the aircraft
network.
FADEC GROUND POWER PANEL
POWERING N2\&lt;58% Each channel is independently supplied by the aircraft
28 VDC through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). At initial A/C power-up,
both engine ECUs are supplied with aircraft power for 5 minutes.
Aircraft 28 VDC is used for: - power-up check of the Full Authority
Digital Engine Control (FADEC) before engine start, - engine starting, -
powering the ECU while the engine is running below 58% N2. Note that the
EIU takes its power from the same bus bar as the ECU.
For maintenance purposes and MCDU engine tests, the ENGine FADEC GrouND
PoWeR P/B on the MAINTenance panel (50VU) permits FADEC power supply to
be restored on the ground with engine shut down. The EIU supplies power
to the FADEC as long as the GND PWR P/B is in the ON position. Also note
that the FADEC is repowered as soon as the engine start selector is
selected to CRANK or IGNition START or the MASTER switch is selected ON.
POWERING N2&gt;58% As soon as the engine is running above 58% of N2, the
Control Alternator supplies the ECU. The PMA supplies each channel with
three-phase AC power. Two transformer rectifiers provide 28 VDC power
supply to channels A and B. Above 58% of N2, the ECU logic automatically
switches to the control alternator supply. In case of control alternator
failure, the ECU will automatically switch over the 28VDC power supply
from the aircraft network, available as a back-up through the EIU.
AUTO DE-POWERING The FADEC is automatically de-powered on the ground,
through the EIU, after engine shutdown.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL
MANUAL START
The ignition system supplies the electrical spark needed to start or
continue engine combustion. It is comprised of two independent
subsystems. Each subsystem includes: - a spark igniter, - a fan air
cooled coaxial shielded ignition lead, - an ignition exciter. The
pneumatic starting system drives the engine High Pressure (HP) rotor up
to and above the engine self-sustaining speed for initial starting on
ground or supports an engine re-light in flight if required. The start
system is made of the pneumatic starter Shut-Off Valve (SOV) and the
pneumatic starter.
During a manual start, the pneumatic starter SOV opens when engine
MANual START P/B is pressed in, then the ignition system is energized
when the MASTER switch is set to the ON position. Note that also a
manual start can be automatically aborted in case of EGT overlimit or
compressor stall detection. Then the fuel is cut off and the engine will
dry crank.
CONTROL AND INDICATING
CRANKING Engine motoring could be performed for dry cranking or wet
cranking sequences. During cranking, ignition is inhibited.
CONTINUOUS IGNITION
The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) controls the ignition and starting
systems either in automatic or manual mode. The operation of the
pneumatic starter SOV and of the ignition system is displayed on the
ECAM ENGINE page.
With engine running, continuous ignition can be selected via the ECU
either manually using the rotary selector or automatically by the Full
Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC).
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
AUTOMATIC START During an automatic start, the ECU opens the pneumatic
starter SOV, then one of the two ignition exciter is energized when the
HP rotor reaches 16% of N2 speed. The ECU gives full protection during
the start sequence. When the HP rotor has reached 50% of N2, the ECU
closes the pneumatic starter SOV and cuts off ignition. In case of an
incident during the automatic start the ECU aborts the start procedure.
Safety precautions have to be taken prior to working in this area.
WARNING: the ECU sends 115 volts to the ignition exciters, which
converts it and sends high voltage, high-energy pulses through the
ignition leads to the spark igniters.
MAINTENANCE PRACTICES To increase aircraft dispatch reliability, the
pneumatic starter SOV is equipped with a manual override. For this
manual operation, the mechanic has to be aware of the engine safety
zones.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM D/O (ME) (3) GENERAL The Electronic Control
Unit (ECU) controls and monitors the start sequence either in automatic
or manual mode. In automatic mode the ECU is able, up to 50% N2, to
abort the start sequence in case of an incident such as: - starter
Shut-Off Valve (SOV) failure, - ignition failure, - High Pressure (HP)
fuel SOV failure, - hot start, - hung start or, - engine stall. The
system consists of a starter SOV, an air starter, two ignition exciters,
spark igniters (A and B) and two ignition leads. The starter SOV is
fitted with a manual override handle for manual operation in case of
electrical SOV failure. On the enhanced system, the same information is
provided with a different display presentation.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM D/O (ME) (3) AUTOMATIC START Start sequence
in automatic mode. The aircraft configuration in this case is the
following: - APU running and APU BLEED on, - Full Authority Digital
Engine Control (FADEC) 1 and 2 powered. When IGNition START is selected
the ENGINE page is called automatically. During engine start, the ENGINE
page includes IGN indication, starter SOV position and bleed pressure.
During this time the pack valves are automatically closed. If, after 30
seconds, the ENGine MASTER control switch is not switched to ON
position, the pack valves will re-open. As soon as the ENGine MASTER
control switch is set to ON position, the Low Pressure (LP) fuel SOV
opens and the ECU opens the starter SOV. The position of this valve is
confirmed on the ECAM and the N2 begins to increase. When N2 reaches 16%
the ECU provides ignition. The selection of the spark igniter is a
function of the ECU and at each start the igniter selection will be
changed. At 16% of N2, on the ENGINE page, the corresponding spark
igniter system (A or B) chosen by the ECU is displayed. When N2 reaches
22% the ECU controls, through the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV), HP fuel SOV
opening. At this percentage of N2, fuel flow begins. The ECU monitors
the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and N2 according to their schedules to
provide the correct fuel flow. The maximum EGT during start sequence is
725º C. In case of malfunction the ECU automatically shuts down the
engine and performs a dry motoring sequence. Up to 50% N2, the automatic
fuel flow regulation is performed. At 50% N2, the ECU closes the starter
SOV and cuts off the ignition. The pack valves re-open if another engine
is not started within 30 seconds. Engine 2 is now stabilized at minimum
idle.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
To start the second engine, you set the MASTER control switch 1 to ON
keeping the selector in the IGNition START position. To complete this
start sequence the selector is set back to MODE NORMal position. With
the selector in this position and at least one engine running, the WHEEL
page appears instead of the ENGINE page. If IGNition START is
re-selected, continuous ignition is initiated on the running engines. At
any time, if the MASTER lever is set to OFF, the start sequence or the
engine operation is stopped because the MASTER control switch directly
energizes the HP fuel SOV solenoid. With the MASTER control switch at
OFF, the LP and HP SOVs are closed. With both engines shut down, the
DOOR/OXYgen page is displayed.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM D/O (ME) (3) MANUAL START Start sequence in
manual mode. The aircraft configuration: - APU running and APU BLEED
on, - FADEC 1 and 2 powered. When IGNition START is selected the ENGINE
page is called automatically. During start the ENGINE page displays IGN
indication, starter SOV position and bleed pressure. During this time
the pack valves are automatically closed. If, after 30 seconds, the
ENGine MANual START P/B is not switched ON, the pack valves will
re-open. Selecting the ENGine MANual START P/B opens the starter SOV.
After that, the N2 begins to increase and, when it is at least 20% N2,
the MASTER control switch must be set to the ON position. Before the
MASTER control switch is set to ON, it is possible to interrupt the
sequence by selecting the MANual START P/B switch to OFF. As soon as the
MASTER control switch is set to the ON position, both ignition systems
are energized, LP and HP SOV are opened and fuel flow increases. At 20%
of N2 with the MASTER control switch at ON, dual ignition and fuel flow
are initiated. The ECU monitors the EGT and N2, according to their
schedules, to provide the correct fuel flow. The maximum EGT during
start sequence is 725º C. In case of malfunction, set the MASTER control
switch to OFF to perform a start abort sequence. In manual starts there
is no automatic shutdown function. Up to 50% of N2, the automatic fuel
flow regulation is performed. When N2 reaches 50%, the ECU automatically
closes the starter SOV and cuts off the ignition. The pack valves
re-open after 30 seconds. Engine 2 is now stabilized at minimum idle.

To start the other engine, set the ENGine 1 MANual START P/B to ON,
keeping the selector in the IGNition START position and then, when N2
reaches 20%, set the MASTER control switch 1 to ON. After engine start,
the selector is set back to MODE NORMal position. With the selector in
this position and one engine running, the WHEEL page appears instead of
the ENGINE page. If IGNition START is re-selected, continuous ignition
is initiated on the running engine(s). To complete the start sequence,
the MANual START P/B is released out. The action on the MANual START P/B
has no effect on the starter SOV which has already been automatically
closed at 50% of N2, it is only done to complete the manual start
procedure.

CRANK When the MASTER control switch is set to the ON position, the LP
and HP fuel SOV are opened. For a wet crank, the MASTER control switch
is normally set to ON between 15 and 20% of N2. CAUTION: - DO NOT MOTOR
THE ENGINE FOR MORE THAN 15 SECONDS WITH THE MASTER CONTROL SWITCH IN
THE ON POSITION. After a wet crank of 15 seconds maximum, when the
MASTER control switch is set to the OFF position, the fuel is cut off
and the starter SOV closes following the reset of the ECU. After the
reset of the ECU, the ECU will command the starter SOV to open when the
N2 speed is less than 10%. The dry CRANK procedure is initiated.
Continue to dry crank the engine for 60 seconds (within the starter
limitation of 2 minutes on), this will dry the fuel that can be in the
combustor. After 60 seconds, release the MANual START P/B switch to
interrupt the crank sequence and set the selector back to MODE NORMal
position. When the MANual START P/B is released out, the starter SOV
closes. With the selector in the MODE NORM position and engines shut
down, the DOOR/OXYgen page is displayed on the ECAM.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM D/O (US) (3) GENERAL The Electronic Control
Unit (ECU) controls and monitors the start sequence either in automatic
or manual mode. In automatic mode the ECU is able, up to 50% N2, to
abort the start sequence in case of an incident such as: - starter
Shut-Off Valve (SOV) failure, - ignition failure, - High Pressure (HP)
fuel SOV failure, - hot start, - hung start or, - engine stall. The
system consists of a starter SOV, an air starter, two ignition exciters,
spark igniters (A and B) and two ignition leads. The starter SOV is
fitted with a manual override handle for manual operation in case of
electrical SOV failure. On the enhanced system, the same information is
provided with a different display presentation.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM D/O (US) (3) AUTOMATIC START Start sequence
in automatic mode. The aircraft configuration in this case is the
following: - APU running and APU BLEED on, - Full Authority Digital
Engine Control (FADEC) 1 and 2 powered. When IGNition START is selected
the ENGINE page is called automatically. During engine start, the ENGINE
page includes IGN indication, starter SOV position and bleed pressure.
During this time the pack valves are automatically closed. If, after 30
seconds, the ENGine MASTER control switch is not switched to ON
position, the pack valves will re-open. As soon as the ENGine MASTER
control switch is set to ON position, the Low Pressure (LP) fuel SOV
opens and the ECU opens the starter SOV. The position of this valve is
confirmed on the ECAM and the N2 begins to increase. When N2 reaches 16%
the ECU provides ignition. The selection of the spark igniter is a
function of the ECU and at each start the igniter selection will be
changed. At 16% of N2, on the ENGINE page, the corresponding spark
igniter system (A or B) chosen by the ECU is displayed. When N2 reaches
22% the ECU controls, through the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV), HP fuel SOV
opening. At this percentage of N2, fuel flow begins. The ECU monitors
the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and N2 according to their schedules to
provide the correct fuel flow. The maximum EGT during start sequence is
725º C. In case of malfunction the ECU automatically shuts down the
engine and performs a dry motoring sequence. Up to 50% N2, the automatic
fuel flow regulation is performed. At 50% N2, the ECU closes the starter
SOV and cuts off the ignition. The pack valves re-open if another engine
is not started within 30 seconds. Engine 2 is now stabilized at minimum
idle.

To start the second engine, you set the MASTER control switch 1 to ON
keeping the selector in the IGNition START position. To complete this
start sequence the selector is set back to MODE NORMal position. With
the selector in this position and at least one engine running, the WHEEL
page appears instead of the ENGINE page. If IGNition START is
re-selected, continuous ignition is initiated on the running engines. At
any time, if the MASTER lever is set to OFF, the start sequence or the
engine operation is stopped because the MASTER control switch directly
energizes the HP fuel SOV solenoid. With the MASTER control switch at
OFF, the LP and HP SOVs are closed. With both engines shut down, the
DOOR/OXYgen page is displayed.

IGNITION &amp; STARTING SYSTEM D/O (US) (3) MANUAL START Start sequence in
manual mode. The aircraft configuration: - APU running and APU BLEED
on, - FADEC 1 and 2 powered. When IGNition START is selected the ENGINE
page is called automatically. During start the ENGINE page displays IGN
indication, starter SOV position and bleed pressure. During this time
the pack valves are automatically closed. If, after 30 seconds, the
ENGine MANual START P/B is not switched ON, the pack valves will
re-open. Selecting the ENGine MANual START P/B opens the starter SOV.
After that, the N2 begins to increase and, when it is at least 20% N2,
the MASTER control switch must be set to the ON position. Before the
MASTER control switch is set to ON, it is possible to interrupt the
sequence by selecting the MANual START P/B switch to OFF. As soon as the
MASTER control switch is set to the ON position, both ignition systems
are energized, LP and HP SOV are opened and fuel flow increases. At 20%
of N2 with the MASTER control switch at ON, dual ignition and fuel flow
are initiated. The ECU monitors the EGT and N2, according to their
schedules, to provide the correct fuel flow. The maximum EGT during
start sequence is 725º C. In case of malfunction, set the MASTER control
switch to OFF to perform a start abort sequence. In manual starts there
is no automatic shutdown function. Up to 50% of N2, the automatic fuel
flow regulation is performed. When N2 reaches 50%, the ECU automatically
closes the starter SOV and cuts off the ignition. The pack valves
re-open after 30 seconds. Engine 2 is now stabilized at minimum idle.

To start the other engine, set the ENGine 1 MANual START P/B to ON,
keeping the selector in the IGNition START position and then, when N2
reaches 20%, set the MASTER control switch 1 to ON. After engine start,
the selector is set back to MODE NORMal position. With the selector in
this position and one engine running, the WHEEL page appears instead of
the ENGINE page. If IGNition START is re-selected, continuous ignition
is initiated on the running engine(s). To complete the start sequence,
the MANual START P/B is released out. The action on the MANual START P/B
has no effect on the starter SOV which has already been automatically
closed at 50% of N2, it is only done to complete the manual start
procedure.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL To
prevent compressor surge and to give a good acceleration, the engine has
a Variable Bleed Valve (VBV) system and a Variable Stator Vane (VSV)
system. Both systems are fuel operated by the HydroMechanical Unit (HMU)
and controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).
VARIABLE BLEED VALVE SYSTEM The VBV system controls the airflow from the
fan and the booster to the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) by using 12
valves. By dumping excessive air into the fan air stream, the VBVs
increase the booster mass flow and improve the booster and the HPC
matching at low speed and transient operations.
VARIABLE STATOR VANE SYSTEM The VSV system controls the primary airflow
through the HPC by varying the angle of the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) and
three stages of variable vanes. The VSVs give aerodynamic matching of
the LP stages of compression with the HP stages to prevent engine surge.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) VBV SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The function
of the Variable Bleed Valve (VBV) system is to regulate the amount of
air discharged from the booster into the inlet of the HPC. To eliminate
the risk of booster stall during low power conditions, the VBV system
by-passes air from the primary airflow into the secondary airflow. It is
installed within the fan frame mid-box structure and is composed of: -A
fuel gear motor -A stop mechanism -A master bleed valve -Eleven variable
bleed valves -Flexible shafts -A feedback sensor (RVDT) The ECU
calculates the VBV position and the HMU gives the necessary fuel
pressure to drive a fuel gear motor, through a dedicated servo valve.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) VBV OPERATION FUEL GEAR MOTOR The
fuel gear motor transforms high pressure fuel flow into rotary driving
power to position the master bleed valve, through a screw in the stop
mechanism. The fuel flow sent to the gear motor is constantly controlled
by the ECU, via the torque motor and servo valve in the HMU.
STOP MECHANISM The stop mechanism limits the number of revolutions of
the gear motor to the exact number, required for a complete cycle (open
and close) of the VBV system. The stop mechanism is located in between
the gear motor and the master ball screw actuator.
MASTER BLEED VALVE and FEEDBACK SENSOR The master bleed valve and
ballscrew actuator assembly is a unit, which transmits the driving input
from the gear motor to the 11 remaining variable bleed valves (VBV's). A
lever, integral with a hinged door, is connected to a feedback rod,
which transmits the angular position of the door to an RVDT. This sensor
gives the position feedback to the ECU. It has two marks, which should
be aligned when the system is adjusted to the fully closed position. The
adjustment is done through the feedback rod in between the master bleed
valve and the RVDT.
VARIABLE BLEED VALVES (VBV's) The master bleed valve drives the 11
variable bleeds valves (VBVs) through a series of flexible shafts. The
flexible shafts make sure that the VBVs remain fully synchronized
throughout their complete operation.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) VSV SYSTEM OPERATION The VSV system
positions the compressor VSVs to the angles necessary to give the
optimum compressor efficiency and stall margin for transient engine
operation. Stator vane angle is a function of core engine speed (N2) and
altitude. The VSV actuator drives the VSV linkage assembly to the stator
angle calculated by the ECU, through the HMU. The torque motor supplies
fuel to the actuator to close or open the vanes or hold their position
by pressure balancing the actuator piston. The LVDT transmits a feedback
signal of actual vane position to the ECU for comparison to scheduled
position.

CONTROL (LPTCC) The Low Pressure Turbine Clearance Control (LPTCC)
system uses fan discharge air to cool the LPT case during engine
operation, in order to control the LPT rotor to stator clearances. It
also protects the turbine case from over-temperature by monitoring the
EGT. This ensures the best performance of the LPT at all engine ratings.
The LPTCC system is a closed loop system, which regulates the cooling
airflow sent to the LPT case, through a valve and a manifold. A dual
RVDT sensor is installed at one end of the butterfly valve shaft and
supplies the feedback signal to the ECU.

AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) TRANSIENT BLEED VALVE (TBV) The
Transient Bleed Valve (TBV) system improves the HPC stall margin during
engine starting and rapid transient acceleration. Using engine input
parameters, the ECU logic calculates when to open or close the TBV to
duct HPC 9th stage bleed air, in order to give optimum stability for
transient mode operations. The 9th stage bleed air is ducted to the LPT
stage 1 nozzle, providing an efficient start stall margin. The ECU,
working through the HMU, controls the TBV position. The TBV system
consists of: - The TBV, located on the HPC case, between the 7 and 8
o'clock positions. - The 9th stage air IN and OUT pipes. The valve
position is monitored by the ECU, through a dual channel LVDT. The LVDT
supplies the feedback signal, which agrees with the butterfly position.

THROTTLE CONTROL SYSTEM D/O (3) THROTTLE CONTROL LEVER The Throttle
control handle comprises: o a throttle control lever which incorporates
stop devices, autothrust instinctive disconnect pushbutton switch o a
graduated fixed sector o a reverse latching lever. The throttle control
lever is linked to a mechanical rod. This rod drives the input lever of
the throttle control artificial feel unit. The throttle control lever
moves over a range from -20 deg. TLA (Reverser Full Throttle stop) to
+45 deg. TLA: o -20 degrees TLA corresponds to Reverser Full Throttle
stop o +45 degrees TLA corresponds to Forward Full Throttle stop An
intermediate mechanical stop is set to 0 deg.TLA. This stop is
overridden when the reverse latching lever is pulled up for selection of
the reverse power. This stop is reset as soon as the throttle control
lever is selected back to forward thrust area. In the forward thrust
area, there are two detent points, the MAX CLIMB detent point set to 25
deg.TLA and the MAX CONTINUOUS/FLEX TAKE-OFF detent point set to 35
deg.TLA. In the reverse thrust throttle range, there is one detent point
at - 6 deg.TLA. This position agrees with the selection of the thrust
reverser command and the Reverse Idle setting. In the middle throttle
range (0deg. To 35 deg.TLA), the autothrust function can be active if
engaged. This range agrees with the selection of MAX CLIMB or MAX
CONTINUOUS thrust limit mode (in single operation). If the autothrust is
not engaged, the engine control is manual. In the forward range (35 deg.
To 45 deg.TLA), the autothrust function cannot be activated (except in
alpha floor condition).This range agrees with the selection of FLEX
TAKE-OFF/MAX TAKE-OFF Mode.

sectors assembled face to face. Each sector drives itself a set of one
resolver and three potentiometers. The relationship between the throttle
lever angle and throttle resolver angle (TRA) IS LINEAR AND 1 DEG.TLA =
1.9 TRA. The accuracy of the throttle control unit (error between the
input lever position and the resolver angle) is 0.5 deg.TRA. The maximum
discrepancy between the signals generated by two resolvers is 0.25
deg.TRA. The TLA resolver operates in two quadrants. The first quadrant
is used for positive angles and the second quadrant for negative angles.
Each resolver is dedicated to one FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) and receives
its electrical excitation current (6 VAC) from the related FADEC channel
(ECU / EEC) The ECU considers a throttle resolver angle value: o less
than -47.5 deg.TRA or o greater than 98.8 deg.TRA as resolver position
signal failure. The ECU includes a resolver fault accommodation logic.
This logic allows engine operation after a failure or a complete loss of
the throttle resolver position signal.

PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION The No. 1 bearing sensor is formed by an
accelerometer located at 9:00 o'clock position on No. 1 and No .2
bearing support and a sensor cable that is routed through the fan frame.
The No. 1 bearing vibration sensor permanently monitors the vibrations
from No. 1 bearing and the vibrations from LPT and High Pressure Turbine
(HPT) shafts. It's also used to the fan trim balance procedure. The
Turbine Rear Frame (TRF) vibration sensor is installed at 12 o'clock on
the front flange of the TRF. The TRF vibration sensor is used as back-up
of N1 bearing accelerometer to monitor and, if necessary, reduce the
engine vibration level using the trim balance procedure. The aircraft
EVMU uses the vibration and the rotational speed signals to extract all
the vibration signals and compute the position and the amplitude of the
unbalanced signals. As normal vibration is depending on rotor speed, for
each speed, the EVMU processes the ratio actual value/maxi value. This
ratio is multiplied by 10 and is available on the EVMU output for
display on ECAM SD.

THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) For third defence line purposes,
the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) have previously opened the Shut
Off Valve and the hydraulic pressure is supplied to the HCU. Then, the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU) permits reverser deployment by energization
of the inhibition relay, so the directional valve can be opened by the
ECU. To command the thrust reverser, the ECU needs an "A/C on ground"
signal supplied by the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units
(LGCIUs).
REVERSER DESIGN The thrust reverser system is of the aerodynamic
blockage type. It consists of 4 pivoting blocker doors which stop and
redirect fan discharge airflow. Two doors are installed on each "C"
duct. Thrust reverser operation is possible on ground only.
HYDRAULIC SUPPLY The thrust reverser system is hydraulically supplied by
the corresponding hydraulic pump on the engine. The thrust reverser is
isolated from the hydraulic supply by a Shut Off Valve.
ACTUATION Each door is operated by a hydraulic actuator. The actuators
receive fluid from the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) which is controlled
by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Two independent latch mechanisms
maintain each pivoting blocker door in the stowed position, one inside
the actuator and the second with the door latch. The door latches are
hydraulically released in series at the beginning of the deploy
sequence.
REVERSER CONTROL Basically the thrust reverser system is controlled
through the ECU from the two reverser latching levers located on the
throttle control levers. The HCU has a pressurizing valve and a
directional valve to select deploy or stow mode. The directional valve
is operated to deploy only.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
REVERSER INDICATING The actual state of the thrust reverser is shown on
the ECAM warning display (REVerser indication in the middle of N1 dial).
The signals come from the stow and deploy position switches. Reverse
thrust is allowed when reversers are deployed.
MAINTENANCE PRACTICE To help trouble shooting, a reverser test can be
performed through the MCDU. For maintenance purposes or to increase A/C
dispatch, the HCU is fitted with a deactivation lever to deactivate the
thrust reverser system. For the lock-out procedure, four lock-out bolts
should also be installed. WARNING: The thrust reverser system should be
deactivated using the HCU lever, before working on the system or on the
engine. If not, the thrust reverser can accidentally operate and cause
serious injuries to personnel and/or damage to the reverser.

THRUST REVERSER MANAGEMENT (3) GENERAL The thrust reverser system is
controlled independently for each engine by the associated Full
Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system.
THRUST REVERSER ACTUATION The hydraulic power required for the actuators
is supplied by the normal A/C hydraulic system: - Green system for
engine 1, - Yellow system for engine 2. A Shut-Off Valve (SOV) located
upstream of the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) provides an independently
controlled locking system. Each channel of the Electronic Control Unit
(ECU) controls and monitors solenoid valves in the HCU. The HCU provides
hydraulic pressure for unlocking, deploying, stowing and locking of the
actuators and latches of the pivoting doors. The HCU includes a
pressurizing valve, a pressure switch and a directional valve which is
controlled through the inhibition relay.

THRUST REVERSER MANAGEMENT (3) THRUST REVERSER CONTROL
THRUST REVERSER INDICATION
When the reverse thrust is selected in the cockpit, the following
sequence occurs: - when the potentiometers detect a Throttle Lever Angle
(TLA) lower than -3º, the SOV opens if the altitude is less than 6 feet
and if high forward thrust is not selected on the opposite engine. Then
the HCU is supplied hydraulically. The SOV is controlled open by the
Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) through the static and power relays. -
when the switch of the throttle control unit detects a TLA \&lt; -3.8º, the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU) energizes the inhibition relay. The ECU
energizes the pressurizing valve solenoid in the HCU. A Pressure Switch
in the HCU gives a feedback signal to the ECU. The four actuators are
initially pressurized on the rod side of the pistons keeping the doors
in the stowed position. - When the A/C is on ground with engines running
(N2 condition) and the resolvers detect a TLA \&lt; -4.3º, the ECU controls
the thrust reverser operation through the HCU. The ECU energizes the
solenoid of the directional valve. The four hydraulic latches at the
pivoting door open sequentially. Only when all four latches are open the
hydraulic pressure pushes on the head side of the hydraulic actuators.
The pivoting doors open. When reverse thrust operation is no longer
selected from the cockpit the ECU controls the pivoting doors to move to
the stow position by energizing the pressurizing valve solenoid while
the directional valve solenoid remains de-energized. The stow and deploy
switches are used to monitor the pivoting door position and for ECU
control.
The thrust reverser operating sequences are displayed in the cockpit on
the EWD. An amber REV indication comes on on the N1 indicator when the
doors are in transit. It becomes green when the doors are deployed.

NOTE: If there is a mechanical inhibition of the thrust reverser (for
dispatch), a caution "ENG X REV INHIBITED" is displayed on the ECAM to
tell the crew that the thrust reverser is inoperative.

OIL SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The engine oil system includes: - a supply
circuit, - a scavenge circuit, - a vent circuit. It lubricates and cools
the bearings of the forward and aft sumps. It also lubricates and cools
bearings and gears in the transfer and accessory gearboxes. The oil
system is a "dry sump" full flow system. A single pressure pump and four
scavenge pumps of gerotor type are located in a single lubrication unit.
The major components of the oil system are the oil tank, the lubrication
unit, the servo fuel heater and the main oil/fuel heat exchanger. The
detectors and sensors shown on the schematic give indicating and
monitoring.

OIL SYSTEM D/O (3) OIL SUPPLY The oil from the tank flows through the
supply pump and the main filter, or through the back up filter in case
of main filter clogging. The supply pump pressure is not controlled, but
the oil output flow is, by design, always greater than the lubrication
requirements. A pressure relief valve bypasses part of the output flow
to protect the supply pump against abnormal output pressure build-up. If
the main filter becomes clogged, a clog switch sends a signal to the
ECAM, a bypass valve opens and the oil flows through the backup filter.
The oil flows to the forward and aft sumps, and to the accessory and
transfer gearboxes. The anti-siphon device prevents oil from draining by
gravity from the tank through the pump into the gearbox after engine
shutdown. It uses air from the forward sump.

scavenge pumps. A strainer protects each pump. The scavenge oil then
flows through a master chip detector, then is cooled through the servo
fuel heater and the main oil/fuel heat exchanger before returning to the
oil tank. For ground inspection, the master chip detector, which is of
an electrical type, has a visual indicator (pop-out) operated in case of
metal particles contamination. For trouble-shooting, a maintenance kit
of 4 chip detectors may be installed on the lower part of the

lubrication unit gives the lubrication functions. The lubrication unit
supplies oil under the required pressure for lubrication of the engine
bearings and gears, for scavenge of the oil after lubrication and when
the oil goes back to the tank. But, before the oil goes back to the
tank, the scavenged oil from the engine sumps circulates, successively,
through: - The 4 scavenge screens (in the lubrication unit housing)
which give a first and coarse filtration of the oil scavenged from the
AGB, the engine forward bearing sump, the TGB and the engine aft bearing
sump, - The master magnetic chip detector (on the lubrication unit)
through which circulates the total scavenged oil flow. The lubrication
unit is installed on the right-hand side of the AGB front face. The
lubrication unit has a single housing containing the following items: -
Five positive displacement pumps (one oil supply and 4 scavenge
pumps), - One oil temperature sensor, - One clogging indicator
transmitter (oil filter differential pressure switch) which sends to the
cockpit a warning about main oil filter clogging, if this occurs during
engine operation, - One bypass valve for the main oil supply filter, -
One master magnetic chip detector (MCD) to detect the contamination of
the engine oil system by magnetic chips/particles and connected to a

OPENING &amp; CLOSING OF ENGINE COWL DOORS (2) CLOSING OF THE ENGINE THRUST
REVERSER COWL DOORS Inspect the J-Ring on the forward of the thrust
reverser and the V-Groove circumference on the engine to make sure there
is no excessive grease or dirt. Apply a thin coating of grease to the
J-Ring and the V-Groove. Remove the cap from the quick disconnect on the
junction box. CAUTION: Caution: Do not use a hydraulic hand pump with a
flow rate higher than the aircraft maintenance manual maximum limit and
make sure the hydraulic hand pump is filled with the correct oil type.
Connect the flexible hose of the Hand Pump to the thrust reverser door
quick disconnect on the hydraulic junction box. NOTE: Note: Two hand
pumps should be used, one for each side Operate the hand pump to
pressurize the opening actuator and to take the load off the hold open
rod. Disconnect the quick release pin from the bracket of the forward
frame Attach the hold-open rod to the upper or lower bracket on the
adapter ring assembly with the quick release pin.
Open the relief valve on the hand pump to let the thrust reverser door
close. Push the thrust reverser doors together to engage the door
latches. Make sure that the latch hooks on the right thrust reverser
door are correctly engaged in the stirrups (eyebolts) on the left thrust
reverser door. Push each latch handle closed until it snaps over-center
and the handle stays in the thrust reverser door slots. Depressurize the
hydraulic pump and let the fluid from the actuator drain back into the
hydraulic pump reservoir. Wait approximately one minute before removing
the hydraulic pump flexible hose from the quick disconnect on the
hydraulic junction point. Disconnect the hose of the hand pump from the
quick disconnect on the hydraulic junction box. Put the cap back on the
quick disconnect. Make the thrust reverser serviceable after maintenance
by removing of the lockout pin from the hydraulic control unit (HCU) OFF
position and moving the hydraulic control lever to the aft, HCU not
locked position. Make sure that the work area is clean and clear of
tools or other items before removal of the access platform.
CAUTION: Caution: Install the quick release pin with the head facing
outwards to prevent damage. Make sure the ring on the quick release pin
is down. The ring rubs on the tubes. If the ring is not down it can rub
on the tubes and cause damage. Make sure while closing the reverser cowl
that the cable that attaches the quick release pins (upper and lower) of
the hold open rod is not trapped between the v-groove and j-ring or
damage may occur to both parts.

THRUST REVERSER DEACTIVATION &amp; LOCKOUT (2) THRUST REVERSER DEACTIVATION
AND LOCKOUT This procedure is carried out when a fault occurs on the
thrust reverser system which can not be repaired for the next flight.
Deactivation and lockout devices are therefore provided to secure the
pivoting doors in their stowed position when an aircraft has to be
dispatched with an inoperative thrust reverser. Before working on the
engine safety precautions have to be taken in the cockpit. On Panel 115
VU put a warning notice to tell people not to start the engines. On the
Overhead Panel, panel 50 VU, make sure that the on legend from the FADEC
Ground Power switch is off and install a warning notice. Open the fan
cowl doors and put the access platform into position Make the Thrust
reverser unserviceable by removing the quick release pin from the
stowage position on the HCU, move the inhibition lever to the OFF
position and insert the quick release pin. Do an operational test of the
thrust reverser system with the CFDS in accordance to the AMM. Energize
the related ECU with the FADEC Ground Power Pushbutton Switch on panel
50VU. Get access to the CFDS System Report Test, select next page and
select the line key next to engine. Select the line key related to the
FADEC 1A or 1B menu to get access to the System Test and Reverser Test
menu. Obey the cautions and warnings in the AMM and on the MCDU before
you start the Reverser Test to prevent any injury to personnel or damage
to equipment. Make sure that the green or amber REV indication does not
appear in the N1 indication on the engine and warning display. Check
that the ECAM warning Engine 1 or Engine 2 reverser fault appears. Make
sure that none of the following messages appear on the test report after
the test : "DEPL SW, J5/J6, ECU" "STOW SW, J5/J6, ECU"
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
"DPLSTW SW, J5/J6, ECU" "EIU, HCU or TR LOCK, TR ACT" "HCU (TRPV), HYD
or HCU, TRSOV, HYD" Remove the screw that attaches the lockout fairing
to the pivoting blocker door. Remove the bolt that attaches the
lock-plate from the stowage bracket and remove the lock-plate. Remove
the lockout bolt from the stowage bracket. Install the lockout bolt on
the pivoting blocker door and torque it correctly in accordance to the
values mentioned in the AMM. Put the lock-plate over the lockout bolt
and install the smaller bolt. Torque it correctly in accordance to the
values in the AMM. Attach the lockout fairing to the stowage bracket and
torque the screw correctly in accordance to the values in the AMM.
Repeat this procedure with all pivoting blocker doors at the related
engine Make sure that the working area is clean and clear of tools.
Remove the access platform and close the fan cowl doors. Remove the
warning notices in the cockpit. Do a FADEC ground test (engine non
motoring). Make sure that the following fault messages are not shown :
"DEPL SW, J5/J6, ECU" "STOW SW, J5/J6, ECU" "DPLSTW SW, J5/J6, ECU" In
the cockpit install a warning notice to show that the thrust reverser is
inoperative. Make an entry into the logbook. This completes the Thrust
Reverser deactivation procedure for flight operation.

POWER PLANT SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MASTER CHIP DETECTOR CHECK There
is a red pop-out indicator visible from the oil-servicing door. If
extended, this indicates that the Electrical Master Chip Detector (EMCD)
is contaminated and the probe should be checked. To reset the red
pop-out indicator, if necessary (depending on SB status of engine),
remove the transparent cap and push in the clogging indicator with the
thumb. The EMCD probe is located on the lubrication unit and is made up
of two magnets separated by a gap. The probe will collect any magnetic
particles in the oil system. If the particle contamination closes the
gap between the magnets an electrical signal is generated to extend the
pop-out indicator. To check for contamination, remove the probe as
follows: - Open the left fan cowl, - At the same time, push and turn the
EMCD plug ¼ turn counterclockwise, - Disengage the EMCD from its
housing, - Check the AMM for examples of NORMAL and ABNORMAL
contamination, - Clean the EMCD, - Replace o-ring if necessary and

procedure has two parts. First, the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) is
deactivated. Moving the deactivation lever to the inhibit position
prevents the pressurizing valve from supplying hydraulic pressure to the
reverser actuators. In the second part of the deactivation procedure,
each pivoting door is secured (bolted) to the reverser structure
preventing any movement. To lockout the pivoting doors, special lockout
bolts and red lock plates are stored on a storage bracket located on the
lower forward face of the right thrust reverser cowl door. On each
pivoting door a lockout fairing is removed to install lockout bolts in
the lockout position. The lockout bolts are installed and secured by
lock plates to attach the pivoting doors to the structure of the thrust
reverser cowl doors. The lockout fairing plates and screws are stored on

POWER PLANT SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS The engine and
pylon drain system is designed to collect fuel, oil, water and hydraulic
fluid from engine systems and accessories and discharge them overboard
through the engine drain mast and the pylon drain tubes. For
troubleshooting and leak isolation a drain collector is installed on the
accessory gearbox. The drain collector supplies the drain manifold
module, which supports the drain mast. The drain mast also has separate
drains for additional leak isolation. The pylon drain tubes collect
fluids from individual pylon chambers, also for leak isolation. If fluid
leaks are found during transit operations, the AMM (ATA 70-00 &amp; ATA
29-00) lists maximum permitted leakage limits for the drain system.
There are limits for STATIC (engine not running) and DYNAMIC (engine
running) conditions. Here are some examples of leakage limits for
dispatch. See the AMM for complete list. NOTE: In the case of extreme
cold weather condition (Outside Air Temperature (OAT) \&lt;- 20 deg.C (- 4
deg.F), fuel leaks from the drain mast may occur on a non-running engine
and during engine start. This leakage is expected to stop after a 5
minute warm-up at minimum idle.

MANUAL OPERATION OF T/R PIVOTING DOOR (3) MANUAL DEPLOYMENT OF THE
PIVOTING BLOCKER DOOR Before working on the engine safety precautions
have to be taken in the cockpit. On panel 115VU put a warning notice to
tell people not to start the engines. On the overhead panel, panel 50VU
make sure that the ON legend from the FADEC ground power switch is off
and install a warning notice. Open the Fan Cowl Doors and deactivate the
Thrust Reverser System. To enable the manual unlocking of the hydraulic
latch a part of the thermal blankets has to be removed. Turn the Dzus
(pronounced Zooss) fastener on the thermal blanket to loosen it and
remove the blanket from the related blocker door latch. Turn the manual
unlock shaft on the blocker door latch to the unlock position, using a
5/16 in spanner. The manual unlock shaft can be accessed through a slot
on the blocker door latch. Pull on the door to make sure that it can not
be opened yet. The lock inside of the actuator prevents the opening of
the door. If the door opens replace the actuator. To unlock the
hydraulic actuator turn the manual unlock square on the actuator to the
unlock position, using a spanner. Now the hydraulic latch and actuator
are released and the pivoting blocker door opens. Open the blocker door
by manually pulling on the edge. CAUTION: To prevent damage, do not push
on the stow switch lever when the blocker door is open. For safety
reasons install a safety sleeve on the hydraulic actuator rod of the
deployed door. Once the door is open and secured maintenance tasks are
allowed. This completes the manual opening procedure.

ENGINE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION OVERVIEW (3) ENGINE PRESERVATION The
preservation procedures protect the CFM56 engine against corrosion,
liquid and debris entering the engine, and atmospheric conditions during
periods of storage, and inactivity. This includes installed engines on
inoperative aircraft or engines not to be operated for more than 30
days. The procedure recommended for preservation of the engine will vary
depending upon the duration of inactivity, the type of preservation
used, and if the engine is operable or non-operable. NOTE: engines that
can be started are considered operable. Engines that for any reason
cannot be started are considered non-operable. The preservation
procedure to be used is based upon the following schedule: up to 30
days, up to 90 days, between 30 to 365 days, preservation renewal
requirements, procedure for exceeded long term preservation and
de-preservation. See Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) for specific
storage requests. Before a preservation procedure some cautions must be
observed. CAUTION: if engine was ferried or subjected to an In-Flight
Shutdown, engine must be dried out and re-lubricated within 24 hours as
per dry out procedure of this section. CAUTION: under no circumstances
shall preservative oil or equivalent be sprayed into the engine inlet,
core compressor or turbine, or engine exhaust. Dirt particles on wet
blades and vanes may adversely affect engine performance during
subsequent operation.
