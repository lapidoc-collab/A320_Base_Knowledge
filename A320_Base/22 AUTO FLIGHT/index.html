AUTOMATIC FLIGHT SYSTEM DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (2) GENERAL
FLY BY WIRE
The Automatic Flight System (AFS) calculates orders to automatically
control the flight controls and the engines. It computes orders and
sends them to the Electrical Flight Control System (EFCS) and to the
Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) to control flying surfaces
and engines. When the AFS is not active, the above-mentioned components
are controlled by the same systems but orders are generated by specific
devices: side sticks and thrust levers.
If the pilot moves the side stick when the AFS is active, it disengages
the autopilot. Back to manual flight, when the sidestick is released,
the EFCS maintains the actual aircraft attitude.
NAVIGATION A fundamental function of the AFS is to calculate the
aircraft position. To compute the aircraft position, the system uses
several aircraft sensors, which give useful information for this
purpose.
SYSTEM DESIGN To meet the necessary reliability, the AFS is built around
4 computers. There are two interchangeable Flight Management and
Guidance Computers (FMGCs) and two interchangeable Flight Augmentation
Computers (FACs). It is a FAIL OPERATIVE system. Each FMGC and FAC has a
command part and a monitor part to be FAIL PASSIVE.
FLIGHT PLAN The AFS has several flight plans predetermined by the
airline in its memory. A flight plan describes a complete flight from
departure to arrival; it gives vertical information and all intermediate
waypoints. The plan can be displayed on the EFIS or on the Multipurpose
Control &amp; Display Units (MCDU).
OPERATION There are several ways to use the AFS but the normal and
recommended one is to use it to follow the flight plan automatically.
Knowing the position of the aircraft and the flight plan chosen by the
pilot, the system is able to compute the orders sent to the flying
surfaces and the engines so that the aircraft follows the flight plan.
The pilot has an important monitoring role. NOTE: During AFS operation,
side sticks and thrust levers do not move automatically.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL The Automatic Flight
System (AFS) gives pilots functions that reduce their workload and
improve safety and regularity of the flight. The AFS is designed
around: - 2 Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs), - 2 Flight
Augmentation Computers (FACs), - 2 Multipurpose Control and Display
Units (MCDUs), - 1 Flight Control Unit (FCU).
CONTROLS The FCU and the MCDUs let the pilots control the functions of
the FMGCs. The FAC engagement P/BSWs and the RUDder TRIM control panel
are connected to the FACs. The MCDUs are used for long-term control of
the aircraft and do the interface between the crew and the FMGC allowing
the management of the flight. The FCU is used for short-term control of
the aircraft and is the interface required for transmission of engine
data from the FMGC to the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC).
NOTE: The FAC includes an interface between the AFS and the Centralized
Fault Display System (CFDS) called Fault Isolation and Detection System
(FIDS).
OTHER SYSTEMS The AFS is connected to the majority of the aircraft
systems. Examples of AFS data exchanges: - reception of the aircraft
altitude and attitude from the Air Data/Inertial Reference System
(ADIRS), - transmission of autopilot orders to the ELevator and Aileron
Computers (ELACs).
FMGC There are two interchangeable FMGCs. Each FMGC is made of two
parts: the Flight Management (FM) part and the Flight Guidance (FG)
part. The FM part gives the functions related to flight plan definition,
revision and monitoring and the FG part gives the functions related to
the aircraft control.
FAC There are two interchangeable FACs. The basic functions of the FACs
are the rudder control and the flight envelope protection.

FAC GENERAL (2) FUNCTIONS The basic functions of the Flight Augmentation
Computer (FAC) are: - yaw damper, - rudder trim, - rudder travel
limitation, - flight envelope protection, - Fault Isolation and
Detection System (FIDS).
YAW DAMPER The yaw damper has four functions and controls the rudder via
yaw damper actuators. Upon Flight Management and Guidance Computer
(FMGC), ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) or FAC orders, the yaw damper
provides: - dutch roll damping, - turn coordination in cruise, - engine
failure compensation in auto flight, - yaw guidance order execution.
RUDDER TRIM The rudder trim orders come from the RUDder TRIM selector,
or from the FMGC to control the rudder via the rudder trim actuator. The
rudder trim gives: - the manual trim with RUD TRIM selector, - auto trim
on yaw axis and the generation of engine failure recovery function when
the autopilot is engaged.
RUDDER TRAVEL LIMITATION The rudder travel limiting unit limits the
deflection of the rudder according to the aircraft speed. The rudder
travel limiting function: - limits the deflection for structure
integrity,
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
-   prevents excessive deflections which would penalize the aircraft
    performance. Aircraft speed information is given by the Air
    Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs).
FLIGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION For flight envelope protection, the FAC
computes the various characteristic speeds for aircraft operation, the
low energy warning, the excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) and wind shear
detections. The characteristic speeds are computed using data from the
ADIRU, the Landing Gear Control Interface Unit (LGCIU), the FMGC, and
the Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC). Then, they are displayed on the
PFDs. The alpha floor (excessive AOA) and wind shear detections are sent
to the FMGCs. The low energy warning computation is sent to the Flight
Warning Computers (FWCs) which generate an aural warning: "SPEED, SPEED,
SPEED".
FIDS For maintenance purposes, the FIDS centralizes the failure
information from the various BITE of the AFS computers and provides an
interface between these BITEs and the Centralized Fault Display
Interface Unit (CFDIU). The FIDS function is only active in FAC 1.
CONTROLS Each FAC receives inputs from its related P/BSW, the RUD TRIM
selector and the RUD TRIM RESET P/B. The RUD TRIM selector deflects the
rudder. The RESET P/B returns the rudder to the neutral position.
DISPLAYS Some of the data computed by the FAC is displayed: - the
characteristic speeds are displayed on the speed scale of the PFDs.

- the rudder trim position is displayed on the F/CTL ECAM page and on
the RUD TRIM control panel. The red WINDSHEAR indication is displayed in
the center of both PFDs.

FMGC GENERAL (2) MANAGEMENT
CONTROLS GENERAL
GENERAL
The Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) functions, Flight
Management (FM) and Flight Guidance (FG), are mainly controlled from the
Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDUs) and the Flight Control
Unit (FCU). Typical actions are: - before departure, on the MCDUs, the
pilots select the flight plan which will be followed later on by the
aircraft. - in flight, on the FCU, the pilots can engage the AP and can
modify different flight parameters leading to an immediate change in the
control of the aircraft.
The FM part mainly gives the flight plan selection with its lateral and
vertical functions. The FM part gives the navigation, performance
optimization, radio navigation tuning and information display
management. Data computed by the FM part is occasionally used by the FG
part.
MCDU
LATERAL FUNCTIONS
Basically, the MCDUs give the long-term interface between the crew and
the FMGCs. The MCDUs show, for example: - the introduction or the
definition, the modification and the display of flight plans, - the
display, the selection and the modification of the parameters associated
with the FM functions, - the selection of specific functions.
The main lateral functions are: - aircraft position determination, -
Inertial Reference System (IRS) alignment through the MCDU, - automatic
or manual (through MCDU) selection of VOR, DME, ILS, ADF frequencies, -
guidance computation along the lateral flight plan. A navigation
database supplies all necessary information to build a flight plan;
however pilots can enter other data using the MCDU.
FCU
VERTICAL FUNCTIONS
Basically, the FCU gives the short-term interface between the crew and
the FMGCs. For example, the FCU can be used for: - the engagement of the
AP, Flight Director (FD) and A/THR functions, - the selection of
required guidance modes (e.g. heading hold), - the selection of various
flight parameters (e.g. heading value).
The main vertical functions are: - optimized speed computation; the
resulting target speed being used as reference for guidance functions, -
performance predictions as time, fuel, altitude, wind at various points
of the flight, - guidance computation along the vertical flight plan. A
performance database supplies necessary data; however pilots have to
enter other data using the MCDU.

FLIGHT PLAN A flight plan contains the various elements and constraints
of the route the aircraft must fly along from take-off to landing. A
flight plan can be selected, built-up, modified and monitored through
the MCDU.

DISPLAYS
GUIDANCE GENERAL
GENERAL
The FG part gives the AP, FD and A/THR functions. These functions work
according to modes generally chosen on the FCU. The normal way to
operate the aircraft is to use the management part as reference source
for the guidance part.
Various displays are used to present Flight Management and Guidance
System (FMGS) data and information. The main displays presenting flight
management and guidance information are: - the MCDUs (display part), -
the FCU (display Part), - the PFDs, - the NDs, - the ECAM/EWD and ECAM
STATUS pages.
AP The AP function calculates the signals for the flight controls in
order to follow the selected modes. The AP controls the pitch, roll and
yaw axis according to the selected modes. Example of AP mode: Altitude
hold.
MCDU The MCDUs display all data related to the management part. Example:
Identification of the successive waypoints of the flight plan.
FD The FD displays the guidance commands on both PFDs, allowing the
pilots to fly the aircraft manually according to the FMGC demands. Two
cases have to be considered: AP not engaged: - the FD function displays
symbols on the PFD which gives orders to the pilot to maintain the
desired parameter(s). In this case, the pilot follows these orders by
acting on the flight controls. AP engaged: - the FD function displays
symbols on the PFDs representing the AP orders to be monitored by the
pilot.
A/THR The A/THR function calculates the signal necessary for engine
control in order to follow a given mode. Example of A/THR mode:
Acquisition and holding of a speed or a Mach number.
FCU The FCU is also considered as a display as it includes indication
lights and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) windows. The FCU includes: -
lights giving mode indications, - LCD windows showing reference
parameters. Example: During a climb with AP, the altitude window
displays the altitude the aircraft is going to capture.
PFD The PFDs mainly display the FD symbols and the status of guidance
functions and their modes. They also display reference parameters.
Example: The target speed value is represented by a symbol on the speed
scale of the PFD.
ND The NDs mainly display the flight plan and various navigation data.
Example: Airports or waypoints around the present position of the
aircraft.

AUTOPILOT PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL
TAKE-OFF
The AP is engaged from the Flight Control Unit (FCU) by the related
pushbuttons. AP engagement is indicated by the illumination of the AP 1
P/BSW or/and the AP 2 P/BSW (Three green bars) and by the white "AP1",
"AP2" or "AP1+ 2" indication on the top right corner of each PFD. The AP
guidance modes are selected from the FCU or the Flight Management and
Guidance Computers (FMGCs). The AP function is a loop where, after a
comparison between real and reference parameters, the FMGC computes
orders, which are sent to the flight controls. The loop is closed by
real values coming from sensors and given by other systems (e.g. ADIRS)
to the FMGCs. When the AP is engaged, the load thresholds on the rudder
pedals and the side sticks are increased. If a pedal or side stick load
threshold is overridden, the AP disengages.
The AP can be engaged in flight, provided the aircraft has been airborne
for at least 5 seconds.
MODES
If the airfield is equipped with ILS installations, the AP can perform a
complete landing with approach, flare and roll out. A second AP can be
engaged (AP 1 active, AP 2 in standby).
There are lateral modes and vertical modes. Basically, one of each is
chosen by the pilot or by the system. The AP being engaged, one lateral
mode and one vertical mode are simultaneously active. According to
flight phases, the lateral mode controls: - the ailerons via the
ELevator Aileron Computers (ELACs), - the spoilers via the ELACs and the
Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs), - the rudder via the Flight
Augmentation Computers (FACs), - the nose wheel via the ELACs and the
Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU). The vertical mode controls the
elevators and the THS via the ELACs.
GROUND
CRUISE In cruise, only one AP can be engaged at a time, priority given
to the last engaged. Engaging the second AP disengages the first one.
The ailerons and the spoilers execute the orders of lateral modes; the
elevators and the THS execute the orders of vertical modes. NOTE: The
rudder is controlled not by the AP but directly by the FACs.
LANDING
NOTE: The rudder is controlled by the AP via the FACs. During roll out,
the AP gives steering orders to the rudder and the nose wheel. These
orders depend on the aircraft speed. Aileron and spoiler AP orders are
null. The THS is reset to 0.5 nose up. NOTE: The spoilers are directly
controlled by the SECs as airbrakes. During roll out, at low speed
(about 60 knots), the pilot normally disengages the AP by pressing a
takeover pushbutton located on the side stick.
For maintenance purposes, the AP can be engaged on ground with both
engines shut down. Hydraulic power is not required. When an engine is
started, the AP disengages.

FLIGHT DIRECTOR PRESENTATION (2) ENGAGEMENT The Flight Director (FD)
functions are engaged automatically as soon as the system is
electrically supplied and logic conditions are fulfilled. FD engagement
is indicated on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) by the FD P/BSW green bars
and on the top right of each PFD. 1FD2 indication is displayed on each
PFD to show that FD1 is engaged on the CAPT side and FD2 is engaged on
the F/O side.
and PFD 2 for the F/O FD P/BSW. If a lit FD P/BSW is pressed, the green
bars go off. Pressing the P/BSW again puts the green bars on again. A
non lit FD P/BSW means that no FD symbols can be displayed on the
corresponding PFD. -FD2 is displayed on each PFD to show that no FD
symbols can be displayed on PFD 1 and FD 2 is engaged on the F/O side.
NOTE: On ground, as long as no AP/FD mode is active, there are no FD
symbols on the PFDs.
PRINCIPLE The FD displays the Flight Management and Guidance Computer
(FMGC) guidance commands on both PFDs. In manual flight, the FD displays
guidance orders to help the pilots to apply commands on the controls in
order to follow the optimum flight path, which would be ordered by the
AP if it was engaged. When the AP is engaged, the FD helps the FMGC
demands to be checked. The FD modes are the same as the AP modes and are
selected the same way. The FMGCs calculate AP/FD orders which are
transformed into symbols by the Display Management Computers (DMCs).
There are two types of symbols: the FD bars, the Flight Path Director
(FPD) and Flight Path Vector (FPV) symbols. The central HeaDinG-Vertical
Speed (HDG-V/S)/TRacK-Flight Path Angle (TRK-FPA) P/BSW on the FCU makes
the pilots switch between these two types of symbols.
FD PUSHBUTTONS Upon FCU power up, in go around, or when losing the AP
during the roll out phase of the landing, the three green bars of the FD
P/BSWs come on automatically. A lit FD P/BSW means that the FD symbols
can be displayed on the corresponding PFD: PFD 1 for the CAPT FD P/BSW

FLIGHT DIRECTOR PRESENTATION (2) in terms of current track and FPA
actually being flown. The FPV symbol position is computed by the Air
Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRS).
FD BARS The FD bars can be displayed provided HDG-V/S is selected on the
FCU. HDG-V/S is automatically selected at system power up.
NOTE: The yaw bar is identical to the FD bar case and appears with the
same conditions.
NOTE: At certain system configuration changes, the FMGCs send a command
to the DMCs to make the FD bars flash for 10 seconds. AP/FD modes are
correctly followed when the FD bars are centered on the fixed aircraft
model of the PFDs. There are three FD bars: - the pitch bar, - the roll
bar, - and the yaw bar. The horizontal pitch bar can be displayed if a
vertical mode is active except during the roll out phase of the landing.
The vertical roll bar can be displayed if a lateral mode is active.
Below 30 feet RA at take-off when a LOCalizer (LOC) signal is available
and during landing, the roll bar is replaced by a yaw bar index. This
bar is then centered when it is just below the central yellow square.
FPD/FPV SYMBOLS The FPD and the FPV symbols can be displayed provided
TRK-FPA is selected on the FCU. NOTE: At certain system configuration
changes, the FMGCs send a command to the DMCs to make the FPD and FPV
symbols flash for 10 seconds. AP/FD modes are correctly followed when
the FPD and FPV symbols are superimposed. The FPD symbol supplies
command signals to intercept and fly the lateral and vertical flight
path as defined by the FMGCs. The FPD symbol is removed if no guidance
mode is provided by the FMGCs. The FPV symbol represents lateral and
vertical flight path information

AUTOTHRUST PRESENTATION (2) AUTOTHRUST FUNCTION The A/THR function sends
a computed thrust command (thrust target) to the Full Authority Digital
Engine Control (FADEC) for automatic engine control. The A/THR functions
are: - acquisition and holding of a speed or a Mach number, -
acquisition and holding of a thrust, - reduction of the thrust to idle
during descent and during flare in final approach, - protection against
excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) called alpha-floor protection, by
ordering a maximum thrust when an alpha-floor detection signal is
received from the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs).
AUTOTHRUST LOOP PRINCIPLE To get the A/THR function, the thrust target
computed by the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) is
chosen by the Flight Control Unit (FCU). Then each FCU processor sends,
along its own bus, the thrust target to the FADEC via the Engine
Interface Units (EIUs).
When A/THR is engaged: - the FCU A/THR P/BSW is lit, - the engagement
status is displayed on the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA). When engaged,
the A/THR can be active or not depending on the position of the thrust
levers. When engaged and not active, the thrust control is manual. The
thrust is commanded according to the position of the thrust levers. When
engaged and active, the thrust control is automatic. The thrust is
commanded according to the A/THR computed thrust target.
AUTOTHRUST DISCONNECTION A/THR disengagement can be manual or automatic.
A/THR is manually disconnected: - either by pressing the A/THR
instinctive disconnect switch on any thrust lever, - or by setting all
thrust levers to idle position, - or through the dedicated FCU P/BSW,
A/THR is automatically disconnected in case of failure detection.
AUTOTHRUST ENGAGEMENT The engagement of the A/THR function can be manual
or automatic. The A/THR is engaged manually by pressing the A/THR P/BSW
on the FCU. This is inhibited below 100 feet RA, with engines running.
The A/THR is engaged automatically: - when the AP/Flight Director (FD)
is engaged in Take-Off (TO) or Go Around (GA) modes, - or in flight,
when the alpha-floor is detected; this is inhibited below 100 feet RA
except during the 15 seconds following the lift-off. NOTE: To
effectively have A/THR on the engines, the engagement of the A/THR is
confirmed by a logic of activation in the FADEC.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT SYS MAINTENANCE SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL
BITE
The Auto Flight System (AFS) is a type 1 system, ables to maintain a
two-way communication with the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit
(CFDIU). The line maintenance of the AFS is based on the use of the
Fault Isolation and Detection System (FIDS) active in the Flight
Augmentation Computer (FAC) 1 and of the BITEs located in the various
AFS computers. Access to the fault data is made through the Multipurpose
Control and Display Units (MCDUs) via the CFDIU. Like for other systems,
the CFDIU works in NORMAL mode and MENU mode (See ATA 31-CFDS).
According to its internal architecture, each AFS Line Replaceable Unit
(LRU) has one or several BITEs. The basic purpose of a BITE is to
detect, isolate, memorize failures, the Flight Control Unit (FCU) and
MCDU BITEs only perform the detection task. The failure detection is
triggered by specific events listed in the maintenance manual. Example
of Flight Guidance (FG) CoMmanD (CMD) triggering event: ILS own failure.
The failure localization corresponds to an analysis processed to
identify the source of the failure.
FIDS The FIDS is a card physically located in each FAC. Both FACs are
interchangeable, but only the FAC 1 FIDS is active due to the side 1
signal. The FIDS is used as a system BITE to concentrate maintenance
information. The FIDS is linked in acquisition and reception to the
CFDIU and is connected to the BITEs of the various AFS computers. It
receives commands from the CFDIU, interprets these commands and
transfers them, if applicable, to the various BITEs concerned. It
receives malfunction reports from the BITEs, manages these reports, and,
if applicable, consolidates the BITE diagnosis (occurrence,
correlation...) and generates a fault message, which is sent to the
CFDIU. NOTE: If the FIDS fails, the BITEs continue to work and the
results can be read in the shop or after FAC 1 change. The NORMAL mode
function is the same as in other systems. In addition to the usual
system report functions, the MENU mode gives access to GROUND SCAN, AFS
TEST and LAND TEST.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
FAC/FM/FG BITE As the FAC and FG have a BITE in the CMD and the MONitor
(MON) sides, the fault analysis is generally made on each side and a
synthesis is made on the CMD side. Each BITE memorizes the result of the
analysis, the failure context, the flight leg number, the time and date
of each given failure. Then the BITE sends the result of the analysis,
with a maximum of two suspected LRUs in the order of probability, to the
FIDS.
FCU BITE Each FCU BITE computes the maintenance status of its related
part and permanently sends this maintenance data to the FG CMD part.
MCDU BITE The MCDU does the tests on its processor, memory and display
unit. If a failure is found by the MCDU BITE: - the FAIL annunciator
comes on and the display is blank, - the MCDU FAIL output discrete is
set and sent to the FM part and then to FG 1 and FG 2 CMD parts through
the crosstalk bus.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT SYS MAINTENANCE SYSTEM D/O (3) GROUND SCAN The GROUND
REPORT function displays failures recorded in the ground area of the
FIDS memory. The PRESENT FAILURE SCAN function is used to isolate
failures present when the function is selected. The manufacturer for
development purposes uses the PROGRAM page.
AFS TEST An AFS TEST is done: - to check an AFS LRU before removal, - to
check an AFS LRU after installation, - to get trouble shooting data
(even if the test is OK).
LAND TEST The LAND TEST gives the test availability of the LANDing mode
and equipment required to obtain CATegory 3. There are several
successive pages in which actions, checks and answers are requested from
maintenance.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT SYS MAINTENANCE SYSTEM D/O (3) SAFETY TESTS After long
term power interruption, computers and control units of the AFS do the
safety tests also called power-up tests. These tests are only done on
ground, except for the FCU, which can make safety tests on ground or in
flight. During these tests, no action should be done on the system. If a
unit does not pass the safety test, it is declared failed and unusable
and an ECAM message is displayed on the STATUS page. NOTE: The
recommended conditions to do the safety test are: . aircraft on ground,
engines stopped, hydraulic power (green/yellow) for FAC only, . pull the
C/B of the involved computer (both C/Bs for FCU), . wait 15 seconds (7
minutes for FCU), and then push the C/B of the involved computer, . wait
1 minute for safety test execution.
PROCEDURE This AFS maintenance procedure has to be followed in the event
of a pilot report concerning the AFS.

YAW AXIS CONTROL D/O (3) YAW DAMPER
RUDDER TRAVEL LIMITATION
When the AP is not engaged, the ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC)
calculates the yaw damper order with the normal law. The yaw damper
order calculated by the ELAC provides turn coordination; dutch roll
damping and engine failure compensation. If both ELACs fail, only the
dutch roll damping (alternate law) is computed by the Flight
Augmentation Computer (FAC) using the Air Data Inertial Reference System
(ADIRS) data. When the AP is engaged, the FAC calculates the yaw damper
order except in LANDing mode where it is computed by the Flight
Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC). When the AP is engaged: - dutch
roll damping law is given by the FAC using ADIRS data. - engine failure
compensation fast law is given by the FAC using the ADIRS data in
Take-Off/Go-Around (TOGA) or RunWaY modes only. - turn coordination law
computes the yaw order to the FMGC roll order. In LAND mode, the FMGC
yaw order controls the yaw damper actuators via the FAC.
The rudder travel limitation is computed by the FAC and sent to the
rudder travel limiting unit. The FAC rudder travel limiting law computes
this limit using the calibrated airspeed (Vc) given by the ADIRS.
OPERATION ELAC NORMAL LAW This schematic represents the ELAC normal law.
RUDDER TRIM The RUDder TRIM selector via the FAC controls the rudder
trim in manual mode. In the rudder trim auto mode, the FAC computes the
engine failure compensation and the turn coordination. When the AP is
engaged: - the turn coordination law computes the yaw orders related to
the FMGC roll order. Signals are simultaneously sent to the rudder trim
actuator and the yaw damper actuators. - the engine failure compensation
slow law orders are sent to the rudder trim actuator.

engaged, the yaw damper operates in the mode given below: - Dutch roll
damping - Turn coordination to reduce the sideslip in turn as a product
of the roll order from the FMGC. Additionally, for the rudder trim
operation in automatic mode the autopilot has priority thus, the manual
pilot trim is not possible in AP engaged configuration. The order for
rudder trim deflection is a product of the turn coordination and (in the
event of an engine failure) engine fail compensation. The AP also
provides signals which validate the detection of engine failure as a
function of the engine rating. In all cases the rudder trim deflection
is always indicated on the rudder trim control panel.

now include engine failure compensation in the event of an engine
failure. This mode provides lateral guidance function, at takeoff, on
the runway centerline by means of the LOC beam and by following an
optimum longitudinal flight path after rotation. This mode is
available: - for the FD during takeoff run and in flight - for the AP 5
seconds after lift-off. The mode is engaged when the pilot selects the
takeoff thrust by positioning the throttle control levers beyond the
MCT/FLX TO gate.

FAC ENGAGEMENT D/O (3) NORMAL CONFIGURATION
TEMPORARY POWER LOSS
In normal configuration, when the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC)
P/BSW is pressed in, the FAULT and OFF lights are off, provided the
internal monitoring channels are in good condition and the engagement
request is present. When the FAC P/BSW is released out, the FAC is
disengaged and the white OFF light comes on.
If a temporary power loss occurs, the FAULT light comes on with a
message on the ECAM. In flight, only the reset is possible by using the
FAC P/BSW.
NOTE: The FAC cannot be engaged on ground after power up during the 30
second test. The amber FAULT light flashes.
FAC NOT ENERGIZED OR NOT installed If the FAC is not energized and the
P/BSW is pressed in, the FAULT light is on with an amber message on the
ECAM.
SUBFUNCTION FAULT If one or several yaw axis control functions fail,
only the amber message appears on the ECAM. The FAULT light remains OFF.
If one or more of the following functions fail: - yaw damper, - rudder
trim, - rudder travel limitation. Only the amber message appears on the
ECAM display unit. The FAC remains engaged.
COMPUTER FAULT When the computer itself fails, the FAC is disengaged and
the FAULT light comes on with a message on the ECAM. In this case, a FAC
reset must be attempted following the ECAM procedure. NOTE: On ground
with engines shut down, the reset is automatic when the fault
disappears.

YAW DAMPER FUNCTION D/O (3) COMPONENTS
AUTO MODE
There are two yaw dampers. In normal operation, both are engaged but
only one is active. Yaw damper 1 has priority. The yaw damper function
is achieved by: - 2 electro-hydraulic actuators with an external
centering element. Each actuator comprises 1 jack, 1 Linear Variable
Differential Transducer (LVDT), 2 solenoid valves, 2 selector valves, 1
pressure switch and 1 Servo Valve (SV). - 2 Flight Augmentation
Computers (FACs). - 2 Rotary Variable Differential Transducers (RVDTs).
In AUTOmatic mode, the FAC computes the dutch roll damping in clean
configuration, the engine failure compensation in Takeoff/Go-Around
(TOGA) and RunWaY modes. The turn coordination law is computed by using
roll orders from the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC).
GENERAL
In manual mode, the AP is not engaged and the ELevator Aileron Computer
(ELAC) sends to the FAC: - the turn coordination, - the dutch roll
damping, - the engine failure compensation yaw orders.
MANUAL ALTERNATE After a dual ELAC failure, turn coordination and engine
failure compensation are lost. Only a simplified alternate law of dutch
roll damping is computed by the FAC.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
When the LANDing mode is engaged, the yaw order is computed directly by
the FMGC.
POWER LOOP
Yaw damper 1 and 2 operate with the changeover logic. The yaw damper
actuator does not move the rudder pedals. The yaw damper function
operates as follows: - order is computed by the laws and sent to the
rudder via the related yaw damper actuator. - yaw damper actuator 1 is
powered by the green hydraulic system. - yaw damper actuator 2 is
powered by the yellow hydraulic system.
MANUAL MODE
LAND MODE
The yaw damper laws control the SV, and the changeover logic controls
the two solenoids S1 and S2, which in turn control the selector valves
(H). S1 and S2 when powered, move the internal hydraulic parts to a
position, which makes it possible for the SV to operate the output jack.
If one of the selector valves fails or the signal from the FAC 1 fails,
the hydraulic Press switch sends a fail signal to the changeover logic,
which then transfer the operation to YD 2. The feedback in the power
loop is given by an LVDT for the command side and a RVDT for the monitor
side. In case of dual yaw damper loss, a centering spring rod moves the
rudder to the neutral position.
MONITORING At power up, the yaw damper function safety tests are
initiated. The continuity between the standby yaw damper and its SV is
tested. The computation is monitored by the comparators between command
and monitor part. The ELAC, FMGC and Air Data/Inertial Reference System
(ADIRS) peripheral inputs are always monitored. The power loop is
monitored by a comparator between the yaw order and the rudder position

feedback. In flight, the hydraulic pressures are monitored by the FAC.
The LVDTs and the RVDTs are always monitored.

FLIGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION D/O (3) GENERAL The function of the Flight
Augmentation Computer (FAC) is independent of the FAC engagement P/BSW.
This function gives: - characteristic speeds on the PFDs through the
Display Management Computers (DMCs), - the speed limits to the Flight
Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) for autoflight, - the
alpha-floor detection to the FMGCs for A/THR engagement, if it is not
engaged, - low energy awareness. The FAC also computes the weight and
the center of gravity.
SPEED COMPUTATION DISPLAY The speeds computed by the FAC are sent to the
PFD and the speed limits to the FMGCs. In normal operation, FAC 1 data
are displayed on the CAPT PFD and the FAC 2 data on the F/O PFD. If a
parameter or the computer fails, the associated PFD is automatically
switched to the opposite FAC by the DMC. If the air data source used by
the FAC is different from the data source used by the DMC for speed
display, the message ADR DISAGREE appears on the ECAM.
SPEED COMPUTATION Aerodynamic laws and the aircraft configuration
parameters are used for the characteristic speed computation. The
computation principle is based on the fact that most of the speed data
are a function of the aircraft weight. In flight, the FAC computes the
weight with the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS), FMGC and
Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC) parameters and then, from the weight,
it computes the characteristic speeds and the Center of Gravity (CG). On
the ground, the FAC uses the weight given by the FMGC.

FLIGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION D/O (3) ALPHA-FLOOR AND WINDSHEAR PROTECTION
Alpha-floor detection and windshear protection are computed by the FAC
or the ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) and sent to the FMGC. This
function is a protection of the aircraft against excessive
Angle-Of-Attack (AOA). The FAC compares the aircraft AOA (alpha) with
the predetermined threshold (function of the slat/flap configuration).
This threshold is decreased if windshear occurs. NOTE: If a windshear
condition is detected, the red WINDSHEAR message is displayed on the PFD
and the audio warning "WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR" starts. If this
threshold is exceeded, the FAC sends a signal to the FMGC to engage the
A/THR function and apply full thrust. If the aircraft is in clean
configuration, the windshear compensation function is not available. The
ELAC will start the alpha-floor protection if one of these conditions
occurs: - alpha protection condition and side stick deflection &gt; 14
degrees, - pitch angle &gt; 25 degrees and side stick deflection &gt; 14
degrees. If there is a failure of the two ADIRS, the alpha-floor
detection does not operate.

FLIGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION D/O (3) LOW ENERGY AWARENESS The energy
awareness is a software device which gives the crew an audio warning.
This warning tells the crew that it is necessary to increase the thrust
to get back a positive flight path angle through pitch control. The
audio warning, "SPEED SPEED SPEED", starts before alpha-floor in
relation to the AOA, to the configuration deceleration rate and to the
flight path angle. It is inhibited when RA is greater than 2000 ft or
when alpha-floor is active or when the aircraft is in clean
configuration.

this arrow gives the speed value, which will be attained in 10 seconds
if the acceleration or deceleration remains constant. This arrow appears
only when greater than 2 kts and is removed when less than 1 kt. It is
also removed in case of failure of the Flight Augmentation Computers
(FACs).
TARGET AIRSPEED This symbol is either magenta or cyan and gives the
target airspeed value or the airspeed corresponding to the Mach number.
The target airspeed value is the value computed by the Flight Management

entered on Flight Control Unit (FCU) for selected speed mode (cyan). The
target speed is a magenta double bar when associated with the ECONomy
speed range. Otherwise it is a magenta or cyan triangle. When out of
speed scale, the target speed value is displayed in numeric form below
or above the speed scale.
ECON SPEED RANGE In descent mode, with the ECON mode, the selected speed
symbol is replaced by two magenta half triangles on EIS 1 or by two
magenta thick lines on EIS 2: upper and lower limits calculated by the
FMGC. They indicate the range of descent speed: +20 kts and -20 kts or
Vmin or VLS whichever is higher.

computed by the FACs. The VLS corresponds to 1.13 Vs during take-off or
following touch and go. It becomes 1.23 Vs as soon as any flap or slat
selection is made. It remains at this value until landing. Above 20000
ft, VLS is corrected for Mach effect to maintain 0.2 g buffet margin.
VLS information is inhibited from touch down up to 10 seconds after
lift-off.
The top of a red and black strip along the speed scale defines the Stall
Warning Speed (VSW). It represents the speed corresponding to the stall
warning. VSW information is inhibited from touch down up to five seconds
after lift-off. The FACs computes the VSW in pitch alternate or pitch
direct law.
ALPHA PROTECTION SPEED The top of a black and amber strip along the
speed scale defines the alpha protection speed. It represents the speed
corresponding to the Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) at which alpha protection
becomes active. The FACs compute this speed in pitch normal law.
ALPHA MAX SPEED The top of a red strip along the speed scale defines the
alpha max speed. It represents the speed corresponding to the maximum
AOA that may be reached in pitch normal law. The FACs computes this
speed in pitch normal law.
VMAX It is defined by the lower end of a red and black strip along the
speed scale and determined by the FACs. Vmax represents the lowest of
the following values: - VMO (maximum operating speed) or the speed
corresponding to MMO (Maximum Operating Mach), - VLE (maximum landing
gear extended speed), - VFE (maximum flap extended speed).
DECISION SPEED (V1) The decision speed V1 is shown by a cyan symbol. The
crew through the Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU) manually
inserts the decision speed. When out of indication range, it is
digitally shown on the upper part of the scale. It is removed after
lift-off.
MINIMUM FLAP RETRACTION SPEED This speed is represented by a green -F
symbol. It is available when the flap selector is in position 3 or 2. It
is computed by the FACs.
MINIMUM SLAT RETRACTION SPEED This speed is represented by a green -S
symbol. It is available when the flap selector is in position 1. It is
computed by the FACs.
VFE NEXT Two amber dashes show the predicted VFE at the next flap/slat
position. It is given by the FACs and only displayed when the aircraft
altitude is below 15000 ft.
GREEN DOT This is the engine out operating speed in clean configuration.
It is displayed in flight only by a green dot. It represents the speed
corresponding to the best lift to drag ratio.

FAC WARNINGS (3) GENERAL
WINDSHEAR DET FAULT
All warnings in this lesson are generated by Flight Warning Computer
(FWC) logics, except for the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) P/BSW
amber FAULT light, which is controlled by the FAC itself.
When the windshear detection function is inoperative, the aural warning
sounds, the MASTER CAUTion comes on and the failure is shown amber on
the EWD page.
NOTE: -The phases of the flight phase inhibition schematic are FWC
phases, not Flight Management (FM) phases. -The status page is obtained
by pressing CLeaR or STatuS keys of the ECAM control panel. It does not
appear automatically after warning activation.
FAC 1+2 FAULT
LOW ENERGY WARNING The aircraft energy level is a function of current
speed, acceleration rate and flight path angle. When it becomes lower
than a threshold, under which the thrust shall be increased, an audio
"Speed-Speed-Speed" message is triggered every five seconds. This aural
warning indicates that, with the current thrust, it is not possible to
recover a positive flight path angle through pitch control. Thrust must
be then increased until warning disappearance or alpha floor is
triggered. This warning is available between 100 ft and 2000 ft out of
alpha floor conditions.
WINDSHEAR DETECTION The FACs achieve the windshear detection function
independently of the ON/OFF selection of the overhead panel FAC P/BSW.
The FACs trigger a red warning whenever windshear conditions are
encountered. The warning triggers: - an aural warning, WINDSHEAR,
repeated three times, - a WINDSHEAR red message displayed in the center
of both PFDs (15 seconds mini).
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
In case of FAC 1 and FAC 2 fault, the MASTER CAUT comes on, the aural
warning sounds, both FAC P/BSW FAULT lights come on amber and the "SPD
LIM" red warning is displayed on the speed scale of the PFD. The failure
is shown amber on the ECAM displays. The "OFF THEN ON" action performed
on a FAC P/BSW resets the computer if the fault disappears. An action on
the MASTER CAUT P/B cancels the MASTER CAUT light. If this fault occurs
on ground with engines shut down, the reset is automatic when the fault
disappears.
FAC 1(2) FAULT In case of FAC 1 or FAC 2 fault, the master caution comes
on; the aural waning sounds and the related FAC P/BSW FAULT light comes
on amber. The failure is shown amber on the displays. The "OFF THEN ON"
action performed on the FAC resets the computer if the fault disappears.
An action on the MASTER CAUT P/B resets the MASTER CAUT light.
RUD TRV LIM SYS FAULT In case of total rudder travel limitation system
failure, the MASTER CAUT comes on; the aural warning sounds and the
failure is shown amber on the displays. The "OFF THEN ON" action done on
the FAC P/BSW resets the computer if the failure disappears.

RUD TRV LIM 1(2) FAULT In case of rudder travel limitation 1 or 2
failure, an amber indication appears on the displays. No reset action is
needed in case of one rudder travel limitation failure, as the rudder
travel limitation function is not affected by a single rudder travel
limitation failure.
RUD TRIM SYS FAULT In case of total rudder trim system failure, the
MASTER CAUT comes on, the aural warning sounds and the failure is shown
amber on the displays.
RUD TRIM 1(2) FAULT In case of rudder trim 1 or 2 fault, an amber
indication appears on the displays. No reset action is needed in case of
one rudder trim fault, as the rudder trim function is not affected by a
single rudder trim failure.
YAW DAMPER SYS FAULT In case of total yaw damper system failure; the
MASTER CAUT comes on, the aural warning sounds and the failure is shown
amber on the displays. The "OFF THEN ON" action done on the FAC
pushbuttons resets the computer if the failure disappears.
YAW DAMPER 1(2) FAULT In case of yaw damper 1 or 2 failure, an amber
indication appears on the displays. No reset action is needed in case of
failure of one yaw damper.

FLIGHT GUIDANCE AUTOTHRUST D/O (3) GENERAL
A/THR DISENGAGED
The A/THR function can be manually engaged from the dedicated P/BSW on
the Flight Control Unit (FCU) or automatically when some conditions are
fulfilled.
When the A/THR function is disengaged: - the thrust levers control the
engines, - on the FCU, the A/THR P/BSW light is off, - the Flight Mode
Annunciator (FMA) displays neither the A/THR engagement status nor the
A/THR modes.
THRUST LEVERS The thrust levers are manually operated and electrically
connected to the Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADECs). NOTE:
The thrust levers never move automatically. Each lever has 3 sectors
defined by detents and stops. The thrust levers can be moved on a sector
which includes specific positions: - rear sector: for idle reverse up to
max reverse. - center section: 0: corresponds to an idle thrust, CL:
corresponds to a climb thrust. - forward section: FLX/MCT: corresponds
to a FLeXible take-off thrust or a Maximum Continuous Thrust after an
engine failure, TOGA: corresponds to a maximum Takeoff/Go Around thrust.
The FADECs compute the thrust limit, which depends on the position of
the thrust levers. If both thrust levers are in the same detent, the
thrust limit corresponds to this detent. If both levers are not in the
same detent, the thrust limit corresponds to the next higher detent. The
Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) select the highest
thrust limits of the FADEC 1 and FADEC 2 for thrust target computation.
A/THR FUNCTION LOGIC The A/THR function can be ENGAGED or DISENGAGED.
When it is engaged, it can be ACTIVE or NOT ACTIVE.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
CATTS Ltd
A/THR ENGAGED AND ACTIVE When the A/THR function is engaged, A/THR is
active if: - at least, one thrust lever is between the CL detent
(included) and the 0 stop (included), and, at the most, one thrust lever
is between the FLX/MCT detent and the CL detent, and there is no engine
in FLX TO mode, - or the alpha-floor protection is active independently
of the thrust lever positions. NOTE: In case of one engine failure, the
A/THR activation zone is between the FLX/MCT detent and the 0 stop,
instead of the CL detent, and the 0 stop. Because the A/THR function is
active: - the A/THR system controls the engines, - on the FCU, the A/THR
P/BSW light is on, - the FMA displays the A/THR engagement status in
white and the A/THR mode.
A/THR ENGAGED AND NOT ACTIVE When the A/THR function is engaged, A/THR
is not active if: At least one thrust lever is above the FLX/MCT detent,
or both thrust levers are above the CL detent, or at least one engine is
in FLX TO mode, with the alpha-floor protection not active. Because the
A/THR function is not active: - the thrust levers control the engines as
long as a thrust lever is outside the A/THR active area,
Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 84 of 142
- the A/THR P/BSW light is on, - the FMA displays the A/THR engagement
status in cyan and the MANual THRust rating in white, surrounded with an
amber box.

FLIGHT GUIDANCE AUTOTHRUST D/O (3) MODES
ALPHA-FLOOR PROTECTION
The A/THR function computes a thrust target according to modes and their
related reference parameters. The reference can be: - a speed or a mach
number; in this case, the source is either the FCU for a value chosen by
the pilot, or the FMGC itself, - a thrust; in that case, the sources
are: The FADECs which compute the thrust limit when the A/THR is not
active. The FMGC itself within the thrust limit always computed by the
FADECs when the A/THR is active. The A/THR modes are SPEED/MACH, THR,
RETARD, which can be overpassed by the alpha-floor protection.
The A/THR function protects against an excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA).
Each Flight Augmentation computer (FAC) detects the alpha-floor signal.
In case of excessive AOA or avoidance maneuver, the FACs send an order
to the FMGCs which activate the alpha-floor protection. The A/THR
automatically engages or stays engaged active and the engine thrust
becomes equal to the TOGA thrust for any thrust lever position. In this
condition, the green message A. FLOOR with an amber flashing box is
displayed on the FMA. When the alpha-floor detection is no longer
present in the FACs, the green message TOGA LK (LK for Lock) with an
amber flashing box is displayed on the FMA. The alpha-floor protection
can only be cancelled through the disengagement of the A/THR function.
MODES DESCRIPTION The choice of the mode is automatically made by the
FMGCs according to the active AP or Flight Director (FD) vertical mode.
This choice is based on a simple law: priority to the speed control. -
when the AP controls the aircraft speed with the elevators, the A/THR
has to control the engines by a fixed thrust demand (THR mode). - when
the AP controls another aircraft parameter (e. g. altitude), the A/THR
has to take care of the aircraft speed by a variable thrust demand to
the engines (SPEED/MACH mode). - Beside these two modes, RETARD is only
available in automatic landing when engine thrust has to be reduced to
idle for the flare phase below 40 feet RA.
A/THR OPERATION IN FLIGHT TAKE-OFF The aircraft is on ground and ready
for take-off. Neither the AP nor the A/THR are engaged. The engines are
controlled by the thrust levers. To take-off, the pilot sets the thrust
levers to the TOGA stop or to the FLX/MCT detent if a flexible
temperature is selected on a Multipurpose Control and Display Unit
(MCDU). This engages the A/THR function but it remains not active.
DEFAULT MODES
THRUST REDUCTION ALTITUDE
When no vertical mode is engaged, the A/THR operates only in SPEED/MACH
modes except: - when THR mode engages automatically in case of
alpha-floor protection activation, - when, A/THR being in RETARD mode,
the AP disengaged, the A/THR function remains in RETARD mode.
At the thrust reduction altitude, a message on the FMAs indicates to the
pilot that he has to set the thrust levers into the CL detent. As soon
as the thrust levers are in the CL detent, the A/THR is active. If a
thrust lever is set into the CL-MCT or O-CL area, a message on the FMAs
warns the pilot to set the thrust lever to the CL detent: - white LVR
CLB message if it is in the CL-FLX/MCT area, - amber LVR ASYM message if
it is in the O-CL area.

The A/THR remains active. Then, the thrust levers remain in this
position until the approach phase. When the A/C reach the thrust
reduction altitude, LVR CLB appears and flashing.
AUTOMATIC LANDING During automatic landing, before touch down, an auto
call out, RETARD, indicates to the pilot that he has to set the thrust
levers to the 0 stop. When he does it, the A/THR disengages. This lets
the automatic activation of ground spoilers if they are in armed
condition. Then, on ground, the pilot moves the thrust levers on the
REVerse sector.
DISCONNECTION Besides the normal A/THR operation, the A/THR function is
disengaged either by a pilot action or in case of a system failure. The
A/THR function can be disengaged either by pressing at least one of the
two red instinctive disconnect P/Bs on the side of the thrust levers or
by pressing the A/THR P/BSW on the FCU. A/THR disengagement can also be
triggered due to an external system failure. When the A/THR function is
active, the actual engine thrust does not necessarily correspond to the
thrust lever position.
DISCONNECTION CONSEQUENCES Consequently, it is important to know what
happens after an A/THR disconnection: When the disconnection is made by
the instinctive disconnect P/B, the thrust is immediately adjusted to
the thrust lever position. In other cases, after FCU P/BSW
disconnection, or failure: - when a thrust lever is in its detent, the
thrust on the corresponding engine is frozen at its last value just
before the disconnection (memo mode). - as soon as a thrust lever is
moved out the detent, or if it is not in a detent, the thrust on the
corresponding engine is smoothly adapted to the thrust lever position.

FLIGHT GUIDANCE PRIORITY LOGIC (3) FLIGHT GUIDANCE The engagement status
of the guidance function works on the master/slave principle. The master
Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) imposes all the changes
of AP/Flight Director (FD) modes and/or A/THR engagement to the slave
FMGC. Here is an example of a master FMGC. Look at the flow chart to
understand the priority logic. With no AP, no FD1 but FD2 engaged, FMGC2
is the master because, by following the flow chart, the first three
answers are NO, but the fourth one is YES.

FLIGHT GUIDANCE PRIORITY LOGIC (3) FLIGHT DIRECTOR At power up, both FDs
are normally engaged in split configuration. FMGC1 normally drives the
FD symbols (crossbars or flight path director symbols) on the CAPT PFD.
FMGC2 normally drives the FD symbols on the F/O PFD. The 1FD2 indication
is displayed on each Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) to show that FD1 is
engaged on CAPT side and FD2 is engaged on F/O side. If one FMGC fails,
the remaining FMGC drives the FD symbols on both PFDs. If FMGC1 fails,
the 2FD2 indication is displayed on each FMA to show that FD2 is
displayed on both PFDs. If both FDs fail, a red flag is displayed on
each PFD, provided that the corresponding FD switch is on. NOTE: In case
of loss of both FMGC, the ADIRS parameters can be optionally retrieved
using the back-up nav on the MCDU.

FLIGHT GUIDANCE PRIORITY LOGIC (3) AUTOPILOT If one AP is engaged, the
corresponding FMGC controls the flight controls through the Flight
Control Computers (FCCs). There is no priority logic in single
operation. The last engaged AP is the active one. Both APs can be
engaged as soon as the APPROACH mode is selected on the Flight Control
Unit (FCU). AP1 has priority, AP2 is in standby. The FCCs use the AP1
commands first. A switching is done to the AP2 commands in case of AP1
disengagement.

FLIGHT GUIDANCE PRIORITY LOGIC (3) AUTOTHRUST A single A/THR SW located
on the FCU is used for the engagement or disengagement of the A/THR
function. The A/THR function is, in fact, composed of two systems
(A/THR1 and A/THR2), which are ready to be engaged at the same time, but
only one system is selected. However, the selection of A/THR1 or A/THR2
depends on the engagement of the AP and FD. It is done according to the
master/slave principle, which is known by the FCU and summarized in the
table. When the selected A/THR function is active (according to the
thrust lever position), the master FMGC controls the engines, via the
FCU. Consequently, in automatic control, it is the same FMGC which
controls the engines and the flight controls. To recover the A/THR
function, when one AP is engaged and its own A/THR has failed, the
opposite AP should be engaged to switch from the master FMGC to the
other (which now becomes the master) and to switch to the opposite
A/THR.

FLIGHT CONTROL UNIT D/O (3) GENERAL This description only deals with the
central part of the Flight Control Unit (FCU). In general, the FCU
provides the short term interface between the crew and the Flight
Management and Guidance System (FMGS). The FCU is the main interface to
engage functions and guidance modes and to select parameters. NOTE: In
fact, there is one FCU panel which controls two identical processing
channels: FCU 1 and FCU 2. Only one channel is active at a time, the
other is in standby. If both channels fail, all FCU controls are
inoperative: A/THR, AP/Flight Director (FD) 1 and AP/FD 2 are not
available.
DISPLAY Here are listed some examples of function engagement, selection
of required guidance modes and flight parameters. The FCU allows: -
engagement of APs, FDs and A/THR, - selection of guidance modes;
e.g. HeaDinG, Vertical Speed (V/S) or TRacK, Flight Path Angle (FPA), -
selection and display of the various guidance targets whenever a manual
selection is required (SPeeD - HDG - TRK - V/S - FPA - ALT).

reference speed. - if not, there is no change in the window.
TURNED When turned, it changes the displayed speed. - if a speed was
previously displayed, the selected reference speed is modified. - if the
speed window was previously dashed, the first click changes the dashes
into the managed reference speed. When turned more, this value changes.
If the knob is not pulled within 45 seconds the display reverts to
dashes.
PUSHED When pushed, dashes are displayed and the associated managed
SPD/MACH dot light comes on. The FMGC uses a managed reference speed. -
if dashes are displayed, there is no change. - if a speed was previously

FLIGHT MANAGEMENT PRIORITY LOGIC (3) mode operation
fm operating modes There are three operating modes: NORMAL, INDEPENDENT
and SINGLE. At Flight Management (FM) initialization, that means at
power up, both FM parts exchange information. Initial cross-comparison
is made on the following parameters: Navigation database identification,
performance database identification, FM operational program
identification, aircraft program pin data and engine program pin data.
NORMAL MODE If the FM parts agree, normal mode is active. When keys are
pressed, they are immediately processed by both FMs, regardless of the
Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU) from which they originate.
INDEPENDENT MODE If the FM parts disagree, a white message FMS1/FMS2 A/C
STS DIFF is displayed on the MCDUs and the system then reverts to
independent mode. Each FM part manages its own MCDU. A failure in the
Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) inter system buses
results in an amber MCDU message INDEPENDENT OPERATION.
SINGLE MODE If one FM part has failed, a single mode is active. Both
MCDUs are driven by the remaining FM part. A white message OPP FMGC IN
PROGRESS is displayed on the MCDU corresponding to the failed FMGC.
NORMAL MODE In normal mode, the FM part receives the master/slave
activation from the Flight Guidance (FG) part. The master computer
imposes the following parameters upon the slave computer: - flight
phase, - flight plan sequencing, - active performance mode and speeds, -
clearance and maximum altitudes, - ILS frequencies and courses, if any.
After a flight plan change, there is a comparison on the active leg and,
every second, on the active performance mode and active guidance mode.
If it is different, the slave computer will synchronize itself to the
master computer by copying the master values. Also, aircraft position,
Gross Weight (GW) and target speeds from master and slave computers are
compared every second. If the difference is greater than 5 Nm, 2 tons or
2 Kts respectively, an appropriate message is displayed on the MCDUs: -
FMS1/FMS2 POS DIFF, - FMS1/FMS2 GW DIFF, - FMS1/FMS2 SPD TGT DIFF. Pilot
action is then required.
independent mode In independent mode, there is no interaction from one
system to the other one. The FMGCs only send their status information to
each other (e.g., in this case, the independent mode).
SINGLE MODE In single mode, both MCDUs are driven by the same FM part,
but they can still display different pages. Messages linked to the
navigation process are displayed on both MCDUs.

mcdu As already presented in the FM OPERATING MODES topic, the MCDUs
work differently. In normal mode, the MCDUs can be used simultaneously
on different pages. Any modification or entry on one MCDU is sent to the
other MCDU via the FMGC cross talk. In independent mode, both MCDUs
operate separately. Although the cross talk is present, an entry on one
MCDU is not applied to the other one. In single mode, both MCDUs
basically work as in normal mode, but with the valid FMGC only.
displays FM information is displayed on NDs and on PFDs. For FM
information, in normal or independent modes, FMGC1 supplies PFD1 and
ND1, FMGC2 supplies PFD2 and ND2. In single mode, the remaining FMGC
supplies all the displays.
radio navigation The schematic shows the architecture of the radio
navigation receivers controlled by the FMGCs in normal or independent
modes. For the selection of radio navigation frequencies and courses, in
normal or independent modes, each FMGC controls its own side receivers
through a Radio Management Panel (RMP). Only the actual frequencies and
courses from the receivers are displayed on the PFDs and the NDs. In
case of an FMGC failure, the valid FMGC controls its own side receivers
as usual, through an RMP, but also the other side receivers, directly
without going through a RMP. If both FMGCs fail, the crew must use the
RMPs to select the frequencies and courses.

FLIGHT PLANNING D/O (3) FLIGHT PLAN The flight plan is defined by
various elements, which indicate the routes the aircraft must follow
with the limitations along these routes. The elements are mainly taken
from the database or directly entered by the pilot. The limitations are
mainly speed, altitude or time constraints originated by the ATC. The
function that integrates these elements and limitations to construct a
flight plan is called flight planning. In addition to this, the Flight
Management (FM) part gives the aircraft position and the follow-up of
the flight plan, this is called navigation. Everything can be prepared
prior to the take-off but can also be modified quickly and easily during
the flight operation. In case of an FM problem, the remaining valid
Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) is used as sole source to
command both Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDUs) and NDs
after automatic switching.
NAVIGATION DATABASE The navigation database gives all necessary
information for flight plan construction and follow-up. The pilot will
either select an already assembled flight plan called COmpany ROUTE, or
will build his own flight plan, using the existing database contents.
This database has a tailored coverage, updated every 28 days. Some room
is kept to allow manual entry of 20 NAVigation AIDS, 20 waypoints, 10
runways and 3 company routes. NOTE: Optionally, aircraft are equipped
with the second generation of Flight Management System (FMS2). The room
kept allows manual entry of 20 NAVAIDS, 20 waypoints, 10 runways and 5
company routes. The database cannot be erased. However and as an option,
the manually entered data can be erased when the flight phase is over
(i.e. aircraft on ground for 30 seconds). Two cycle database can be
loaded and the selection is made automatically by using data from the
aircraft clock or
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
manually. The database loading into either FMGC is done with the help of
a Portable Data Loader (PDL) or via the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit
(MDDU) if installed. Then, the cross loading function allows database
loading into the other FMGC through crosstalk busses.
NAVIGATION The navigation process gives the system with current aircraft
state information consisting of present position, altitude, winds, true
airspeed and ground speed. This is achieved using inputs from the
Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), air data sensors, GPS, navigation
radios, Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) and Flight Augmentation Computer
(FAC) flight envelope computation. Position can be updated manually
during the flight or automatically, on the runway threshold at take-off
for example.
ACARS FUNCTION The FMS uses the Aircraft Communication Addressing and
Reporting System (ACARS) function to exchange data between the ground
station and the master FMGC via the ATSU. This interface makes the
exchange of flight plan initialization, take-off, wind, and broadcast
data and flight reports with the ground. Via the ACARS, the crew may
send a request for wind data to the ground. In response to this request,
or automatically, the ground sends climb, cruise, descent and alternate
wind data to the aircraft.
LATERAL FLIGHT PLAN The lateral flight plan gives the sequential track
changes at each waypoint within 3 main sections. - DEPARTURE: initial
fix (origin airport), Standard Instrument Departure (SID)... - EN ROUTE:
waypoints, NAVAIDS...

profiles. Fuel and time are the main actors in this particular part of
the FM function and direct the airline choice.
VERTICAL FLIGHT PLAN
According to the pilot selection on the EFIS control panel of the FCU,
the flight plan is shown in relation to the aircraft position on the
ROSE-NAV or ARC modes. The aircraft model is fixed and the chart moves.
The difference between the two modes is that the half range is available
when the ND is set to ROSE-NAV mode, as there is only frontal view when
it is set to ARC mode. In PLAN mode, the flight plan is shown, with
NORTH at the top of the screen, centered on the TO waypoint. Depending
on the selected range, the aircraft may or may not be visualized on this
display. The plan display can be de-centered by scrolling the flight
plan on the MCDU. The PFD shows the FM guidance following engagement of
the AP/Flight Director (FD) lateral and longitudinal modes.
The vertical flight plan gives an accurate flight path prediction, which
requires a precise knowledge of current and forecast wind, temperature
and the lateral flight path to be flown. The vertical flight plan is
divided into several flight phases: - PREFLIGHT: fuel, weight and V2
insertions, - TAKE-OFF: speed management, thrust reduction altitude,
acceleration altitude, - CLIMB: speed limit, speed management, - CRUISE:
top of climb, cruise altitude, top of descent, - DESCENT: speed limit,
speed management, deceleration, - APPROACH/MISSED APPROACH/GO AROUND:
thrust reduction altitude, acceleration altitude. The vertical steering
order can be followed by the pilot or the AP. Any level change in the
vertical profile is initiated after a pull or push action on the
altitude selector knob on the Flight Control Unit (FCU), except for
departure when the vertical profile is armed on ground and will
automatically be active after take-off phase.
DISPLAY
PERFORMANCE The performance database contains optimal speed schedules
for the expected range of operating conditions. Several performance
modes are available to the operator with the primary one being the
ECONomic mode. The ECON mode can be tailored to meet specific airline
requirements using a selectable Cost Index (CI). A CI is defined as the
ratio of cost of time to the cost of fuel. The Fuel Quantity and
Indication Computers (FQICs) give the fuel quantity. The speed and the
thrust values associated with a given CI are used to determine the climb
and descent

PERFORMANCE DATABASE OPTIMISATION (DPO) The DPO updates the Performance
Database of the aircraft Flight Management System (FMS) to enable
consistently more efficient descents by allowing the aircraft to remain
in the cruise phase longer and removing the 'level-off' stage at the
bottom of the descent, which reduces carbon emissions. In addition, the
Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) works in tandem with DPO to reduce
noise. The DPO function enables aircraft to use an optimum engine model
to compute the profile of the descent, requesting less fuel when the
engine is using idle thrust. In addition, it maximises the time spent at
efficient cruise level by setting the top of descent later in the
profile. Essentially what this means is that the aircraft stays at the
higher cruise altitude and effectively descends under its own natural
weight rather than flying a forced descent which is less fuel efficient
BASIC FUNCTIONS Fuel Savings DPO reduces fuel consumption, resulting in
proportional C02 and NOx reductions. Relaxing Idle Margin The level of
Idle considered to compute the descent profile is reduced resulting in a
less conservative slope Update engine performance model Using a more
accurate engine model allows to compute a more realistic descent
profile. The differences between managed and open descent are highly
reduced.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
Airbus describe the new software as its "Descent Profile Optimisation"
(DPO) function and this can be added to the FMC function software of all
legacy A320 ceo aircraft worldwide The enhancement to the aircraft's
on-board Flight Management System (FMS) performance database offers the
ability to generate fuel savings and reduce CO2 emissions. Optimisation
of an aircraft's flight trajectory is one of the key factors to further
improve efficiency in cooperation with Air Traffic Control. The DPO
function allows aircraft to descend from cruise altitude using only idle
engine thrust, which reduces fuel consumption, resulting in proportional
CO2 and NOx (nitrogen oxide emissions) reductions. To further enhance
fuel reduction, DPO maximises the time spent at efficient cruise level
-- by not starting the descent too early and subsequently minimising the
amount of time spent at an inefficient 'leveloff' stage at the bottom of
the descent -- when the aircraft's engines generate thrust to maintain
level flight in dense air prior to final landing approach. When
installed on the A320ceo aircraft, the DPO solution will help Airlines
achieve fuel savings per aircraft, per year, enabling even more
efficient operations particularly at constrained airports. In addition,
DPO will help us reduce CO2 emissions by many tons per aircraft, per
year, allowing Airlines to contribute towards more sustainable flight
operations. DPO is one of the several flight operations optimisation
solutions offered by Airbus and can be complemented by IDLE Factor
Optimiser (IFO), a cloud based solution service offered by flight
operations services subsidiary Navblue, to optimise aircraft
performance. Together with improved Air Traffic Management, these fuel
savings solutions enable operators in their decarbonisation journey.

NAVIGATION BACK-UP D/O (OPTION) (3) GENERAL The MCDU BACK-UP NAV (B/UP
NAV) must be used as a back-up system when both Flight Management (FM)
parts have failed.The MCDU BACK-UP NAV (B/UP NAV) gives to the crew
limited information, which can be used to complete the current flight.
The MCDU B/UP NAV is activated through the "SELECT NAV B/UP" prompt on
the MCDU MENU page. The B/UP NAV functions work independently and may be
activated separately.
FLIGHT PLANNING Before activation of the BACK-UP NAV function, a
condensed form of the flight plan is transferred from the FM part to the
MCDU. This downloading is updated in case of: - FM primary Flight Plan
(F-PLN) changes, - FM lateral leg sequencing, - FM long power off, - FM
source selector change, - FM resynchronization. Downloading includes
waypoint position, waypoint identifier, leg type, discontinuity, overfly
and turn direction information in a maximum of 150 legs. At BACK-UP NAV
activation, a last updating is done and then any other updating is
ignored. A reduced capability is given to the MCDU B/UP NAV function
compared to the FM function.
NAVIGATION The BACK-UP NAV function is based on Inertial Reference (IR)
inputs from the ownside IR or IR3, which gives the position, ground
speed, track, heading, altitude and wind. The selected IR depends on
pilot selection, through the IR source selector, to be consistent with
the current
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
displayed IR data on the related PFD and ND. The MCDU B/UP NAV gives,
the crosstrack error and the bearing/distance/time to go to the active
waypoint, depending on the aircraft latitude/longitude and on the active
leg of the flight plan. It supplies the automatic leg change when the TO
waypoint is reached. It is very important to note that all this data is
only for display, there is no steering order issued by the MCDU, and the
NAV mode cannot be engaged.
ND DISPLAY The MCDU transmits the BACK-UP F-PLN to the NDs. It has
active F-PLN vectors and waypoints related to the fixed aircraft
position in ROSE or ARC modes, or to the moving aircraft reference in
PLAN mode. In all cases, the flight plan line is dashed in green (as NAV
mode cannot be engaged). Options selectable on the EFIS control panel
are not allowed (AiRPorT, Non-Directional Beacon, VOR.D, WayPoinT,
ConSTRaint).
MCDU PAGE AVAILABILITY All flight-planning operations are directly
applied through the B/UP F-PLN page. It displays each leg of the active
route, giving position information for each waypoint, as well as
computed course, time and distance for the connecting legs. The
revisions, available on the B/UP F-PLN page, are: - waypoint
insertion, - waypoint deletion, - discontinuity deletion, - overfly
deletion/insertion. Pressing the DIR key enables the selection of a
waypoint to join it directly. The B/UP F-PLN/DIR TO page is similar to
the F-PLN page but line 1 is reserved for waypoint entry. Pressing the
PROGress key gives navigation information. The B/UP PROG page displays
the aircraft position with identification of the selected

IR. It also gives ground speed, and active leg track with aircraft
track. The top line displays the waypoint identifier and altitude at the
last sequenced waypoint, also called overhead (OVHD). The bottom line
enables access to the B/UP IRS pages. The B/UP IRS pages correspond to
IR1 or 2, function of MCDU1 or 2, and IR3. IR provides, for display
information about position, the true track, the true and magnetic
headings, the ground speed and the wind.
DEACTIVATION Backup Navigation is deactivated upon one of the following
events: - The Deselect NAV B/UP prompt is pushed on the MCDU MENU page -
The following condition becomes true: onside FM is Healtly and offside
FM is failed - The FM subsystem is selected via its menu text prompt on
the MENU page. When Backup navigation is not available, no Select NAV
B/UP nor Deselect NAV B/UP prompt is displayed. The field is blank. Upon
Backup Nav deactivation, the Backup Nav functions are disabled and the
FM is given back control of the Nav Display.

FMGS WARNINGS (3) GENERAL
NOTE:
All warnings in this lesson are generated by Flight Warning Computer
(FWC) logics, except for some cases, which are indicated.
BOTH FD'S FAILURE
NOTE: - the phases of the flight phase inhibition schematic are FWC
phases not Flight Management (FM) phases, - the status page is obtained
by pressing CLeaR or STatuS keys of the ECAM control panel. It does not
appear automatically after warning activation.
In case of non-engagement or disengagement of both Flight Directors
(FDs) not due to an action on the FD P/BSWs, a red FD flag appears on
both PFDs. The FD failure can be internal or due to peripherals. This
warning is not generated by the FWC but by a Display Management Computer
(DMC) logic. The red FD flag on a given PFD is inhibited when the
corresponding FD P/BSW, located on the EFIS control panel of the Flight
Control Unit (FCU), is off.
AP OFF The AP loss warning is divided into two cases. First, when the AP
loss is due to an action on a take over P/BSW. The second case is when
the AP loss is due to another reason than an action on a take over
P/BSW.
ACTION ON TAKE OVER PUSHBUTTON The visual and associated audio warnings
are temporary: - the red MASTER WARNing light flashes for 3 s, - the red
AP OFF message is displayed for 9 s, - the cavalry charge aural warning
sounds for 1.5 s. Pressing the MASTER WARN P/BSW or a second action on
the take over P/BSW immediately cancels the MASTER WARN flashing and the
red AP OFF message; the cavalry charge is cancelled only after 0.5 s. An
AP re-engagement cancels everything at once.
OTHER REASON If the two APs are engaged and just one is lost, the
warning is not triggered. An action on the MASTER WARN P/BSW or on the
take over P/B cancels the MASTER WARN flashing and the red AUTO FLT AP
OFF message; the cavalry charge is cancelled only after 1.5 s. A
successful re-engagement of the AP cancels everything at once.
Either AP1+2 or AP1 or AP2 is displayed on the status page.
FCU 1+2 FAULT In case of FCU 1 and FCU 2 fault, the MASTER CAUTion comes
on; the aural warning sounds and the failure is shown amber on the
displays. NOTE: The STATUS messages are never inhibited.
FCU 1(2) FAULT In case of FCU 1 or FCU 2 fault, the related amber
indication appears on the displays. NOTE: The STATUS messages are never
inhibited.
A/THR OFF The A/THR loss warning is divided into two cases. First, when
the loss is due to an action on an instinctive disconnect P/BSW or to a
thrust levers setting on idle performed above 50 ft. The second case is
when the loss of the A/THR function is due to any other reason.
PILOT ACTION The warnings are temporary:

- the amber MASTER CAUT light goes off after 3 s, - the amber A/THR OFF
message disappears after 9 s. The MASTER CAUT light and the amber A/THR
OFF message are cancelled by an action on the MASTER CAUT P/BSW or on an
instinctive disconnect P/BSW or by an A/THR re-engagement. NOTE:
The amber message: A/THR OFF displayed on the EWD is not inhibited by
any flight phase.
OTHER REASON The MASTER CAUT light and the amber AUTO FLT A/THR OFF
message are cancelled by an action on the MASTER CAUT P/BSW or on an
instinctive disconnect P/B or by an A/THR re-engagement. NOTE:
This warning is not triggered when the thrust levers are set on idle
below 50 ft. As the A/THR is OFF and the engine thrust is locked, the
thrust levers have to be moved. If the thrust levers are not moved
within 5 seconds, an additional repetitive warning is triggered every 5
seconds.
A/THR LIMITED When the A/THR is active and the thrust levers are below
the CLimb detent, the MASTER CAUT comes on and a repetitive warning is
triggered every 5 seconds until the levers are put back in this detent.
In case of one engine out, the same principle applies except that the
Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) detent replaces the CL detent.
AUTOLAND The AUTOLAND red warning tells the pilot that, depending on the
procedures, he has to do a go-around or a manual landing. This warning
can only be activated in LANDing mode with at least one AP engaged. The
AUTOLAND red warning is triggered in the following cases: - both APs OFF
below 200 ft RA,
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500)
-   When following ILS beams, in case of a LOCalizer excessive deviation
    (1/4 dot above 15 ft RA) or GLIDE excessive deviation (1 dot above
    100 ft RA). LOC and GLIDE scales flash on the PFD,
-   loss of LOC signal above 15 ft or loss of GLIDE signal above 100 ft.
    The FD bars flash on the PFD. The LAND mode remains engaged. A
    triple click aural warning is generated in the event of landing
    capacity downgrading. The warning is cancelled by LOC mode or AP
    disengagement or by doing a go-around. NOTE: A warning test can be
    done by pressing the captain or the first officer AUTOLAND P/BSW.
CAPACITY CHANGE The warning corresponding to a landing capacity
downgrading is an aural warning and messages on the status page. This
flight phase inhibition just concerns the triple click aural warning. It
is triggered when there is a downgrading of landing capacity or when the
LAND mode is disarmed or disengaged. Messages on the status page can
always be displayed except when the system is in LAND mode (armed or
active) and except in phase 1 or 10. NOTE: In LAND mode, the landing
category is displayed on the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) of the PFD.
ALTITUDE ALERT The altitude alert takes into account the difference
between the aircraft altitude and the reference altitude selected on the
FCU. It has an effect on the altitude window of the PFD and can trigger
the C-chord aural warning. The altitude alert is inhibited by Glide
Slope (G/S) capture and canceled by turning the FCU altitude knob, or by
setting the landing gear lever to DOWN with slats extended or when the
landing gear is downlocked.
