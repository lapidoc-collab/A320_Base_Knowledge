SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE TASKS &amp; CHECKS in MPD
This Chapter 05-20-00 "Life Limits and Maintenance Checks" is now
covered in the Maintenance Planning Document (MPD). The MPD is the
repository document for all repetitive scheduled maintenance tasks
declared by Airworthiness Directives (AD/CN), All Operator Telex (AOT),
Inspection Service Bulletins (ISB), Service Information Letters (SIL),
and Modifications (MOD/SB) and analyzed under the Maintenance Review
Board (MRB).
UN-SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE in AMM Section 05-50-00 This Chapter 05-50-00
includes the maintenance checks that you must do when a flight crew
report shows abnormal flight conditions. Such maintenance actions are
divided into two categories of information: - inspections, - checks.

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) SCHEDULED REPETITIVE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH MPD
The main objective of the MPD document is to provide maintenance
planning information necessary for each operator to develop a customized
maintenance program. MPD reflects all repetitive scheduled maintenance
tasks declared by AD/CN, AOT, ISB, SIL, and MOD/SB and analyzed under
the MRB. A typical scheduled repetitive task (Integrated Drive Generator
(IDG) scavenge filter) is listed with the following data: - the
threshold interval, source document, cross-references to other manuals
or documents (Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) and SIL), - Man Hours
required to accomplish the work, - the applicability in this Envelope
document. Note the Zonal inspection, requested by C CHECK interval, on
the tension of the fan cowl latches, the AOT, AMM and SIL
cross-referenced. Some maintenance tasks have a higher ranking of
requirement, when the maintenance requirement is identified as: -
"Airworthiness Limitations Item" (ALI) or "Life limit parts", -
"Certification Maintenance Requirements" (CMR). The approved document
MRB REPORT Appendix 1 lists all these airworthiness approved issues, the
ALIs and CMRs. The MPD details these airworthiness related items in the
"Time controlled Items" and "Life Limits" sections. It is the
responsibility of each operator to adjust his own maintenance program in
accordance with his National Authority.

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) LIFTING AND SHORING: JACKING - GENERAL Three
jacking points, when equipped with jacking pads, are used to lift the
aircraft. The forward point "A" is located forward of the nose landing
gear. The points "B" are located outboard of the engine pylons. A safety
stay must be positioned at the rear of the aircraft after jacking to
stabilize the aircraft. You can lift the aircraft at the forward jacking
point only, with the wheels of the main landing gear on the ground. When
the aircraft is weighed on landing gear jacks the following jacking
points must be used to lift it. - 2 jacking points located in the main
landing gear, - 1 jacking point located in the nose landing gear.
LIMITATIONS The open air jacking operation is limited if the wind
velocity exceeds permissible values which depend on aircraft gross
weight and center of gravity position. In any condition, the aircraft
must be pointing upwind.
The LH, RH and nose jack pad adapters are different and must not be
interchanged. Those for the A321 are also different from those of the
other aircraft and must not be interchanged.
SHORING Shoring is necessary to give support to the wing in order to
release the loads on the structure when you do major work or
modifications. The AMM shoring procedure gives the general principle
only. Use the detailed shoring instructions given in: - SRM 51-51-50,
when shoring is required for specific Airbus repairs. - ARM 3-28, when
shoring is required for recovery of the aircraft.
SHORING OF THE AIRCRAFT
PRECAUTIONS Before you lift the aircraft, you must be sure that the
ground safety-locks are in position on the landing gears and the weight
of fuel is applied equally on the two sides of the aircraft centerline.
The three jacks must be operated together. When the jacking operation is
completed, install the safety stay to make the aircraft stable. Do not
use the safety stay to lift the aircraft. The safety stay must be
removed for the gear swing.
First you must lift the aircraft, refer to the AMM 07-11-00. Put SHORES
in position below the wing front spar and rear spar. For detailed
instructions refer to the SRM 51-51-00. Make sure that the wing touches
the shores.
JACKING POINTS Put jacking pads below the jacking points to apply the
loads equally. NOTE: It is necessary to use the jack pad adapters when
the aircraft is put on jacks.

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) LEVELING AND WEIGHING WEIGHING You can weigh
the aircraft with: - the aircraft on jacks, - the aircraft on its
wheels, - the aircraft on landing gear jacks. Load cells on each jack or
platform scales are used for weighing.
QUICK LEVELING PROCEDURE WITH THE ADIRU First, follow the Inertial
Reference (IR) alignment procedure. Then on the MCDU scratchpad the
alpha call-up code has to be entered: - PTCH for the pitch angle to do a
check of the longitudinal alignment, - ROLL for the roll angle to do a
check of the transverse alignment. To start this procedure, first of all
the aircraft must be lifted. After that, read the pitch and roll angles
in the MCDU scratchpad. Then operate the hydraulic jack below the wing
to get the transverse alignment. Then operate the forward hydraulic jack
to get the longitudinal alignment. When you have done the longitudinal
alignment, do a check of the transverse alignment.

METHOD) The quick leveling with a spirit level is an alternative method
of leveling while the ADIRUs are not available (no power supplied to the
aircraft) and no attitude monitors are installed. For this method two
persons are necessary: - one in the cargo compartment to move the spirit
level, - another one near the aircraft to operate the jacks. While the
aircraft is being lifted, put a spirit level on a track: - in the Y
axis, perpendicular to the tracks, and operate the hydraulic jack below
the wing to get the transverse alignment, - in the X axis, and operate
the forward hydraulic jack to get the longitudinal alignment. When you
have done the longitudinal alignment, do a check of the transverse
alignment.

THE ATTITUDE MONITOR On older aircraft there was also the attitude
monitor; To ensure that excessive side loads are not placed on the jacks
and on the aircraft structure, a quick leveling check must be carried
out during the jacking operation. The procedure consists in operating
the jacks of the aircraft to move the bubble to the D4 position in the
attitude monitor, which is located in the Refuel/Defuel control panel
recess. The D4 position corresponds to a longitudinal angle of 0 degrees
and a lateral angle of 0 degrees.

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) TOWING (continued) TOWING WITH THE NOSE GEAR
FROM THE FRONT This film describes how to push the A/C rearwards or tow
the A/C forwards with the nose gear. The A/C may be towed or pushed
back: - at maximum ramp weight, - with the engines shut down or running
at idle. To begin the procedure, make sure: - that the safety devices
are installed on the landing gears (L/G), - the wheel chocks are in
place, - and check if the parking brake is ON. Do not tow the A/C if the
dimension H is more than 300 mm (11.8 in). If you do, you can cause
damage to the internal centering cams of the nose landing gear (NLG).
Referring to your A/C maintenance manual, make sure that the A/C is
stable. Let us suppose that this procedure has been correctly done.
During this procedure, depending on the configuration you are in, the
A/C needs to be energized either by using the APU, a specific ground
cart, an engine running, or by using the tractor itself. Let us suppose
that the A/C is already energized and the EIS start procedure done.
Outside, on the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, set the
ground-towing control lever to the towing position and install the pin.
In the cockpit, - on the upper ECAM page, the "Nose.WHEEL STEERinG
DISConnected" message comes into view on the memo page. - check on the
Yellow brake-pressure triple-indicator that the accumulator pressure
pointer is in the green range. We recommend pressurizing the yellow
hydraulic system using the yellow electrical pump, thus, the braking
system will be more efficient and safer. Now, we have to install the tow
bar.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
CATTS LTD
CAUTION: Caution: make sure that the tow bar has: - a damping system - a
calibrated shear pin - two calibrated turn shear pins. This is to
prevent high loads causing damage to the L/G. Refer to your A/C
maintenance manual for the calibration of these pins. On the NLG,
install the tow bar on the tow fitting and connect the tow bar to the
tractor. CAUTION: Caution: put the parking brake control switch in the
off position before you tow or push back the A/C. This is to prevent
high loads causing damage to the NLG. On the Yellow brake-pressure
triple-indicator, the brakes pressure pointers go down. In the cockpit,
set the lighting system: - set the exterior light navigation and logo
switch to ON. - at night, set the interior light dome switch to bright
and if the anti-collision lighting is necessary for the local airport
regulations or the airline procedures, set the exterior light beacon
switch to ON. On the VHF system: - in order to communicate with the
control tower during towing operations, release out the VHF pushbutton
switch and select the control tower frequency on the radio management
panel. - in order to communicate with the ground mechanics, on the audio
control panel, set the interphone radio switch to the interphone
position and release out the interphone reception pushbutton. For safety
reasons, a distance of 3 meters (10 ft) must be kept clear around the
nose wheels, tow bar and tractor when the aircraft moves. Towing speed
limitation depends on the position of the passenger/crew and cargo
doors. For these speed limitations refer to your A/C maintenance manual.

The maximum permitted steering angle on each side of the A/C centerline
is 95 degrees. When you use the front fittings to push the A/C rearwards
with engine at idle this angle is limited to 40 degrees. At this point,
be sure that all warnings and cautions of your A/C maintenance manual
procedure and previous precautions are applied. Now, the A/C can be
towed slowly and smoothly. Two other persons have to monitor the wing
tips during the towing operation and one person is required in the
cockpit in order to operate the brakes. When you complete the towing
operation, make sure that the nose wheels are aligned with the A/C
centerline. Inform the cockpit to apply the parking brake, and check
that the parking brake light is ON on the nose wheel steering
deactivation electrical-box. Put the wheel chocks in position.
Disconnect the tow bar from the nose gear fittings. On the nose wheel
steering deactivation electrical-box, remove the safety pin and set the
ground-towing control lever to the normal position. At the same time, in
the cockpit, on the ECAM memo display the message "N.WHEEL STEERG DISC"
disappears. On the lighting system: - reset the exterior light beacon
and navigation &amp; logo switches to OFF. - reset the interior light dome
switch to OFF. On the communication system: - cut the cockpit/control
tower VHF link by pressing in the VHF pushbutton on the radio management
panel. - reset the interphone radio switch to the neutral position.
Depressurize the yellow hydraulic system, do the EIS stop procedure and
de-energize the A/C electrical circuits.

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) PARKING AND MOORING (continued) MOORING OF
THE AIRCRAFT The function of mooring is to prevent damage to the
aircraft on ground in high wind conditions. For wind speeds less than 50
kts: - Mooring is not necessary if the aircraft configuration is in the
limits given in AMM chapter 05-57-00. If the aircraft points into the
wind and wind speed is: - Between 50 and 70 Kts, moor the aircraft at
the NLG, - More than 70 Kts, moor the aircraft at the NLG and MLG. If
the aircraft does not point into the wind or the direction of the wind
is not stable: - For wind speeds or gusts of more than 50 Kts, moor the
aircraft at the NLG and the MLG.

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) PLACARDS AND MARKINGS The ATA 11 gives the
location and illustrations of the placards, stencils and markings on the
A/C (internal or external side). The placards and markings on the A/C
give the data and instructions related to safety and maintenance. Some
of these placards and markings are necessary to obey the regulation used
for the Airbus aircraft type certification (JAR 25). There are
identified by a flag note as follows: NOTE (1) REQUIRED BY REGULATION.
This example is extracted from the AMM chapter 11-21-52: Passenger

SA INTRODUCTION MODULE (1) STANDARD PRACTICES - FIN PRESENTATION
Equipment on the A/C is identified by a unique identifier designated the
Functional Item Number (FIN). Used in numerous manuals, the FIN uniquely
identifies an item performing a function in an A/C system. The FIN is
composed of: - a two-letter code indicating to which system and circuit
the equipment belongs to, - prefix (sequence number) and/or suffixes
which provide the unique identification for individual items of
equipment, the prefix indicating the position in the circuit. An item
performing the same function in the same system throughout the A/C can
have the same basic FIN with different suffix numbers, (generally odd
numbers for left hand side, even numbers for right hand side). A
complete list of system/circuit identifiers is given in the introduction
of the wiring manuals - Aircraft Schematic Manual (ASM)/Aircraft Wiring
Manual (AWM). Here is an example of a list of the circuit
identifications.
