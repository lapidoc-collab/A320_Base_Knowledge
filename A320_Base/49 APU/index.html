APU SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The Auxiliary Power
Unit (APU) is a constant speed gas turbine engine. It is located in the
unpressurized tail cone. The APU is a self-contained unit, which enables
the aircraft to be independent of external pneumatic and electrical
power sources. The constant-speed gas turbine engine drives the
accessory gearbox and a load compressor. The APU provides: - electrical
power for the aircraft systems, - bleed air for engine starting (MES),
air conditioning (ECS) and wing anti ice testing on ground (not GTCP
36-300), - bleed air for air conditioning and pressurization in flight
until the specified manufacturer limit. The APU is designed to operate
throughout the entire flight envelope. Electrical power is available
whenever the APU operates, but bleed air is shut off above the specified
manufacturer limit. The APU has an air intake flap. The intake flap is
open when the APU master switch is selected ON and closes when the
master switch is selected OFF. When open, it provides air to the APU
inlet for combustion and pneumatic supply.

APU INSTALLATION PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL
ACCESS DOORS
The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is installed in a fireproof COMParTment
(COMPT) located in the fuselage tail cone.
Two access doors allow access to the APU COMPT. The access doors on the
bottom of the tail cone open outwards to allow the APU to be inspected,
lifted and lowered.
MOUNTS Seven tie rods attach the APU to the structure brackets on the
APU COMPT ceiling. These tie rods also connect to the APU three-point
mounted suspension system. Vibration isolators are installed between the
APU mount brackets and the tie rods to reduce the transmission of A/C
vibrations and shocks to the APU. The isolators also prevent the
transmission of vibrations from the APU to the A/C structure.
DRAIN SYSTEM A drain system prevents the collection of fluids in the APU
COMPT. Any fluid that may accumulate in the APU COMPT is delivered to a
drain mast. Some of the fluids are collected in a drain tank in the APU
COMPT, which is emptied through the drain mast when the A/C is above 200
kt.
AIR INTAKE FLAP The air intake system ducts ambient air to the APU
plenum chamber. An air intake flap cuts off the air supply when the APU
does not operate. In case of failure, the air intake flap can be opened
or closed manually by a manual override device.
AIR INTAKE DUCT The air intake duct, which is composed of a diffuser and
elbow, provides correct airflow to the APU plenum. The air intake duct
is attached to the right access door.
EXHAUST The exhaust system lets the APU exhaust gas flow into the
atmosphere and muffles the noise from the exhaust. The exhaust muffler
thermal insulation protects the A/C structure.

APU DRAIN SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) Apu Drain System
TURBINE PLENUM DRAIN
A drain system prevents the collection of fluids in the Auxiliary Power
Unit (APU) system and compartment.
A turbine plenum drain orifice is provided to drain fuel that may
accumulate in the combustor following an unsuccessful light-up. The fuel
is drained directly overboard through the drain mast.
FUEL CONTROL UNIT/OIL PUMP SEAL DRAIN The fuel and oil pump seal drain
line is routed via a collector line to the drain tank. This line drains
fuel or oil leaks.
INLET GUIDE VANE ACTUATOR DRAIN The Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) actuator
drain line is routed via the collector line to the drain tank. This line
drains only fuel leaks.
GEARBOX VENT The oil reservoir has a connection to the ambient air
through an air/oil separator. The gear driven air/oil separator is
connected through a gearbox vent line to the APU exhaust cone.
SURGE CONTROL VALVE DRAIN The surge control valve fuel is drained into
the drain tank by the Fuel Control Unit (FCU)/IGV actuator common drain
line.
LOAD COMPRESSOR CAVITY DRAIN
EXHAUST MUFFLER DRAIN The exhaust muffler drain line is routed to the
drain mast. This drain line collects water or cleaning fluid.
APU COMPARTMENT DRAIN Water coming from rain or condensate humidity,
cleaning agents and any oil and fuel in the compartment, due to leaks or
APU servicing, are drained to the lowest point of the APU door and
through the drain mast overboard.
DRAIN TANK For venting and evacuation, the drain tank is connected to
the drain mast. Airflow across the drain mast creates a vacuum in the
drain line. The suction effect produced at 200 kts, is sufficient to
remove the contents of the drain tank. A vent line ventilates the drain
tank and drain lines. The APU drain lines are connected to the right
access door drain lines through spring adapter kiss seals.
To prevent any ingestion of oil in the bleed system the load compressor
bearing cavities are kept dry by buffering air into the main shaft
seals. An oil leak witness drain is located aft of the seal to collect
any oil leakage. The oil is drained directly overboard through the drain
mast.

APU BASIC DESCRIPTION (3) - a dual alloy second stage rotor, - an
annular exhaust diffuser.
GENERAL The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is of a modular design. The three
APU modules are: - the power section, - the load compressor, - the
accessory drive gearbox.
ENGINE COMPRESSOR The compressor is of a single stage centrifugal
compressor design. The main components of the compressor are: - a single
stage centrifugal impeller, - single stage diffuser vanes, - axial
de-swirl vanes.
COMBUSTION CHAMBER The combustion chamber is of a reverse flow annular
design and is installed inside the turbine plenum. The main parts of the
combustion chamber are: - the inner combustion chamber shell, - the
outer combustion chamber shell. The following components are installed
on the combustion chamber: - an igniter plug, - 10 dual orifice fuel
nozzles.
TURBINE
The load compressor is of a single-stage centrifugal design. It supplies
bleed air to the pneumatic system. The primary components of the load
compressor are: - the inlet guide vane assembly, - the load compressor
impeller, - the load compressor diffuser, - the load compressor scroll.
The shaft is held with two bearings: one duplex ball bearing in front of
the load compressor impellor and one roller bearing aft of the
second-stage turbine. As an option, the duplex ball bearing is made of
ceramic to make the bearing more resistant to damage caused by debris
that go into the bearing compartment.
INLET GUIDE VANES The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) control the amount of
bleed air flow and pressure from the APU load compressor. The 16 IGVs
are moved simultaneously by a gear train operated by an actuator. The
IGV actuator is operated by high-pressure fuel supplied from the Fuel
Control Unit (FCU). The IGV opening angle depends on the bleed air
demand for: - Main Engine Start (MES) system, - Environmental Control
System (ECS).
ACCESSORY GEARBOX
The turbine assembly drives the engine compressor, the load compressor
and the gear train of the Accessory Gearbox (AGB). The two-stage axial
flow turbine includes: - a cooled first stage nozzle, - inserted first
stage rotor blades, - an un cooled second stage stator,

APU IGNITION &amp; STARTING D/O (3) STARTER CONTROL During starting, the
electrical starter causes initial rotation of the Auxiliary Power Unit
(APU) shaft when it drives the Accessory Gearbox (AGB). When the APU
speed is around 50%, the Electronic Control Box (ECB) stops the
electrical supply to the starter by opening the main start contactor.
The main start contactor 5KA and the backup start contactor 10KA are
heavy duty contactors that switch electrical current to the starter
motor. During Ram Air Turbine (RAT) extension, APU starting is inhibited
by the Battery Charge Limiters (BCL 1 and BCL 2), which prevent
operation of the main start contactor 5 KA by removing the necessary
ground signal, to operate the Main Start Contactor, from the MASTER SW.
IGNITION CONTROL The ignition system causes initial light-off of the
fuel air mixture. The ignition system includes an ignition box that
energizes an igniter plug. During starting, the ECB switches the
ignition to ON between 0% and 60%. When the APU speed drops below 95%
due to a flame-out, the ECB starts the ignition until the APU reaches
again 100% of speed.

pushed through the primary nozzles for better engine acceleration.
FUEL SUPPLY Two fuel manifolds and 10 dual fuel-nozzles supply fuel.
Each fuel-nozzle has a primary and a secondary fuel orifice. When APU
start is selected, the primary fuel orifice is supplied and when the
fuel pressure is more than 125 psig the check valve in the flow divider
assembly opens to supply the secondary fuel orifice. During on-speed
operation, the two orifices are supplied.

APU OIL SYSTEM D/O (3) - or the A/C altitude is above 10,000 ft
(P2\&lt;10,1 psia), - or the APU fuel temperature is below -12.2°C (+10°F).
The valve is energized open during every APU shutdown between 50% and 7%
speed.
GENERAL The oil system of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) lubricates and
decreases the temperature of the power section, load compressor, gearbox
and AC generator. This system is made of: - storage, - supply, -
scavenge, - venting, - control, - protection, - monitoring.
PROTECTION The ECB gives protection to the APU if there is an oil system
malfunction. The ECB monitors oil pressure and oil temperature. If one
of the oil parameters is out of limit, the ECB starts an automatic APU
shutdown without time delay: - gearbox high oil temp threshold: 162.78°C
(325°F), - oil low pressure: 33 psi. The ECB also stops the APU if a
delta pressure switch at the scavenge filter or at the lubrication
filter shows impending filter clogging.
STORAGE
MONITORING
The sump of the APU Accessory Gearbox (AGB) is the oil reservoir. The
AGB sump contains 6.26 l (1.65 US gal) of oil. The oil reservoir can be
filled by gravity or by pressure. The AGB has: - an oil fill cap for
gravity filling, - optional pressure oil servicing with a pressure fill
and overfill port, - an oil-level sight glass with FULL and ADD marks, -
a magnetic chip detector and oil drain plug installed at the lowest
point of the AGB, - an oil heater.
The oil system is monitored to increase the APU life. The oil sump is
installed with a low-level switch to show maintenance information in the
cockpit. When the level is at the "ADD" mark 4.60 l (1.22 US gal), the
APU can continue to operate for 10 hours maximun. This changes with the
different operating attitudes of the A/C in flight. A magnetic drain
plug, put fully in the APU oil, lets the oil drain from the sump and
attracts ferrous metal particles.
CONTROL The Electronic Control Box (ECB) only controls the de-oiling
valve in the oil system. The de-oiling solenoid valve is electrically
opened during APU start to make sure of cold start conditions and to
decrease the load on the pressure pump. The solenoid valve is open
during start-up to 60% RPM when: - the oil sump temperature is below
-6.7°C (+20°F),
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
OIL HEATER (OPTION) The control of the oil heater is independent of the
ECB. When the oil temperature is below 16 °C (61 °F) and the APU master
switch is released out, the heater is supplied with 115VAC. The oil
heater is switched off when the oil temperature increases above 49°C
(120 °F) or the master switch is selected ON. The oil heater is an
option.

APU AIR SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) load
compressor supplies the APU bleed air. The quantity changes with the
different bleed air demands of the pneumatic system. This system
includes: - bleed supply, - bleed control, - surge protection, - oil
cooling, - compartment cooling, - oil vent, - control, - monitoring.
BLEED SUPPLY Bleed air supply to the A/C pneumatic system is controlled
by a load control valve. The pneumatically-actuated CLOSE/OPEN butterfly
valve, which allows or stops the bleed airflow from the APU to the A/C
users, is controlled by the Electronic Control Box (ECB) and opens when
the APU BLEED P/BSW is set to the ON position. The "APU BLEED" P/B sends
"ON" signal to the ECB via the Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC).
BLEED CONTROL The quantity of air necessary to the aircraft bleed users
is controlled by the opening angle of the load compressor Inlet Guide
Vanes (IGVs). The IGVs are moved by a fuel-powered actuator
(IGC-Actuator). Pressurized fuel is supplied by the internal pressure
regulator part of the APU Fuel Control Unit.
SURGE PROTECTION
is hydraulically operated for accurate and fast operation. The hydraulic
fluid is high pressure fuel from the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) with
approximately 250 psig.
OIL COOLING A gearbox-driven fan draws air from the inlet plenum and
forces it to pass through the oil cooler. After leaving the oil cooler,
the air is discharged overboard.
COMPARTMENT COOLING Air supplied by the fan, driven by one of the gears
of the gearbox, is also used for APU compartment cooling. Cooling air
flows through the outlets located on the cooling fan outlet duct.
Natural convection ventilates the APU compartment through a vent grill
in the upper left area of the compartment when the APU is not in
operation.
OIL VENT The gearbox is vented to the APU exhaust. The air is bled after
an air/oil separator action.
CONTROL The ECB controls the air system using several parameters from
the following components installed on the APU: - APU inlet pressure (P2)
and temperature (T2) sensors, - load compressor discharge pressure
sensor (PT) and differential pressure sensor (DP), - command and
feedback signals from the actuators and the valves (IGV actuator, Load
Control Valve and Surge Control Valve), - A/C demands: Main Engine Start
(MES) and Environmental Control System (ECS).
Load compressor surge protection is ensured by a surge control valve,
which discharges the excess of air in the exhaust. The surge control
valve

into the Load Compressor Housing. To make sure the necessary bleed air
mass flows from the APU to the ECS, the ECB commands the SCV to the
fully closed position.

the ECB receives the closed signal from the load control valve. If the
load control valve was not in the open position, the APU shuts down
immediately. During every normal shutdown the ECB tests its overspeed
protection circuit by simulating an overspeed condition, which causes
the 3-way shut-off solenoid in the Fuel Control Unit to close, and
thereby starts the APU roll-down. It is possible to command an APU
re-start during the shutdown sequence. APU speed must be below 7% before
the starter motor is re-engaged.

ECB INTERFACES (3) POWER SUPPLY
LGCIU 1
One of the A/C batteries at the minimum and the A/C DC network,
electrically supply the Electronic Control Box (ECB), through the MAIN
control relay of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).
The ECB receives the aircraft on ground discrete input signal from
Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1.
MASTER SWITCH P/B The APU MASTER SWITCH sends a discrete supply or stop
signal to the ECB. The ECB sends a discrete signal to the FAULT light,
when an automatic shutdown occurs or if there is an emergency shutdown.
APU FUEL FEED SYSTEM The ECB receives a discrete signal from the APU low
fuel pressure switch. It sends a discrete signal to the APU fuel LP
shut-off valve.
EIU
The ECB receives an air intake flap open or closed position signal and
sends a power output to open or close the air intake flap.
During engine starts, the ECB receives a Main Engine Start (MES) signal
from Engine Interface Unit (EIU) 1 or 2. This signal causes the ECB to
set the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) to the fully open position if APU bleed
has been selected to ON.
START P/B
BMC
A discrete input signal from the START P/B starts the starting
sequences. The ECB sends a discrete signal to the ON light during the
APU start sequence. A discrete output signal to the A/C energizes the
AVAIL light in the START P/B when the APU speed is above 95%.
When the APU BLEED P/B is set to ON, Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC) 1
or 2 sends a discrete input to the ECB. This controls the APU load
control valve to open. The BMCs receive a closed-position signal from
the APU load control valve to monitor the pneumatic system and to show
ECAM indications.
AIR INTAKE FLAP
BACK-UP AND MAIN START CONTACTORS The ECB receives a discrete input from
the main start contactor and sends discrete outputs to the back-up and
main start contactors.
EMERGENCY STOP A discrete input signal from the A/C starts the APU
emergency shutdown logic after the ECB receives this signal.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)

APU BASIC DESCRIPTION (3) ENGINE CONTROLS
OIL SYSTEM
The Electronic Control Box (ECB) controls and monitors the APU
operation. It is a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) type
computer. The ECB has the following functions: - control of the APU
start sequence, - monitoring of the APU speed, exhaust gas temperature
and bleed air supply, - normal stop sequence and automatic or emergency
shutdown, - failure indication for trouble shooting.
A wet sump lubrication system cools and lubricates the electrical
generator, the accessory gearbox and the APU bearings. The system
components are all located on the gearbox except the oil cooler that is
located on the APU left hand side.
ENGINE The APU is a single spool engine based on a modular design
including a power section, driving a single stage centrifugal load
compressor and an accessory gearbox. The APU power section has: - a
single stage centrifugal compressor, - a reverse flow combustion
chamber, - a two-stage axial flow turbine.
IGV The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) control the amount of air discharged
from the APU load compressor. The 24 IGVs are moved simultaneously by a
gear train operated by an actuator. The IGV system uses fuel as
hydraulic fluid for the servo valve actuator to control the IGVs through
the ECB.
BLEED AND SURGE AIR The bleed and surge air system supplies air to the
A/C pneumatic system while avoiding load compressor surge. The bleed
control valve acts as a combined bleed and surge valve, electrically
controlled by the ECB and fuel operated.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
IGNITION AND STARTING SYSTEM The ignition and starting system rotates
the engine to a self-sustained speed. It also will start ignition of the
fuel/air mixture in the engine combustion chamber. The system
includes: - an electrical starter motor, - an ignition unit, - two
igniter plugs.
ACCESSORY GEARBOX The gearbox transmits the shaft power to the APU
accessories and to the APU generator, which are installed on the gearbox
pads. The gearbox is also the oil reservoir for the APU lubrication
system. The components mounted on the accessory gearbox are: - the
starter motor assembly, - the cooling air fan assembly with the
Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), - the Fuel Control Unit (FCU), - the
AC generator.
AC GENERATOR The 3 phases AC generator transforms the mechanical power
into electrical power of 90 KVA to supply the electrical A/C system with
115V-400Hz.

APU IGNITION &amp; STARTING D/O (3) STARTER CONTROL The starting system
operates the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) rotor through a clutch and
gearbox. When the APU speed is 55% rpm, the start logic of the
Electronic Control Box (ECB) stops the supply to the start contactors,
which stops the starter motor. The timed acceleration loop of the ECB
causes the APU to increase its speed until it gets to the governed
speed. During Ram Air Turbine (RAT) extension, APU starting is inhibited
by the Battery Charge Limiters (BCL 1 and BCL 2). The BCLs remove the
ground signal necessary to the operation of the Main Start Contactor
from the MASTER SW, and thus prevent operation of the main start
contactor 5 KA.
IGNITION CONTROL The ignition system is used to ignite and maintain
combustion during the start phase. The ignition system includes: - an
ignition unit, - two ignition leads, - two igniter plugs. The ignition
system operates from initial crank up to 55% rpm.

operate the Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) actuator and the bleed control valve
actuator.
FCU The Fuel Control Unit (FCU) has five functions: - fuel filtering, -
pressure increase, - fuel metering, - positive fuel shut-off, - fuel
muscle pressure regulation. The FCU is composed of a Low Pressure (LP)
fuel pump, a filter with a filter by-pass valve and a Differential
Pressure Indicator (DPI), a High Pressure (HP) fuel pump with a pressure
relief valve, a constant Differential Pressure (DELTA P) valve, a
pressure regulator for the bleed control valve and the IGV actuators, a
fuel servovalve, and the 3-way solenoid valve. A FCU drain line purges
the pump shaft seal.

APU FUEL SYSTEM D/O (3) APU START FUEL PRESSURE As the Auxiliary Power
Unit (APU) is started the fuel coming from the aircraft fuel system
flows through the Low Pressure (LP) pump, through a filter to the High
Pressure (HP) pump. If the filter becomes contaminated, the impending
filter bypass will be indicated by the Differential Pressure Indicator
(DPI). When the filter is blocked the by-pass valve will open. The HP
pump has a pressure relief valve to cut off excessive pressure peaks.

APU FUEL SYSTEM D/O (3) APU START (continued) ECB FUNCTIONS During the
APU start, the Electronic Control Box (ECB) energizes the 3-way solenoid
valve and the Torque Motor (TM) of the fuel servo valve. The fuel,
pressurized by the HP pump, then flows through the servo valve and
through the 3-way solenoid valve to the flow divider. The ECB schedules
fuel flow for start sequence, on speed operation and shutdown sequence.
The ECB modulates the on-speed fuel schedule to match the A/C demand for
bleed air and electrical load.

APU FUEL SYSTEM D/O (3) APU START (continued) FLOW DIVIDER The flow
divider and drain valve assembly divides the fuel between the pilot and
main injectors. During the start sequence, the pilot injector valve
opens when the fuel pressure reaches 20 psi to initially supply the 3
pilot fuel injectors. As the fuel pressure increases, the main injector
valve opens and fuel is supplied to the 6 main fuel injectors. When the
APU is running, the two valves are in the open position to supply all
injectors. The ECB controls the fuel system using several parameters.
During the start sequence, it uses APU speed, Exhaust Gas Temperature
(EGT), air inlet pressure and temperature. During steady-state operation
the ECB uses the speed only.

APU OIL SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL STORAGE The sump of the Auxiliary Power
Unit (APU) accessory gearbox is the oil reservoir. The accessory gearbox
sump contains 5.2 l (1.4 US gal) of oil. On the left hand side of the
gearbox, a gravity fill port is installed with a scupper to drain
spilled oil. The gearbox has: - a pressure fill port, - an overflow
port, - a sight glass.
PROTECTION The ECB protects the APU in case of oil system malfunction.
The ECB monitors oil pressure and oil temperature. If one of the oil
parameters is out of range, the ECB initiates an automatic APU shutdown
without time delay. - gearbox High Oil Temperature (HOT) threshold:
135°C (275°F), - AC generator high oil temp: 180°C (356°F), - Low Oil
Pressure (LOP): 35 psi.
MONITORING The oil system is monitored to increase the APU life. Lube
and scavenge filters have visual clogging indicators. The oil sump has a
low level sensor to show maintenance information in the cockpit. When
the level is at the "ADD" mark 4l (1 US gal) the APU is able to continue
running for at least 60 hours. A magnetic drain plug, immersed in the
APU oil, is used for the oil drainage from the sump and attracts ferrous
metal particles. Two Differential Pressure (DELTA P) switches, one for
the scavenge filter and a second one for the pressure filter are use for
the ECB in case of clogging situation and an APU auto shutdown is
triggered.

APU AIR SYSTEM D/O (3) PRESSURIZATION AND OIL VENT
APU RUNNING AT 100% - BLEED NOT SELECTED Bleed air supply to the A/C
pneumatic system is controlled by a bleed control valve for delivery
function. The fuel-operated bleed control valve is a diverter valve:
either to the A/C system and/or the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) exhaust.
Pressurized air enters the gearbox during operation from the front and
rear bearing seal buffering systems. This air comes from the power
section compressor. The gearbox is vented to the APU exhaust. The oil
mist is separated from the vent air by an air-oil separator.
CONTROL NOTE: the hydraulic fluid is high pressure fuel from the Fuel
Control Unit pressure regulator part with a pressure of approximately
250 psig.
BLEED CONTROL The quantity of air necessary for the aircraft bleed users
is controlled by the opening angles of the load compressor Inlet Guide
Vanes (IGVs). The IGVs are moved by a fuel-powered actuator.
SURGE PROTECTION Load compressor surge protection is done by the bleed
control valve that discharges the excess of air in the exhaust.
OIL COOLING A gearbox-driven fan draws air from the inlet plenum and
forces it to go through the oil cooler. After leaving the oil cooler,
the air is discharged overboard. The cooling fan incorporates a
Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), which supplies a direct current to the
Electronic Control Box (ECB), if the main supply is interrupted, for a
maximum of 230ms.
The ECB controls the air system using several parameters: - signals from
the APU inlet pressure and temperature sensor, - signals from the load
compressor discharge pressure sensor and the differential pressure
sensor, - command and feedback signals from the fuel driven actuators.
MONITORING The compressor discharge pressure sensor is a unit, which
contains a static pressure and a differential pressure sensor. It is
located at the APU air intake plenum. The ECB uses the sensor output
voltage for the calculation of the compressor air flow and to give the
APU BLEED pressure indication for the APU page on the lower ECAM display
unit. To help maintenance and troubleshooting, the bleed control valve
has a visual position indicator.
COMPARTMENT COOLING Air supplied by the fan, which is driven by one of
the gears of the gearbox, is also used for the APU compartment cooling.
The compartment cooling air is blown through a smaller duct attached to
the fan discharge tube. Natural convection ventilates the APU
compartment when the APU is not in operation.

APU SYSTEM MANAGEMENT D/O (3) STEADY STATE In steady state the ECB
controls the speed, the load compressor operation, and monitors the
Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT).
SPEED CONTROL This function keeps the rotation speed of the APU rotating
assembly constant, whatever the load applied. This is achieved by
metering the fuel flow, which varies with the air inlet pressure and
temperature.
LOAD COMPRESSOR CONTROL This function opens the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs)
according to the bleed air demand from the A/C, ECS or MES. Protection
against load compressor surge is achieved by controlling and reading the
position of the bleed control valve, according to the inlet temperature,
and differential and discharge pressure signals of the load compressor
(DELTA P/P ratio). If the ECB detects a surge condition, the bleed
control valve is positioned to discharge air to the exhaust. NOTE: 1: In
case of failure of the load compressor control, the IGVs are closed and
the bleed control valve is fully opened to discharge. 2: In case of
detected reverse flow operation, the APU is automatically shut down by
the ECB.
EGT CONTROL This function avoids APU over temperature by controlling the
Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) position to closed. Thus, the pneumatic load is
first reduced to give priority to the electrical load. This is achieved
by controlling the position of the IGVs to the closed position as a
function of the EGT as long as the over temperature condition is
present. NOTE: In case of IGV control failure, the IGVs are closed.

OFF, the pneumatic load is removed, i.e. the IGVs are closed, the bleed
control valve positioned to discharge, the AC generator may still be
loaded, then the engine goes into a 120 s cool down cycles. This
function runs the APU at a low stabilized temperature before normal
shutdown.
NORMAL SHUTDOWN An APU normal shutdown is initiated when the MASTER SW
P/B is released out. If the APU bleed air is not selected, the APU shuts
down immediately. The normal shutdown signal stops the fuel supply. This
causes the APU to decelerate. The AVAIL indication goes off and the AC
generator de-energizes. When the speed is less than 90% rpm, the gearbox
de-oil solenoid valve opens. When the speed is less than 7% rpm, the air
intake flap is controlled to fully close and the de-oiling solenoid
valve is de-energized to close.

ECB INTERFACES (3) POWER SUPPLY
LGCIU 1
The Electronic Control Box (ECB) is electrically supplied, through the
Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) MAIN control relay, by at least one of the
A/C batteries, the A/C DC network or transiently from the 28 V DC
Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG).
The ECB receives the flight/ground discrete input signal from the
Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1.
MASTER SWITCH P/B
The ECB receives a discrete signal from the APU low fuel pressure
switch. It sends a discrete signal to the APU fuel LP Shut-Off Valve
(SOV).
The APU MASTER SWitch sends a discrete supply or stop signal to the ECB.
The ECB sends a discrete signal to the FAULT light when an automatic or
emergency shutdown occurs or a power-up test fails.
APU FUEL FEED SYSTEM
EIU
The ECB sends a power output for opening or closing the air intake flap
and receives an air intake flap open or closed position signal.
During engine starts, the ECB receives a Main Engine Start (MES) signal
from Engine Interface Units (EIUs) 1 or 2. This signal causes the ECB to
position the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) to the fully open position and the
bleed control valve to modulate in delivery position.
START P/B
BMC
A discrete input signal from the START P/B initiates the starting
sequences. The ECB sends a discrete signal to the ON light during the
APU start sequence. A discrete output signal to the A/C energizes the
AVAIL light in the START P/B when the APU speed is above 95% rpm.
When the APU bleed P/B is set to ON, Bleed Monitoring Computers (BMCs) 1
or 2 send a discrete input to the ECB which controls the opening of the
APU bleed control valve. ECB sends discrete output signal to the BMCs to
indicate when the BCV is not in the closed position.
BACK-UP AND MAIN START CONTACTORS
TSO/JAR
The ECB sends discrete output signals to the back-up and the main start
contactors and receives as a feedback a discrete input from the main
start contactor.
The ECB receives a discrete input from the A/C signature PIN
programming. This open or ground signal determines whether the ECB
follows the Technical Standard Order (TSO) or the Joint Aviation
Requirements (JAR).
AIR INTAKE FLAP
EMERGENCY STOP A discrete input signal from the A/C initiates the APU
emergency shutdown logic after the ECB has received this signal.

position according to the demand. The ECB sends a discrete output to the
ACSC 1 and 2 to signal that the APU bleed valve is in delivery position.
A320/A321 IDENTIFICATION The ECB receives a discrete input from the A/C
signature PIN programming. This identification PIN lets the ECB identify
the A321 applications for functional differences from those of an A320.
GENERATOR OIL TEMPERATURE SENSOR The ECB receives an analog input from
this sensor which is a component mounted on the AC generator.
SDAC The ECB sends to the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs)
1 and 2, via ARINC 429 data buses, the indications to show on the ECAM
APU page and shutdown information to trigger the related warnings.
CFDS The ECB is a BITE type 1 computer and is connected to the
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) via ARINC 429 data buses.

APU SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) Close and lock the oil filler cap.
SERVICING APU OIL SERVICING APU oil servicing is accomplished on an
"as-needed" basis or after scheduled oil quantity checks. The oil
indicating system shows if the oil quantity is sufficient or if an oil
servicing is necessary. The oil level information is displayed on the
EIS and the Multipurpose Control &amp; Display Units (MCDUs) in the cockpit
on: - the APU page on the lower ECAM display unit (LOW OIL LEVEL
advisory), - the APU SERVICE DATA page on the MCDU, indicating APU OIL
Level O.K. or LOW. NOTE: Note: The advisory appears on the ECAM APU page
when the oil level has reached the ADD mark on the APU oil tank. Airbus
recommends servicing the APU oil at the next daily maintenance when the
LOW OIL LEVEL message comes on. With no oil leakage, sufficient oil is
available to allow a further 10 hours of APU operation. Prior to
servicing, shut down the APU and open the APU cowl doors. Make sure to
use the operator approved oil for servicing (operators may select from
the approved list). The oil may be serviced by the gravity (most common)
or pressure fill procedure (optional). Gravity procedure: - Open the
lock and slowly loosen the oil filler cap to release remaining pressure
from the oil reservoir, - Check sight glass for level, - Slowly add oil
until the level is at the FULL mark on the sight glass. Pressure fill
procedure: - Check sight glass for level, - Connect pressure and
overfill lines to APU gearbox, - Slowly pump oil into the gearbox until
the level is at the FULL mark on the sight glass.

APU SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MEL/DEACTIVATION In case of an APU inlet
actuator failure, the APU may be dispatched per MEL with the inlet OPEN
or CLOSED. The APU will only be operational with the inlet deactivated
OPEN (for a maximum of 10 days). The air inlet actuator is equipped with
a manual drive. In case of failure the manual drive may be used to move
the inlet to the required position prior to deactivation. There are 2
different actuators that may be installed. One requires 47 turns of the
manual drive for one full travel of the inlet. The other requires 87
turns. Access to the actuator is through an access door near the APU
inlet on the right hand side of the fuselage. Deactivation procedure: -
get access to the actuator, - disconnect the actuator electrical
connector from the fixed connector on the frame and install a blanking
cap, - use the manual drive to move the inlet to the required position.
Use a torque wrench to avoid damaging the actuator. If the inlet is
deactivated CLOSED, no further action is needed other than to placard
the APU inoperative. If the inlet is deactivated OPEN, the following
procedure has to be accomplished. When the inlet is in the OPEN
position, a jumper lead needs to be installed to close the circuit and
allow the APU to start. Make a dummy connector and paint it red for easy
identification.

be purged of air after maintenance. The drain valve is located in the
APU compartment in the fuel supply line to the fuel control. A switch
labeled FUEL VENT PUSH is installed on the APU compartment forward
firewall to allow maintenance to operate the APU fuel pump and purge the
fuel line from the APU compartment. This switch allows the APU pump to
operate and the APU Low Pressure fuel valve to open without the APU
Master Switch ON. A drain valve adapter tool is connected to the drain
valve. On the front firewall of the APU compartment: - Push and hold the
FUEL VENT pushbutton switch. At the APU fuel vent and drain valve, a
continuous flow of fuel indicates that the APU fuel pump is operating
and the line is purged, - Release the FUEL VENT pushbutton switch. The
flow of fuel stops when the APU fuel pump stops running, - Disconnect
the adapter tool.
