OXYGEN SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The oxygen system
includes: - the crew system, - the passenger system, - the portable
system. Crew Oxygen System: The flight crew oxygen system supplies
oxygen to the flight crew. It is used if there is a loss of cabin
pressurization or smoke or dangerous gases in the cockpit. The oxygen is
supplied by a high-pressure oxygen cylinder to quick-donning masks in
the cockpit. Passenger Oxygen System: The passenger and cabin attendant
oxygen system is supplied by chemical oxygen generator units that are in
the cabin, the cabin attendant stations, the lavatories and the galleys.
There are two types of chemical generators that supply oxygen for 15
minutes or 22 minutes. Portable Oxygen System: The portable oxygen
system supplies oxygen to the passengers, the cabin attendants and the
flight crew if an emergency occurs and for first aid treatment. The
Portable Breathing Equipment (PBE) supplies breathing means and eye
protection to the flight crew members and the cabin attendants. It lets
them move freely to extinguish a fire. The high-pressure portable
cylinder includes continuous-flow type masks and supplies first aid
oxygen to the passengers.

OXYGEN SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) FLIGHT
CREW OXYGEN SYSTEM The flight crew oxygen is supplied from a
high-pressure oxygen cylinder at a pressure of 127.5 bar (1.850 psig).
This cylinder can be isolated for maintenance by a manual ON/OFF valve.
A direct-reading pressure gage gives an indication of the cylinder
pressure, independently of the open or closed position of the manual
valve. The cylinder is installed in a cradle with two quick-release
clamps in the L/H avionics compartment. A pressure regulator transmitter
assembly is directly connected to the cylinder. It includes a
high-pressure stage with an integrated pressure transducer for ECAM
indication and a low-pressure stage. The pressure regulator regulates
the low pressure at 4.48 to 6.48 bar (65 to 94 psig). A supply valve
opens or closes the crew oxygen supply. The CREW SUPPLY P/B on the
oxygen panel controls the supply valve. High-pressure and low-pressure
protection is done by safety devices that include a high-pressure safety
outlet and a low-pressure safety outlet. The high-pressure safety outlet
is a frangible disk type. The low-pressure safety outlet is a pressure
relief valve. Rupture of the frangible disk is set at a cylinder
pressure of 2500 to 2775 psig. The pressure relief valve sets the limit
of the low-pressure oxygen supply to 175 psig. An overboard green
discharge indicator is connected to the high-pressure safety outlet and
to the low-pressure safety outlet. If there is overpressure, the green
disk blows out and a yellow indicator comes into view to show that the
cylinder was discharged or the pressure relief valve is open.

A pressure switch and a test port are connected to the distribution
manifold. The pressure switch operates when the oxygen supply pressure
decreases to 3.45 plus or minus 0.35 bar (50 plus or minus 5 psig) and
transmits a warning signal REGUL LO PR to the ECAM/DOOR/OXY page. The
optional filling connector makes it possible to fill the oxygen cylinder

when the oxygen pressure is less than 1000 psig. If the oxygen pressure
decreases to less than the minimum operating pressure of 3.45 plus or
minus 0.35 bar (50 plus or minus 5 psig), the indication REGUL LO PR is
shown in amber on the DOOR/OXY page. The mask assembly and the stowage
box are installed adjacent to each crew member seat. The stowage box
contains the mask. When the mask is pulled out of the box, a supply
valve installed in the stowage box opens and lets oxygen flow to the
mask.

To use the mask, squeeze the red clips. This will inflate the mask
harness. Bring the mask in position and release the red clips. When the
red clips are released, the oxygen flow to the harness stops and the
oxygen that remains in the harness is released into the atmosphere. The
mask is then ready to be used.

OXYGEN SAFETY IN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE ENVIRONMENT (2) OXYGEN PROPERTIES
The air is made of 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and 1% other gases. The
gaseous oxygen is colorless, odorless and tasteless. The gaseous oxygen
is not flammable, but supports combustion. The gaseous oxygen is heavier
than air and can accumulate in low lying areas. The oxygen reacts to
most metals and organic material. The reactivity varies with the type of
material: - The reaction can be slow and can cause for example steel
oxidation commonly called rust, - The reaction can be fast when the
oxygen is in contact with petroleum product, and can cause fire or
explosion.

(continued) OXYGEN ENRICHED ATMOSPHERE An atmosphere is considered as an
oxygen-enriched atmosphere when the oxygen percentage is 24% and above.
In comparison to a fire in the air, a fire in an oxygen-enriched
atmosphere will be characterized by: - High in intensity, - Higher in
temperature and, - Higher in thermal power. Pure oxygen at high pressure
will react violently with materials such as oil, grease, textiles and
rubber, and will get powerfully in fire. In most cases, a fire that
occurs in an atmosphere full of oxygen cannot be extinguished as long as
the cause of fire has not been isolated.
FIRST AID Persons getting on fire in an atmosphere full of oxygen cannot
get help directly by a person entering the area. The rescuer takes also
the risk to get on fire. The victim must be sprayed of water and carried
outside in free air as soon as possible. The first aid care must be
applied immediately and if possible in a specialized care unit for badly
burned person.

(continued) DANGERS LINKED TO PRESSURIZED GAS The oxygen is stowed in
cylinders at very high-pressure: 1850psi at 21°C, 130kg/cm2. Such a high
pressure is potentially dangerous. Any crack in the pressure wall of
pressurized gas system causes a violent eruption of gas through the
crack. The result can be a high or even violent explosion. For example,
if a valve brakes off a high-pressure cylinder, the container becomes an
unguided missile. That is the reason why the oxygen cylinders and
pressure reducers must be tested at regular intervals (hydrostatic test
every 3 - 5 years depending on applicable standard / special permit).

switches during the oxygen filling procedure. Electrostatically ground
the aircraft and also electrostatically bond the oxygen charging
equipment to the aircraft. If a thunderstorm can occur, immediately stop
all oxygen filling operations. Stop the filling procedure immediately if
the pressures in each oxygen cylinder do not increase smoothly and at
the same time. Only use aviator's breathing oxygen as defined by Airbus.
Keep all hydrocarbons (fuels, corrosion protection compounds,
lubricants, etc.) away from all sources of oxygen. Oxygen becomes
explosive when it touches hydrocarbons. Open the hand-valves of the
oxygen cylinder very slowly and turn them to the fully open position. In
the case the hand-valves are not fully open before flight, the data of

(continued) OXYGEN COMPONENTS REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION Make sure that
the ground support equipment is approved for the oxygen system.
Equipment that is not approved can cause contamination of the system and
injury. Always work with clean clothes and tools. Keep your hands clean
(possibly, wear gloves in cotton). Do not touch connection ends and
interior of oxygen components with bare hands, because skin oil and
bacteria are a source of contamination. The area around the oxygen
components must always be cleaned with approved cleaner before and after
any work done on the system. Any tool, rag, cloth, or equipment that is
not clean and free of oil traces must not be used or stay in the area
around the oxygen components. Make sure that all oxygen cylinder valves
are closed. Due to possible residual pressure in the line, disconnect
the connectors carefully. Put dry, clean, metal or plastic plugs on all
pipes or units removed temporarily. Put each pipe or unit in a sealed
vinyl bag. Unwanted material in the oxygen system could damage the
system or cause explosion if oil ingress.
Make sure that the flexible hoses are not twisted or pulled tight. If
the hoses are twisted or pulled tight the connections will break and
cause a leak. Torque the connection at the right value given by the
maintenance manual. Open and close the spring-loaded clamps carefully to
prevent damage to the electrical harness near the oxygen cylinders.
WARNING: NEVER USE STANDARD OIL TO LUBRICATE THE CONNECTOR THREAD (risk
of explosion). ONLY LUBRICANTS and thread compounds SPECIFICALLY
APPROVED FOR OXYGEN must be used. Some unit/assembly are heavy. Support
the unit/assembly carefully to prevent injury to persons and damage.
During disconnection/reconnection of an oxygen line connector use two
wrenches: one for the nut and one for the counter nut to avoid force
onto the material (risk of rupture and leakage).

assembly and the stowage box are installed adjacent to each crewmember
seat. The stowage box which contains the mask, also controls the flow of
oxygen when the mask is pulled out of the box. To use the mask, squeeze
the red clips, which will inflate the mask harness; releasing the red
clips will stop oxygen flow to the harness and vent the oxygen remaining
in the harness to the atmosphere. Oxygen flow is indicated by the
blinker showing yellow and an OXY ON flag, which appears on the left
door when closed. The mask regulator provides either normal or pure
oxygen by means of a Normal/100% selector. In the Normal position, the
user breathes a mixture of cabin air and oxygen. When the selector is in
the 100% position, the user will breathe pure oxygen. When the emergency
rotation knob is rotated, the mask regulator supplies 100% of oxygen at
a permanent positive pressure, independent of the position of the
normal/100% selector. To take the mask off, the harness has to be
inflated. This is done by operating the red clips.

PASSENGER OXYGEN UNIT D/O (3) MASK OPERATION As soon as the emergency
oxygen container doors open, the masks fall out. They are hung on
lanyards within the reach of users. When the first user pulls the mask
towards his face, the release pin starts the chemical generation. Oxygen
flows through the flexible supply hoses to all masks of the container.
Each flow indicator shows a green stripe.
CHEMICAL OXYGEN GENERATION The chemical generator uses the basic
principal of thermal decomposition of sodium chlorate. A thermal
indicator shows the generator condition. According to the generator
type, there can be two different indicators: 1- Black: the oxygen
generator has been burned out. - Yellow: the oxygen generator is new. 2-
Blue: the oxygen generator has been burned out. - Pink: the oxygen
generator is new. The chlorate core is fitted in a stainless steel
housing.
GENERATOR OPERATION By pulling the release pin of the starter assembly
the spring loaded firing pin will hit the percussion cap. The heat
produced in the percussion cap will then activate the starting powder of
the generator.

PASSENGER GASEOUS OXYGEN SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) GENERAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The passenger gaseous oxygen system supplies oxygen to each oxygen
container in case of an emergency. The rate of the oxygen flow depends
on the altitude. The oxygen supply starts automatically at a cabin
pressure equivalent to an altitude exceeding 14.000 ft (4.265 m) and
stops when the cabin pressure drops below a pressure equivalent to
10.000 ft (3.050 m). The system can than be re-started if the aircraft
has to climb to clear another obstacle. The gaseous oxygen system has no
characteristic flight profile. Since the flow is greater with the
altitude, the lower the flight is done the longer the oxygen supply
lasts. High-pressure oxygen is stored in oxygen cylinder assemblies
installed behind sidewall linings RH in the bulk cargo compartment. The
standard system has 6 oxygen cylinders. Up to 8 oxygen cylinders can be
installed on airline request. When the system is operated, low-pressure
oxygen from the pressure regulators is supplied to the two Main
Distribution Lines (MDLs). One line is installed below the cabin floor
along the LH side of the aircraft. The other line is installed above the
cabin ceiling. Riser Lines (RLs) are connected to the MDLs to supply
oxygen to the hat rack lines. The hat rack lines supply oxygen to the
oxygen containers.

PASSENGER GASEOUS OXYGEN SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) THERMAL COMPENSATORS
PASSENGER OXYGEN SYSTEM STORAGE OXYGEN CYLINDER ASSEMBLY The
high-pressure oxygen cylinder is made of carbon fibres wrapped around an
aluminium inner liner. It has the capacity of 3310 liter (116.9 cuft) at
a pressure of 127.5 bar (1850 psig). The cylinder head valve assembly is
made of: - a slow-opening Shutoff Valve (SOV) with an integrated reed
switch sensor for closed/open identification, - a direct-reading
pressure gage, - a high-pressure safety outlet with a burst disc, - an
inlet/outlet port. To protect the cylinder from overpressure, the oxygen
cylinder has a high-pressure safety outlet with a burst disc. The burst
disc will rupture at a pressure of 169 bar (2451 psig) at a temperature
of 71 °C (160 °F) and 191 bar (2770 psig) at a temperature of 21 °C
(70°F).
OVERBOARD DISCHARGE INDICATOR The overboard discharge indicator makes a
continuous surface with the outside skin of the aircraft. It has a
fluorescent green burst disk and a yellow housing. The burst disk of
each oxygen cylinder and the safety outlet of the pressure relief valve
are connected via the overboard discharge line with the overboard
discharge indicator. In case of overpressure in the higher part or in
the intermediate pressure part, the green burst disk is blown out and a
reflective yellow area of the discharge indicator is shown.
OXYGEN PRESSURE REDUCER The oxygen pressure reducer transmitter assembly
is directly connected to the inlet/outlet port of the oxygen cylinder
assembly and reduces the cylinder pressure to the intermediate pressure
of 7.6 ± 0.7 bar (110 ± 10 psig). The outlet of the oxygen pressure
reducer is connected with the intermediate pressure line.

CATTS LTD
The thermal compensators prevent dangerous increases of temperature
during replenishment of oxygen cylinder. They are installed in the
high-pressure line (fill line) immediately in front of the pressure
reducers.
TEMPERATURE TRANSDUCER The temperature transducer measures the ambient
temperature in the installation area of oxygen cylinders and generates a
related electrical signal sent to the Quantity Calculation and Control
Unit (QCCU) for the computation.
PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE A pressure relief valve is installed between the
intermediate pressure line and the overboard discharge line. It is a
double redundant safety valve. The inlet port of the pressure relief
valve is connected with the intermediate pressure line. If the pressure
in the intermediate pressure line exceeds 9.7 ± 0.7 bar (140 ± 10 psig),
the valves will open. The overpressure can then discharge via the
overboard discharge line. The relief valve closes when the pressure
decreases below 8.3 bar (120 psig). For redundancy functions, two valves
are arranged in series to prevent system pressure loss if one valve
fails to close. Two serial valve devices are arranged in parallel.
OXYGEN FILLING PORT The oxygen filling port enables the connection of an
oxygen ground filling equipment for cylinders replenishing. The oxygen
filling port has: - a flow restrictor to make sure safe pressure
rises, - a filter to prevent contamination of the system, - an external
cap with a safety chain.

DISTRIBUTION GENERAL The oxygen distribution lines enable the supply of
the oxygen from the oxygen cylinders in the bulk cargo compartment to
the cabin. The low-pressure oxygen is supplied to the two MDLs. At the
FR47/51, the MDL is split in two: One line is installed below the cabin
floor along the LH side of the aircraft and the other line is installed
above the cabin ceiling. The two MDL are joined again at FR 26. The area
where the MDLs are doubled is the engine burst area. Riser lines are
connected to the MDL's at approximately every 4 fuselage frames to
supply oxygen to the hatrack supply lines and to the oxygen containers.

DISTRIBUTION (continued) INTERMEDIATE LINE LOW PRESSURE SWITCH The
low-pressure switch is installed in the intermediate pressure line
between the pressure reducers and the oxygen regulators. If the pressure
in the intermediate pressure line is not sufficient, the low-pressure
switch generates a warning signal on the Passenger Oxygen Indication
Panel (POXIP) in the cockpit overhead panel. The decreasing pressure is
6.9 bar (100 psi) and the increasing pressure is 5.5 ± 0.7 bar (80±10
psi).
The cap of the test port installed in the oxygen distribution system
downstream of the oxygen regulators has a bleed/vent function. Together
with the bleed/vent valve it allows a sufficient equalization of
pressure between the oxygen distribution system and the cabin pressure.
This prevents the 'SYS ON' indicator light to come on accidentally when
the cabin altitude pressure changes.
PRESSURE OXYGEN REGULATORS Two redundant Pressure Oxygen Regulators
(PORs) are installed in the intermediate pressure line. Each regulator
operates the system independently from the other. The POR integrates a
motor driven SOV. At first the POR integrated motor driven SOV is fully
opened for approximately 6-9 seconds to surge the MDL. After the
surging, the POR measures the ambient pressure (determining cabin
altitude) and the pressure in the MDL just downstream of the POR through
integrated pressure sensors. The POR compares the pressure in the MDL to
the required pressure (depending on cabin altitude) using analogue
circuits. The motor driven SOV moves to the position necessary to obtain
the correct pressure in the MDL thus supplying the correct flow to the
oxygen masks.
TEST PORTS The system has three test ports. One is installed in the
intermediate pressure line and the other two are installed in the
low-pressure distribution network. These test ports are used for the
connection of test tool for leakage, pressure tests, system function,
and pressure release of the distribution network.

DISTRIBUTION (continued) BLEED/VENT VALVE The bleed vent valve is
installed at the most FWD point of MDL located in the ceiling. After
system activation, the valve opens for approximately 15 to 25 seconds to
let the air/oxygen mixture contained in the distribution network be
released out of the MDLs and the system is purged. The bleed vent valve
contains an orifice, which lets a small amount of oxygen escape from the
distribution system. The bleed vent valve also contains a filter
protecting the oxygen system from contamination.
MDL SHUTOFF VALVES The system has two MDLs SOVs, which are pneumatically
controlled. One MDL SOV is installed in the ceiling MDL just AFT of the
rim release area. The other MDL SOV is installed in the under floor MDL
just AFT of the rim release area. During normal system operation both
MDL SOVs are open in flow direction. There are also RL SOVs installed in
the engine burst area and the rim release area. They are installed
immediately after the connection with the main supply line. In normal
operation, the riser line SOVs are open. If a riser line is damaged, the
riser line SOV closes automatically.
RL CHECK VALVES The system has two check valves installed. One check
valve is installed in the ceiling MDL just FWD of the engine burst area.
The other check valve is installed in the under floor MDL just FWD of
the engine burst area. In normal operation, the check valves are open.
When a main line is damaged due to uncontained engine rotor failure or
rim release, the check valve closes.

GENERAL Altitude Pressure Switch The altitude switch, which is installed
in the avionics compartment, starts the automatic operation of the
passenger oxygen system. It sends a signal to open the oxygen
regulators, which supply low-pressure oxygen to the oxygen distribution
system. In case of high altitude airfield operation option, the altitude
switch has two settings: - the first setting closes, if the pressure
falls to a value equivalent to 14000 +250/ -750 ft. (4267.12 +76,2/
-228,6 m), - the second setting closes, if the pressure falls to a value
equivalent to 16000 +250/ -750 ft. (4876.71 +76,2/ -228,6 m).
-   the electrical circuit is set to the normal condition,
-   the oxygen regulators close. In this case the ON light comes on and
    stays on for 5 seconds. It does not go off if the electrical circuit
    for the oxygen system does not reset to the correct condition.
NOTE: If high altitude airfield operation is required, the system can be
adapted by using a dual altitude pressure switch and by adapting the
activation circuit. Oxygen Control Panel On the oxygen control panel,
the MASK MAN ON P/BSW allows the crew to activate the oxygen system as a
backup and override the altitude pressure switch. The oxygen regulators
stay open even if the MASK MAN ON P/BSW is released. When the OPEN
relays do not operate, it is necessary to hold the MASK MAN ON P/BSW for
1 second to open the oxygen regulators. A safety guard is installed over
the MASK MAN ON P/BSW to prevent accidental operation of the system. The
SYS ON indicator light on the overhead panel comes on when at least one
pressure oxygen regulator is open. When the pressure in the system
decreases the SYS ON indicator light goes off. TMR RESET P/B The TMR
RESET P/BSW is installed on the maintenance panel and is used to reset
the controls after the system operation. When the TMR RESET P/BSW is

PASSENGER GASEOUS OXYGEN SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) SERVICING FILLING
Refilling of the cylinders is accomplished via the oxygen filling port.
This port is installed on the oxygen fill panel and enables connection
of an external oxygen source for replenishing of the oxygen cylinders.
The correct filling pressure depends on the outside and the cargo
compartment temperatures, and can be determined by the use of the
aircraft placards. To check the correct fill pressure, you have to
calculate the average pressure in the replenished oxygen cylinders. Make
sure that the pressure on the fill panel pressure indicator is the same
as the calculated average pressure in the oxygen cylinders. During
filling, an increase in temperature in each cylinder is limited by a
thermal compensator. The QCCU monitors the fill pressure in the
cylinders and the pressure indication is displayed on the POXIP and on
the indicator fill panel.
TEST PORT The three test ports enable the maintenance crew to increase
and decrease the pressure in the oxygen system during a functional check
of the system. The first test port, which is installed in the
intermediate line before the oxygen regulators, is used for different
tests and checks of the oxygen system. The second test port, which is
installed in the oxygen distribution system downstream of the oxygen
regulators, is used for different tests and checks of the oxygen
distribution system. The third test port, which is installed in the
oxygen distribution system downstream of the check valves, lets you
decrease the pressure of the supply lines downstream of the check
valves. Before the depressurization of the system, it is necessary to
close the manual SOVs of the oxygen cylinders.

CREW PORTABLE OXYGEN SYSTEM D/O (3) DESCRIPTION The container is
installed with a tamper seal and a serviceability indicator for the
preflight inspection; the serviceability indicator is broken after
opening the box. NOTE: According to the supplier, another indicator is
available which shows a yellow indicator if the container has not been
opened. The protective breathing hood works with a closed breathing
circuit. The system is activated by a starter via a lanyard. The expired
air will be regenerated, enriched with oxygen, and inhaled again. The
oxygen is generated in exothermic chemical reaction between the
potassium peroxide (KO2), the humidity, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) in
the expired air; this reaction releases heat. The protective breathing
equipment is composed of three main parts: A hood with: - the neck seal
at the level of the neck, - the straps attached to the hood maintain the
inner mask around the back of the user head, - a relief valve in the
hood, which keeps the overpressure in the hood at a comfortable level.
An inner mask installed with: - an anti-suffocation valve, operated by a
higher breathing resistance. The user can inhale through this valve from
the volume between head and hood, - a speech transmitter is located in
front of the oronasal mask. A KO2 cartridge has: - an attached breathing
bag installed with a volume-controlled relief valve, - a starter
activated by a lanyard, - a fold tube (or breathing hose) connected to
the oronasal mask, - a belt, which holds the cartridge on the hood.

OXYGEN SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) DAILY CHECK During the daily check
the external walk around will include the visual check of the crew
oxygen cylinder overpressure (Green) discharge disc to be sure that it
is not missing. The ECAM DOOR/OXY page shows the crew oxygen pressure
indication. If the pressure is less than 1500 PSI for a 77 cuft bottle,
an amber half frame (advisory) is shown for information. For a 115 cuft
bottle, the threshold is 1000 PSI. In this case, check the AMM. This is
to see if the minimum oxygen pressure available to the flight crew is
within the permitted limits. Refer to the minimum flight crew oxygen
pressure chart and find the minimum pressure according to the ambient
temperature and the number of crew members. If the pressure is less than
the minimum flight crew oxygen pressure the oxygen cylinder must be
changed. Push the reset test slider, the blinker turns yellow and goes
back to black again showing that the regulator is leak tight. Press the
harness inflation control, the blinker turns yellow and goes back to
black again showing that the harness is leak tight. Pressing the
emergency rotation knob tests the on demand system. The microphone is
tested by activating the loudspeakers, the interphone, and by pressing
the emergency rotation knob. When the tests are completed, make sure
that the NORMAL / 100% selector is locked in the 100% position, and the
reset slider returns to the UP position.
