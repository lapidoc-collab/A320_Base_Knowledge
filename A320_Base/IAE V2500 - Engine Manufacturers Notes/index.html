Introduction
IAE International Aero Engines AG (IAE)
•
Rolls Royce plc - High Pressure Compressor.
On March 11, 1983, five of the worlds leading aerospace manufacturers
signed a 30 year collaboration agreement to produce an engine for the
single isle aircraft market with the best proven technology that each
could provide. The five organisations were:
•
Pratt and Whitney -- Combustion Chamber and High Pressure Turbine.
•
Japanese Aero engine Corporation (JAEC) - Fan and Low Pressure
Compressor.
•
Rolls Royce plc - United Kingdom.
•
•
Pratt and Whitney - USA.
Motoren Turbinen Union (MTU) - Low Pressure Turbine.
•
Japanese Aero Engines Corporation.
•
Fiat Aviazione - External Gearbox.
•
MTU-Germany.
•
Fiat Aviazione -Italy.
In December of the same year the collaboration was incorporated in
Zurich, Switzerland, as IAE International Aero Engines AG, a management
company established to direct the entire program for the shareholders.
The headquarters for IAE were set up in East Hartford, Connecticut, USA
and the V2500 turbofan engine to power the 120-180 seat aircraft was
launched on January 1st 1984. Each of the shareholder companies was
given the responsibility for developing and delivering one of the five
engine modules. They are:
Revision 2
Note: Rolls Royce have developed and introduced the wide chord fan to
the V2500 engine family. The senior partners Rolls Royce and Pratt and
Whitney assemble the engines at their respective plants in Derby England
and Middletown Connecticut USA. IAE is responsible for the co-ordination
of the manufacture and assembly of the engines. IAE is also responsible
for the sales, marketing and in service support of the V2500. Note: Fiat
Aviazione have since withdrawn as a risksharing partner, but still
remains as a Primary Supplier. Rolls Royce now has responsibility for
all external gearbox related activity.

IAE V2500 Engine/Airframe Applications The V2500 engine has been
designated the 'V' because International Aero Engines (IAE) was
originally a fivenation consortium. The 'V' is the Roman numeral for
five. The 2500 numbering indicated the first engine type to be released
into production. This engine was rated at 25000lbs of thrust. For ease
of identification of the present and all future variants of the V2500,
IAE has introduced an engine designation system.
Introduction
•
The designation V2500-D collectively describes all applications for the
Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft.
•
The V2500-A collectively describes all the applications for the Airbus
Industries aircraft.
This is irrespective of engine thrust rating. The number given after the
alpha indicates the mechanical standard of the engine. For example; •
•
All engines possess the V2500 numbering as a generic name.
•
The first three characters of the full designation are V25. This will
identify all the engines in the family.
•
The next two figures indicate the engines rated sea level takeoff
thrust.
•
The following letter shows the aircrafts manufacturer.
Note:
•
The last figure represents the mechanical standard of the engine.
The D5 variant is now no longer in production, however the engine is
still extensively overhauled and re-furbished.
V2527-A5.
The only engine exempt from these idents is the current service engine,
which is already certified to the designated V2500-A1. There is only one
standard of this engine rating and is utilised on the Airbus A320
aircraft.
This system will provide a clear designation of a particular engine as
well as a simple way of grouping by name engines with similar
characteristics.

Fan Cowl Doors (FCD) Purpose The two fan cowl doors provide for an
aerodynamically smooth exterior, while enclosing the fan case mounted
accessories. Location They are located about the fan casing. Four hinges
attach each fan cowl door to the aircraft pylon. Description The doors
extend rearwards from the inlet cowl to overlap leading edge of the 'C'
ducts. The A320 aircraft have a strake on the inboard cowl of each
engine, the right hand cowl on both engine 1 and lefthand cowl on engine
2. The A319 aircraft have strakes on both the left-hand and right hand
cowls on both engines 1 and 2. Fan cowls are interchangeable between the
A319 and A320 except for the strake configuration. Make sure the correct
configuration is installed. The fan cowl doors are constructed from
graphite skins enclosing an aluminium honeycomb inner.
are secured to each other by 4 quick release and adjustable latches.
Warning The fan cowl hold open struts must be in the extended position
and both struts must always be used to hold the doors open. Be careful
when opening the doors in winds of more than 26 knots (30 mph). The fan
cowl doors must not be opened in winds of more than 52 knots (60 mph).
SB V2500-NAC-71-0259 Introduces a device that holds the fan cowl doors
in a partial open position when the doors are unsupported by the struts.

Thrust Reverser C Ducts Purpose The thrust reverser C ducts provide for;
• An aerodynamically smooth exterior to minimise drag. • The fan bypass
ducting. • Reverse thrust for aircraft deceleration. Location The thrust
reverser C-ducts are hinged from the aircraft strut at the top and are
secured at the bottom by six latches.
The thrust reverser C-ducts can be opened for access to the core engine.
This allows maintenance to be carried out on the core engine while the
engine is installed to the aircraft. The thrust reverser C-ducts are
heavy, therefore hydraulic actuation is required to open them. Normal
aircraft engine lubrication oil is used in a hand-operated pump. The
thrust reverser C-ducts are held in the open position by two support
struts.
Description
•
The forward strut is a fixed length.
The thrust reverser C-ducts extend rearwards from the fan cowls to the
common nozzle assembly (CNA).
•
The rear strut is a telescopic support.
The thrust reverser C ducts; Form the cowling around the core engine
(inner barrel) to assist in stiffening the core engine (load-share).
Form the fan air duct between the fan case exit and the entrance to the
CNA. House the thrust reverser operating mechanism and cascades. Form
the outer cowling between the fan cowl doors and CNA. The thrust
reverser C-ducts are mostly constructed from composites but some
sections are metallic mainly aluminium for example the inner barrel,
blocker doors and links. Revision 2
Warning Both struts must always be used to support the thrust reverser
C-ducts in the open position. The unit weight is approximately 578 lbs
each. Serious injury to personnel working under the thrust reverser
C-ducts can occur if they are suddenly released. Note: Damage to the
hinge access panel (HAP) will occur if the C-ducts are opened with the
translating cowl in the deploy position. Damage to the wing leading edge
slats will occur if they are in the extended position when opening the
C-ducts.

Propulsion System
Combined Nozzle Assembly (CNA) Purpose The CNA allows the mixing of the
hot and cold stream gas flows to produce the resultant thrust. This
mixing of the hot and cold gas streams within the CNA reduces the
'thermal shear effect' of the gases exiting the propelling nozzle to
atmosphere. Additionally, acoustic properties of the CNA minimise still
further the noise levels produced by the gas stream. This system results
in the V2500 being one of the quietest engines in its class. An
important factor as current and future legislation regarding noise
pollution at airports is becoming a major issue. Location The CNA is
bolted to the rear flange of the turbine exhaust casing. There is no
fixing to the bottom of the pylon. Description The CNA: Forms the
exhaust unit. • Mixes the hot and cold gas streams and ejects the
combined flow to atmosphere through a single propelling nozzle. •
Completes the engine nacelle.

A monoball type universal joint. This gives the main support at the
front engine mount position. Two thrust links that are attached to; •
The cross beam of the engine mount.
The engine mounts transmit loads generated by the engine during aircraft
operation. Location The front engine mount is located at the rear of the
intermediate case at the core engine. The rear engine mount is located
on the LPT casing at TDC. Description Forward engine mount The forward
engine mount is designed to transmit the following loads; • Thrust
loads. • Side loads. • Vertical loads. The front mount is secured to the
intermediate case in three positions;
Revision 2
• Support brackets either side of the monoball location. Rear engine
mount The rear engine mount is designed to transmit the following loads;
• Torsional loads. • Side loads. • Vertical loads. The rear engine mount
has a diagonal main link that gives resistance to torsional movement of
the casing as a result of the hot gas passing through the turbines.
There is further support from two side links. These limit the engine
side to side movement and give vertical support.

situation has been the result incorrect maintenance practices. All
instances of Fan Cowl loss have occurred on first flight after
maintenance activity had recently taken place. SBN 71-0259 introduces a
modification that is designed to make the fan cowl doors more prominent
to the naked eye when they are open and in the down position. The fan
cowl doors have a modification that gives them an open appearance when
they are not closed and secured for flight.
Lower the fan cowl door and align the locating pins.

Engine Storage Caution: You must keep the engine in storage for too
long. The times given in the procedure are the maximum for which the
engine can be preserved. If the time engine is in preservation is to be
extended, you must do the full preservation procedure again. If these
procedures are not followed damage to the engine can occur. Caution: You
must do all the applicable procedures when an engine is put into
storage. If they are not, corrosion and general deterioration of the
core engine and the fuel system can occur. The task 72-00-00-500-001
gives details of the required procedures for preservation and storage of
the engine or QEC unit that is to be stored or transported. Protective
treatment for the engine is dependant on the climatic conditions in
which the engine is to be stored. Refer to task 72-00-00-500-002.
Revision 2
Propulsion System
Prepare the engine for storage. Additional storage requirements refer to
fig below. 72-00-00990-243. Note: 1. The use of VMI bags affords maximum
protection to the engine/QEC unit and must be utilised wherever
possible, regardless of the storage environment and time period. 2. Use
a full polythene cover or similar, secured around the engine, and engine
stand preventing the ingress of dirt, grit and sand. 3. If the same
conditions can be achieved, without the use of a VMI, use full engine
protection from direct and indirect moisture as well as protection from
adverse weather conditions and ingress of any type, then this is
allowed. Desiccant must still be used in accordance with TASK

IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance
The purpose of fire protection is to give an indication to the flight
deck of a possible fire condition about the engine. The purpose of the
ventilation system is to provide a flow of cooling air about the engine
to reduce the risk of a fire condition annunciation to the flight deck.
Location The locations of the fire detection fire wires are about the
fan casing and core engine. The location of the ventilation air is about
the entire of the fan case and core engine. Description The engine is
ventilated to provide a cooling airflow for maintaining the engine
components within an acceptable operating temperature.
Fire Protection and Ventilation
Zone 1 ventilation Ram air enters the zone through an inlet located on
the upper LH side of the air intake cowl. The air circulates through the
fan compartment and exits at the exhaust located on the bottom rear
centre line of the fan cowl doors. Zone 2 ventilation Metered holes
within the inner barrel of the "C" duct allow pressurized fan air to
enter the zone 2 area. Air exhausting from the active clearance control
(ACC) system around the turbine area also provides ventilation air for
Zone 2.
Also to provide a flow of air that assists in the removal of potential
combustible liquids that may be in the area.
The air circulates through the core compartment and exits through the
lower bifurcation of the C ducts via the thrust recovery duct.
Ventilation is provided for;
Ventilation during ground running
•
The fan case area (Zone 1).
•
The core engine area (Zone 2).
During ground running local pockets of natural convection exist
providing some ventilation of the fan case zone 1.
Zones 1 and 2 are ventilated to; •
Prevent accessory and component over heating.
•
Prevent the accumulation of flammable vapours.
Revision 2
Zone 2 ventilation is provided by fan duct pressure as above, during
ground running and flight.

Fire Detection System Purpose The fire detection system monitors the air
temperature in Zone 1 and Zone 2.
Zone 1 and Zone 2 fire detectors function independently of each other.
When the air temperature increases to a pre determined level the system
provides flight deck warning.
Each zone has two detector units which are mounted as a pair, each unit
gives an output signal when a fire or overheat condition occurs.
Location The fire detection system is located: •
Routed around the high-speed external gearbox.
•
At BDC of the core engine nearest to the combustor diffuser case.
Description
The two detector units are attached to support tubes by clips. Nacelle
air temperature (NAC) Zone 2 has the nacelle air temperature sensor.
Indication is to the flight deck when a temperature exceedance has
occurred.
The V2500 utilises a Systron Donner fire detection system. It has a gas
filled core and relies upon heat exposure to increase the internal gas
pressure. Thus triggering sensors. When the air temperature about the
fan case and/or core engine increases to a pre-determined level the
system is designed to detect this and display a warning message and
indications to the flight deck. The system provides flight deck warning
by: •
Master warning light.
•
Audible warning tone.
•
Specific ECAM fire indications.
•
Engine fire push button illuminates.

Fire Detection System and Detector Units
Firewire detectors
The fire detection system employs detector units called firewires.
Each of the firewire detector units comprises of the following;
The firewires are mounted in pairs. This is necessary due to the level 3
class 1 message that they generate when a fire or overheat condition
exists.
•
A hollow sensor tube.
•
A responder assembly.
The fire detection system comprises of the following units;
Sensor tube
•
The firewires send a signal to the Fire Detection Unit (FDU).
The sensor tube is closed and sealed at one end and the other open end
is connected to the responder.
•
The FDU sends a signal to the Flight Warning Computer (FWC).
The tube is filled with helium gas and carries a central core of ceramic
material impregnated with hydrogen.
•
The FWC generates the flight deck indications for a fire condition.
An increase in the air temperature around the sensor tube causes the
helium to expand and increase until the pressure causes the alarm switch
to close. The FDU recognises this as an abnormal situation, hence fire
indication will be illuminated.
There is one FDU per engine. The FDU has two channels, each channel is
looking at a separate fire detector loop of zones 1 and 2. Under normal
conditions both firewires require to be indicating to the FDU to give a
real indication to the flight deck.
If a 'burn through' occurs, the pressure within the sensing tube is lost
and as a result of this the integrity switch opens to give an indication
to the FDU of a loop failure.
If there is a single loop failure of more than 16 seconds then the
remaining firewire will continue to operate. The FDU will recognise the
faulty fire loop.
Responder
The faulty loop will be indicated to ECAM as the following message;
•
The normally open switch is the alarm indication.
•
The normally closed switch is the fault indication.
ENG 1 (2) FIRE LOOP A (B) FAULT
The responder has two pressure switches, one normally open and the other
normally closed.
If there is a double loop failure then the FDU will recognise this as a
possible burn through and the fire message will be generated to the
flight deck. Revision 2

Fire Detection System Fire Bottles Purpose The fire bottles provide a
means of extinguishing a potentially hazardous fire about the engine
when a fire annunciation to the flight deck has occurred.
The discharge head has a leak proof diaphragm that is designed to
rupture when: •
The squib is activated from the flight deck.
Location
•
Excessive pressure in the fire bottle. 1600 to 1800 psi at 95 deg.C
The engine fire bottles are located in the aircraft strut. Access for
maintenance is via a panel that can be found on the left hand side.
Description The fire bottles have the following features; •
Agent type is bromotrifluoromethane.
•
Charged to a nominal pressure of 600 psi at 21 deg.C.
•
Pressure switch.
•
Discharge head.
•

The squib is an Electro Pyrotechnic Cartridge containing explosive
powder. Two filaments ignite the powder when they are supplied with 28v
dc. There is facility to carry out a fire system test that will give all
the expected indications if all is functioning correctly. The fire test
switch is located on the fire push button panel on the overhead panel.
The pressure switch is set to indicate bottle empty when the pressure
falls below 225 psi. The indication in the flight deck is; AGENT 1 (2)

Bearing Compartments Front Compartment The No's 1, 2 and 3 bearings are
located in the front bearing compartment which is at the centre of the
intermediate module (32). The compartment is sealed using air supported
carbon seals, plus an oil filled (Hydraulic) seal between the H.P. and
L.P. shafts. The 8th stage compressor air supports this seal. Adequate
pressure drops across the seals to ensure satisfactory sealing are
achieved by venting the compartment, by an external tube to the
de-oiler. Gearbox Drive The HP Stubshaft, which is located axially by
the Number 3 Bearing, has at it's front end a bevel drive gear which,
through the 'Tower Shaft' provides the drive for the Main Accessory
Gearbox. The HP Stubshaft separates from the HP Compressor Module at the
'Curvic Coupling' and remains as part of the Intermediate Module.

Bearing Compartments Front Compartment (Continued) The drawing below
shows details of the Number 2 and Number 3 Bearings. A Phonic Wheel is
fitted to the LP Stub Shaft; this interacts with speed probes to provide
LP Shaft speed signals (N1) to the Engine Electronic Control (EEC) (see
section 11 -- Engine Indicating). A speed signal is also provided to the
Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU), which is located in the
Aircraft Avionics Compartment. The Hydraulic Seal prevents oil leakage
from the compartment passing rearwards between the H.P. and L.P. shafts.
The Number 3 Bearing is hydraulically damped. The outer race is
supported by a series of eighteen spring rods, which allow some slight
radial movement of the bearing. The bearing is centralised by rods and
any radial movement is dampened by oil pressure fed to an annulus around
the bearing outer race. The gearbox gear is splined onto the H.P. shaft
and retained by the Number 3 Bearing Nut.

No 4 (Centre) Bearing Compartment The No 4 bearing compartment is
situated in an inherently hostile, high temperature and pressure
environment at the centre of the combustion section. The bearing
compartment is shielded from radiated heat by a heat shield and an
insulating supply of relatively cool air. This supply of cooled air
(called 'buffer air') is admitted to the space between the chamber and
first heat shield. The buffer air is exhausted from the cooling spaces
close to the upstream side of the carbon seals, creating an area of
cooler air from which the sealing function is obtained. This results in
an acceptable temperature of the air flowing across the face of the
carbon seals into the bearing compartment. Restrictors at the outlet
from the cooling passage control buffer airflow rates. The bearing
compartment internal pressure level is determined by the area of the
variable scavenge valve. (No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve described in the
oil system). Essentially this valve acts as a variable flow restrictor
in the No 4 Bearing Compartment vent line.

No 5 Bearing (Rear) Bearing Compartment The rear bearing compartment is
located at the centre of the L.P. turbine module (module 50) and houses
the No 5 bearing which supports the L.P. turbine rotor. An air supported
(Stage 8) carbon seal seals the compartment at the front end. At the
rear is a simple cover plate, with an 'O' ring type seal, secured by
twelve bolts. Inside the compartment sealing is achieved on the LP shaft
end by a small disc type plug, with a 'spring supported jacket cup' ring
seal secured by a double helix spring clip. There are no air or oil
flows down the LP shaft. Separate venting is not necessary for this
compartment because with only one carbon seal, the airflow induced by
the scavenge pump provides the required pressure drop across the seal.
The pressure supply and scavenge oil pipes are covered by an insulating
heat shield material.

LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance
Nose Cone The Glass-fibre cone smoothes the airflow into the fan. It is
secured to the front blade-retaining ring by 24 bolts. A Fairing is
attached to the front blade-retaining ring by 6 bolts. Note: Balance
weights must not be placed at these 6 bolt locations on the fairing. The
Nose Cone is balanced during manufacture by applying weights to its
inside surface. The nose cone is un-heated. A soft rubber cone tip
provides ice protection. As ice builds up on the tip, it becomes
un-balanced and flexes. This causes the ice to be dislodged from the
rubber tip and is then ingested by the fan before it has built up to a
significant mass. The Nose Cone retaining bolt flange is faired by a
titanium fairing which is secured by six bolts. The arrangement is shown
below. Note: Take care when removing the Nose Cone retaining bolts.
Balance weights may be fitted to some of the bolts. The position of
these bolts with their respective weights must be marked before removal,
so as to ensure they are refitted to the same position.

Front Blade Retaining Ring The Assembly is shown below. The Front Blade
Retaining Ring is secured to the Fan Disk by a ring of 36 bolts. A
second (outer ring) passes through the retaining ring and permits the
individual securing of the Annulus Fillers by 22 bolts. Both these sets
of bolts must be removed before attempting to remove the Front Blade
Retaining Ring. After the removal of the 22 annulus filler securing
bolts and all 36 retaining ring bolts, it is possible to remove the
front blade retaining ring by the use of 6 'pusher bolts being inserted
into 6 threaded holes designed specifically for this purpose. Note: The
fan blades and annulus filler positions are not identified. For this
reason it is important to identify and make a note of the original blade
and annulus filler positions prior to their removal. When the Nose Cone
is fitted, it is possible to identify the positions of blades numbers
1,2 and 3 by noting that the front blade retaining ring has etched on
it's outer edge these blade number positions. These numbers are marked
in a counter-clockwise direction when viewing the engine from the front.
Having established the original positions of the blades it is important
to number the blades and their corresponding annulus filler by using an
approved marker pen (Material VS 06-69 ref 70-30-00). Revision 2

Fan Trim Balance Procedure Reference 71-00-00-860-010 Engine Operation
Limits, Guidelines and Special Procedures. Vibration limits and fan
guidelines: a)
trim balance vibration
Vibration Limits (Steady State) −
N1 (peak): 5.0 Units.
−
N2 (peak): 5.0 Units.
1.  Engines that have vibrations within the vibration limits are
    acceptable.
2.  Engines that have N1 peak vibrations that exceeds the above limit,
    troubleshoot as per Trouble Shooting Manual (ref. TSM task
    77-30-00-810-826) or (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-827).
3.  Engines that have N2 peak vibrations that exceeds the above limit,
    troubleshoot as per Trouble Shooting Manual (ref. TSM task
    77-30-00-810-828) or (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-829).
4.  A non-revenue ferry flight to a maintenance base is permissible with
    N1 or N2 vibration above limits, if no fault in the respective
    trouble shooting procedures in steps 2 and 3 above. This condition
    is permissible for only one engine per aircraft.
Revision 2
b)  Vibration guidelines −
N1 (peak): 2.0 Units
1.  Fan trim balance is recommended any time N1 peak vibration exceeds
    this 2.0 Unit guideline. Perceivable airframe vibrations generally
    accompany N1 vibration levels above this guideline value. Waiting
    until N1 peak vibration approaches or exceeds the 5.0 unit limit may
    require multiple fan trim balances to bring N1 vibration down to an
    acceptable value. Note: 5.0 units (Aircraft ECAM display) = 1.5
    inches per second of displacement due to the imbalance.

− As stated in the FCOM, if N2 vibration during engine start exceeds
limit, the start should be aborted. Subsequent starts may be initiated
without maintenance action for up to three start attempts. − The above
limits and guidelines are stable (steady state) and as such may not be
stable, therefore the aircraft level is advisory and not a limit.
Vibration above the advisory level may or may not require maintenance
action, as described in the FCOM; initially depending on icing
conditions or other engine parameter shifts and finally if the advisory
level is confirmed at steady state conditions.

Fan Trim Balance There are two methods available to balance the fan, the
'one shot' and 'trial weight' the method. Both use data gained from the
Engine Vibration Monitoring system (EVMS).
Caution:
The one shot method allows balancing of the fan with fewer engine ground
runs required and has proved itself effective in service use.
An N1 Keep-Out-Zone (KOZ) of 61-74% N1 (AOW1056) has been introduced
during all stages of engine operation on the ground, including Ground
Testing, Taxiing and 'Hold' periods. This is to prevent the blade from
experiencing high stresses as a result of 'Fan Blade flutter'. This is
particularly acute during 'cross-wind' conditions. The KOZ is being
incorporated into EEC software (availability A5 SCN17-3rd Qtr 2002)
If necessary a Vibration survey (Test No 8) may be performed to obtain
the vibration characteristics of the engine. Note: • If vibration
exceeds limits during the survey ground run, slowly bring engine speed
to idle and shutdown. • Angles are counter clockwise viewed from the
front of the engine. Data: (speed, amplitude and phase angle) may be
collected on ground or during cruise flight, collection in flight is
either automatic or for selected speeds and on the ground may be
manually selected ref: AMM.
Operate both engines for this test with the non-test engine set at 1.25
EPR for aircraft stability. Engine speed greater than 85% N1 (4645 rpm)
can cause aircraft buffeting.
For cruise flight, data at 5 speeds, pre-selected or automatically is
collected. Data stored in the memory of the EVMU is accessed through the
MCDU menu in the flight deck and should be printed for later reference
and calculation.
Best results are obtained from data in the 80-90% N1 speed range with
85% N1 being the best single speed point, for ground running an average
of correction.

One Shot Method The following procedure may be used to trim balance an
engine fan whilst mounted on the aircraft wing. The data collection will
be via the aircraft EVMU system. Data may be collected during a ground
run or in cruise flight. Definitions •
Speed (N1) expressed as a percentage 100% = 5650 rpm. Note! (1% N1 =

Acquire in flight, read on ground) or Task 77-32-34-869010 (Acquisition
of unbalance data on ground). Some aircraft are fitted with software
(customer option) which permits the engineer to interrogate via the MCDU
the stored data regarding out of balance correction required. This
information is contained in the EVMU and by accessing the EVMU Engine
Unbalance menu, it is possible to establish the necessary adjustments
required to eliminate out of balance situations. Note:
•
Phase Angle (A) indicated angle in degrees from the EVMU system.
•
Phase Lag (B) dynamic phase lag of the LP system between phase angle and
true position of unbalance.
Prior to carrying out any adjustments, the engineer must first confirm
the accuracy of the current status regarding the configuration of
weights (position and part number) that are already installed and
recorded in the system.
Mass Coefficient (K) value by which the amplitude must be multiplied to
give correction mass required or a given speed
To accomplish this it is necessary to physically verify the position and
part number of the balance weights already installed onto the front

Fan Trim Balance with the EVMU (One Shot Method) Task (77-32-34-750-010)
This procedure can be used for consecutive fan trim balances if
necessary. If consecutive fan trim balances with this method do not give
significant results, carryout a fan trim balance with the 'Trial Weight'
method. Reference Task (77-32-34-750-010-01) to carryout either of these
procedures, flight or ground vibration data must be available. Reference

Annulus Fillers After removal of the Front Blade retaining ring the
Annulus Fillers can be removed as follows: •
lift the front end of the Annulus Filler 3 to 4 inches
•
twist the Annulus Filler counter-clockwise
•
draw the Annulus Filler forward to clear the blades
through
about 60 degrees
Remove the annulus fillers on either side of the blade to be removed.
The blade to be removed can than be pulled forward to clear the dovetail
slot in the fan disc. Examine the outer surface of the Annulus Filler
for cracks, nicks, dents and scores. Limits in the AMM can be applied to
assess the damage for accept or reject. If the surface coating of the
annulus filler is damaged to the point of requiring a repair the AMM has
a procedure that allows this to be done. AMM ref 72-31-11-300-010 gives
comprehensive instructions as to the correct procedure for repair.

Annulus Fillers Caution: When re-fitting the Annulus Fillers, it is
extremely important that correct location of the Annulus Fillers into
the Rear Retaining Ring is achieved. If the Annulus Filler is not
correctly installed, it is possible that when the Front Retaining Ring
is subsequently torque tightened in place onto the Fan Disk, it may
result in the deformation and displacement of the Rear Retaining Ring.
This could cause it to come into contact with the inlet housing of LP
Compressor Module.

Reposition of the Annulus Filler Seals AMM (72-31-11-300-017)
Procedure
During the installation of the Annulus Filler it is possible to cause
the sealing strips to be incorrectly seated.
•
Push the plastic between the Fan Blade and the Annulus Filler at the
rear of the Fan.
If this were to be left uncorrected, it is possible that the Fan Blade
would be displaced slightly prevented from it's normal radial operating
position.
•
Note: If this is difficult to do, it can be an indication that the seal
is caught.
•
Slide the plastic strip forward to move the seal into the correct
position. Accomplish this procedure on both sides of the Fan Blade
starting at the trailing edge of the blade and moving it forward to the
leading edge.
•
Note: When the seal is in the correct position you can easily move the
plastic strip from the front to the rear of the blade.
This in turn would cause the Fan Module to become unbalanced and
vibration levels for the engine could be exceeded. The task referenced
above documents the procedure to eliminate this. The task requires a
stiff plastic strip to be used to reposition the seals if they ' rolled'
as shown in the diagram below. Note: An expired credit card is suitable,
or a plastic checklist card Caution: Make sure the plastic strip has a
smooth surface and edges. If you use a strip with a rough edge surface
or edges, damage to the seal can occur. Make sure that you do not break
the plastic strip and leave pieces of it in the Fan. Pieces of plastic
can damage the rubber.

Introduction of LPC Rotor Balancing Procedure in Fan Blade Replacement.
AMM 72-31-11-400-010
Method 3
When a replacement blade is installed, procedures to keep the balance of
the LP compressor rotor are necessary.
Method 3 uses a pair of replacement blades. The moment weight difference
of the damaged blade position is compensated by non-damaged blade
replacement at a diametrically opposite position.
There are four methods used to correct the balance in this task. These
are: •
Method 1.
•
Method 2.
•
Method 3.
•
Method 4.
The methods can be selected according to the conditions of damage seen
on the LPC rotor. Method 1 Method 1 uses the trim balance weights on the
36 bolt hole flange (front blade retaining ring) to compensate the
moment weight difference between the removed and installed blade.
Method 4 In method 4, the distribution of all the 22 fan blades is
changed. Removal and installation of all blades is necessary. When two
or more blades are replaced, select the applicable method in each case
if method 4 is not used. Note: Seven methods of fan blade installation
procedure are given in this task. Four of the seven methods are used
when balance correction is applied. The remaining three methods are used
when the balance correction is not applied. (see chart below)
Method 2 Method 2 uses the balance weights on the 22 bolt hole flange
(front blade retaining ring) to compensate for the moment weight
difference.

Fan Blade Repairs Detailed information regarding the repair of damage on
the Low Pressure Compressor (LPC) Fan Blades by local material removal
can be found in the AMM Task (72-3111-300-016). Repair Scheme VRS1506.
Caution: •
The maximum number of dressed blades for a given Compressor Fan Blade
set, is the equivalent of three blades dressed to the maximum limit. The
remaining blades must not be dressed.
•
Titanium component -- You must use silicon carbide type abrasive wheel
stones and papers to dress, blend and polish the Fan Blade.
•
Titanium component -- Do not use force with mechanical cutters or the
material will become too hot.
•
Titanium component -- If the material shows a change in colour to darker
than a light straw colour, the Fan Blade is to be rejected.
Note: The repair scheme VRS1506 allows scalloping of the leading edge of
the fan blade. Remove damage from the airfoil surface and if damage is
found in Zone 'AD' then you must blend parallel with the leading edge,
by removing material above the repaired area.

Repair of Fan Blade Chocking Pads AMM (72-31-11-300-019) Repair Scheme
Number VRS 1063 Should the Chocking Pads become detached from the Fan
Blade, it is possible to carryout a repair utilising the referenced task
above. Background VRS 1063 is an existing AMM repair for the
reattachment of LPC fan blade chocking pads, which can become detached
during engine running and during removal of fan blades. Early standard
blades have pads which are bonded to the fan blades using silicoset
rubber compound and later standard blades have stick-on pads which use a
double sided adhesive tape. The two configurations are called 'Assembly
A' and 'Assembly B' in the repair. The purpose of the amendment to the
repair is to include a procedure for a replacement of the stick-on pads
and also to add the Uni-Directionally Profiled (UDP) blade part numbers
6A6519 for (A1) engines and 6A6521 for (A5/D5) engines.

Repair of the Fan Disk Rear Ramp During the removal operation of a fan
blade, it is possible to dislodge the rear ramp from its location in the
'dove-tail' slot in the fan disk. Great care must be taken to inspect
the fan disk and the security of the rear ramps, as they play an
important role in providing a firm fixing and support for the individual
fan blades. Should it be discovered that a rear ramp has become
separated from the disk it must be refitted/replaced and a full
description of the task can be found in the AMM task reference
72-31-12-300-010. This is summarised as follows: Remove the stage 1 fan
blade from the stage 1 fan disk assembly
Bond the rear ramp to the disk: •
Apply masking tape to the rear ramp. Using masking tape (Material
No. V02-019) Note! The masking tape is used in order to allow the
engineer to hold and place the rear ramp accurately in the dovetail
slot. See diagram on next page.
•
Apply the adhesive to the disk and rear ramp bond areas. Use toughened
acrylic adhesive with initiator (Material No. V08-114) Use a small
spatula or trowel to apply the adhesive. Note The four 'pips' on the
rear ramp, are to ensure adequate thickness of adhesive is maintained
between the mating surfaces. See diagram on next page.
•
Fix the rear ramp to the fan disk and remove the masking tape from the
rear ramp.
•
Use finger pressure to hold the rear ramp in position for three minutes.
•
Cure the adhesive for one hour at room temperature between 21 deg. C.
and 25 deg. C.
•
Visually and dimensionally examine the bonded rear ramp.
•
Install the stage 1 fan blade to the fan disk assembly.
Clean the disk and rear ramp bonding surfaces: •
•
Hand abrade the disk and rear ramp bonding area, using a scotch brite
pad (material No. V05-126) or garnet paper (Material No. V05-017) Swab
degrease the disk and rear ramp bonding areas, using a clean lint-free
cloth made moist with methyl ethyl keytone (material No. V01-076)
Caution: Mating surfaces of the component must be scrupulously clean and
contact surfaces must not be touched by hand or otherwise contaminated.
Bonding must be carried out immediately following surface preparation

Repair of the Stage 1 Fan Disk After removal of a fan blade it is also
necessary to carryout an inspection of the fan disk in accordance with
the AMM task 72-31-12-200-010. This task includes the examination of the
dovetail slots for peeling of the dry film lubricant. (Use a dental
mirror in order to accomplish this. If there is any amount of peeling of
dry film lubricant, carryout the repair VRS1149 in accordance with the
AMM Ref task 72-31-12-300-011.This is summarised as follows: 1. Remove
the stage 1 fan blade from the stage 1 fan disk assembly:
5.  Visually examine the dry film lubricant on the dovetail slot of the
    disk. Use a dental mirror: • The layer must be smooth and bonded
    correctly to the surface of the part. • The layer must not have any
    flakes or cracks.
6.  Identify the repair: • A log book entry is necessary when you have
    touched up the slot surface of over 50%. Write VRS1149 in the engine
    log book.
7.  Clean the missing coat areas on the dovetail slot: • Use a lint-free
    cloth made moist with clean isopropyl alcohol (Material
    No. V01-124).
8.  Apply the dry film lubricant to the dovetail slot of the disk: •
    Touch up the dry film lubricant to the missing coat areas with a
    clean brush (Material No. V01-005), use multipurpose high load dry
    lubricant (Material No.V10-005) or bonded lubricant (Material
    No. V10-106). • Apply three coats of the dry lubricant to the total
    thickness of between 0.001 and 0.002 in (0.025 and 0.051mm) to
    surface 'BJ' (see diagram below).
9.  Air dry as follows: • If V10-005 multi-purpose high load dry
    lubricant was used, dry for 20 minutes • If V10-106 bonded lubricant
    was used, dry for 30 minutes. Revision 1

The Engine Electronic Control (EEC) Description The EEC is a dual
channel control unit that utilises a split housing design. The assembled
unit is sealed with a housing seal and a protective shield provides
channel separation. The control assembly is separated into two modules,
each containing one control channel. Each module contains two
multi-layer printed circuit boards assemblies, which enable it to
function independently of the other channel.
Electronic Engine Control
Each of the EEC channels can exercise full control of all engine
functions. Control alternates between Channel A and Channel B for
consecutive flights, the selection of the controlling channel being made
automatically by the EEC itself. The channel not in control is nominated
as the back up channel. .
A mating connector provides 'Crosstalk', for partial or complete channel
switching and fault isolation logic when the two modules are joined.
This connector also provides for the exchange of 'crosslink data', cross
wiring and hardwired discretes between the two channels. The EEC has two
identical electronic circuits that are identified as Channel A and
Channel B. Each channel is supplied with identical data from the
aircraft and the engine. This data includes throttle position, aircraft
digital data, air pressures, air temperatures, exhaust gas temperatures
and rotor speeds. The EEC, to set the correct engine rating for the
flight conditions uses this data. The EEC also transmits engine
performance data to the aircraft. This data is used in cockpit display,
thrust management and condition monitoring systems. Revision 2

Engine Electronic Control (EEC.) Overview The EEC provides the following
engine control functions:• Power Setting (E.P.R.). • Acceleration and
deceleration times. • Idle speed governing. • Overspeed limits (N1 and
N2). • Fuel flow. • Variable stator vane system (V.S.V.) • Compressor
handling bleed valves. • Booster stage bleed valve (B.S.B.V.). • Turbine
cooling (10 stage make-up air system). • Active clearance control
(A.C.C.). • Thrust reverser. • Automatic engine starting. • Oil and fuel
temperature management. Note: The fuel cut off (engine shut down)
command comes from the flight crew and is not controlled by the EEC.
Fault Monitoring The EEC has extensive self test and fault isolation
logic built in. This logic operates continuously to detect and isolate
defects in the EEC. Revision 2

Purpose
Then using the EEC Harness Wrench torque tighten the DEP connector to 32
lbf in.
The Data Entry Plug (DEP) provides discrete data inputs to the EEC.
Located on to Junction 6 of the EEC. it provides unique engine data to
Channel A and B. The data transmitted by the DEP is: • EPR Modifier
(Used for power setting). • Engine Rating (Selected from multiple rating
options). • Engine Serial No.
The DEP links the coded data inputs through the EEC by the use of
shorting jumper leads which are used to select the plug pins in a unique
combination. During the life of an engine, it may be necessary to change
the DEP configuration, either during incorporation of Service Bulletins
or after engine overhaul, when the EPR Modifier code may need to be
changed.
Location The data entry plug is located on the channel B side electrical
connectors of the EEC. During removal/replacement of the DEP it is
necessary to use an EEC harness wrench, as it is imperative that the
connectors are tight. On fitment of the DEP to the EEC align the main
key of the

This is accomplished by changing the configuration of the jumper leads

Electronic Engine Control Failures and Redundancy Improved reliability
is achieved by utilising dual sensors, dual control channels, dual
selectors and dual feedback. • Dual sensors are used to supply all EEC
inputs except pressures, (single pressure transducers within the EEC
provide signals to each channel - A and B). • The EEC uses identical
software in each of the two channels. Each channel has its own power
supply, processor, programme memory and input/output functions. The mode
of operation and the selection of the channel in control is decided by
the availability of input signal and output controls. • Each channel
normally uses its own input signals but each channel can also use input
signals from the other channel required i.e. if it recognises faulty, or
suspect, inputs. • An output fault in one channel will cause switchover
to control from the other channel. • In the event of faults in both
channels a pre-determined hierarchy decides which channel is more
capable of control and utilises that channel. • In the event of loss of
either channels, or loss of electrical power, the systems are designed
to go to the fail safe positions.

Operation and Control EEC Power Supplies The electrical supplies for the
EEC are normally provided by a dedicated alternator, which is mounted on
and driven by the external gearbox.
test power for EEC maintenance.
Dedicated Alternator
During engine starts 28V DC is supplied from the aircraft bus bars until
the dedicated alternator comes 'on line' at approximately 10% N2.
The permanent magnet alternator has two independent sets of stator
windings that supply two independent, 3 phase frequency AC outputs to
the EEC. These unregulated AC supplies are rectified to 28 volts DC
within the EEC
Switching between the aircraft 28V supply and dedicated alternator power
supplies is done automatically by the EEC so in the event of a total
failure of the dedicated alternator the EEC is supplied from the
aircraft 28V DC bus bars,
The Dedicated Alternator also supplies N2 signals for the EEC. This is
provided by the frequency of a single phase winding in the stator
housing as the 'primary' speed signal used by both Channels of the EEC
and for the Flight Deck instrument display of engine actual speed.
Should this signal fail, there is a 'Back-up' signal which is derived
from one of the three phase windings of Channel 'B' power generation.
There is no speed signal generation provided by the output of the coil
windings of the Dedicated Alternator Channel 'A' power supply. The EEC
also utilises aircraft power to operate some engine systems: •
115 volts AC 400 Hz power is required for the ignition system and inlet
probe anti-icing heater.
•
28V DC is required for some specific functions, which include the thrust
reverser, fuel on/off and ground

Dedicated Alternator Cooling Shroud Location It is important that the
cooling shroud is orientated correctly for the differing variant
engines. The shroud must be clamped with the arrow on the shroud aligned
with the number '1' indicated position for A5 and A1 applications. For
D5 applications only the arrow on the clamp must align with the number
'2' indicated position. With the arrow aligned make sure that the dowel
on the shroud engages in the adjacent cooling hole on the casing, this
correctly aligns the cooling air inlet on the shroud with the cooling
hole in the casing. Tighten the nut on the shroud to hold the shroud
firmly in the correct position. Torque the nut on the alternator shroud
to 180 -- 220 lbfin (20 -- 25 Nm) Connect the tube to the alternator
shroud and torque tighten the tube nut to 283 -- 310 lbfin (32 -- 35 Nm)
Safety the tube with locking wire. Connect the electrical connectors and
torque them to 16 lbfin (1,8 Nm) If this is not carried out, the cooling
airflow may not be able to enter the stator housing due to the cooling
air hole on the stator being masked by the clamp body of the cooling
shroud. The diagram below shows both arrangements and their relevant
application.

Power Management
Power Management Purpose The power management system is designed to
allow the control of engine power by either manual or auto throttle
control. Location The aircraft throttle is located in the flight deck.
This is in reference to the TLA resolvers. The EEC is engine
intermediate case mounted. This is in reference to the TRA signal that
is derived from TLA. Description The throttle control lever (Thrust
Lever) is based on the "fixed throttle" concept; there is no motorised
movement of the throttle levers. Each throttle control lever drives dual
throttle resolvers; each resolver output is dedicated to one EEC
channel. The throttle lever angle (TLA) is the input to the resolver.
The resolver output, which is fed to the EEC, is known as the Throttle
Resolver Angle (TRA). The relationship between the throttle lever angle
and the throttle resolver angle is linear therefore: 1 deg TLA = 1.9 deg

Throttle Control Lever Mechanism The throttle control mechanism for one
engine is shown below. The control system consists of: • The throttle
control lever. • The mechanical box. • The throttle control unit. The
throttle control lever movement is transmitted through a rod to the
mechanical box. The mechanical box incorporates 'soft' detents, which
provides selected engine ratings, it also provides "artificial feel" for
the throttle control system. A second rod to the throttle control unit
transmits the output from the mechanical box. The throttle control unit
incorporates two resolvers and six potentiometers. Each resolver is
dedicated to one EEC channel; the output from the potentiometers
provides T.L.A. signals to the aircraft flight management computers. A
rig pin position is provided on the throttle control unit for rigging
the resolvers and potentiometers.

Bump Rating Push Button (A1 Engined Aircraft only) In some cases
(optional) the throttle control levers are provided with "Bump" rating
push buttons, one per engine. This enables the EEC to be re-rated to
provide additional thrust capability for use during specific aircraft
operations. Note: Bump Ratings can be selected, regardless of TLA only
in EPR mode when aircraft is on ground. Bump Ratings can be de-selected
at any time by actuating the bump rating push button, as long as the
aircraft is on the ground and the Thrust Lever is not in the Max
Take-Off detent. In flight, the bump ratings are fully removed when the
Thrust Lever is moved from the Take-Off detent to or below the Max
Continuous detent. The Bump Rating is available in flight (EPR or N1
mode) under the following conditions: •
Bump Rating is initially selected on ground.
•
Take-Off, Go Around TOGA Thrust position set.
•
Aircraft is within the Take-Off envelope.
When Bump Rating is selected a 'B' appears next to the associated EPR
display. Use of Bump must be recorded.
Flexible Takeoff (A1 &amp; A5 Engine Aircraft) Definition of Flexible
Takeoff: In many instances, the aircraft takes off with a weight lower
than the maximum permissible takeoff weight. When this happens, it can
meet the required performance with a decreased thrust that is adapted to
the weight: This is called 'Flexible Takeoff' and the thrust is called
'Flexible Takeoff Thrust'. The use of Flexible Takeoff Thrust saves
engine life. The maximum permissible takeoff weight decreases as
temperature increases, so it is possible to assume a temperature at
which the actual takeoff weight would be the limiting one. This
temperature is called 'Flexible Temperature' or 'Assumed Temperature'
and is entered into the FADEC via the MCDU PERF TO page in order to get
the adapted thrust. Note! If the thrust 'Bump' is armed for takeoff and
flexible thrust is used, the pilot must use the Takeoff Performance
determined for the non-increased takeoff thrust (without Bump). •
Thrust must not be reduced by more than 25% of the full rated thrust.
When one Bump button is selected, both engines will be at the "Bump
Rated" value. Pressing Bump again deselects Bump Rating.

Throttle Control Lever Mechanism
Thrust Rating Limit
The throttle control lever moves over a range of 65 degrees, from minus
20 degrees to plus 45 degrees. An intermediate retractable mechanical
stop is provided at 0 degrees.
Thrust rating limit is computed according to the thrust lever position.
If the thrust lever is set in a detent the FADEC will select the rating
limit corresponding to this detent.
Forward Thrust Range The forward thrust range is from 0 degrees to plus
45 degrees. •
0 degrees = forward idle power.
•
45 degrees = rated take off power.
If the thrust lever is set between two detents the FADEC will select the
rating limit corresponding to the higher mode.
Two detents are provided in this range: • Max climb (MCLB) at 25
degrees. • Max continuous (MCT)/flexible (de-rated) take off power
(FLTO) at 35 degrees. Reverse Thrust Range Lifting the reverse latching
lever allows the throttle to operate in the range 0 degrees to minus 20
degrees. A detent at minus 6 degrees corresponds to thrust reverse
deploy commanded and reverse idle power, minus 20 degrees is max reverse
power. Auto Thrust System (ATS) The Auto Thrust System can only be
engaged between 0 degrees and plus 35 degrees. Two engine operation 0
degrees and Max Climb 25 degrees. One engine operation 0 degrees and Max
Cont 35 degrees.

EEC/Fuel System Interface Purpose To allow the throttle signal from the
flight deck to be received by the EEC. The EEC will convert this signal
into a fuel flow error in order to change the fuel flow for a power
level change. Description Movement of the pilots throttle control lever
is sensed by the dual resolvers, which signal the TRA to the EEC. The
EEC computes the fuel flow, which will produce the required thrust. The
computed fuel flow request is converted to an electrical current (I)
which drives the torque motor in the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) which
modulates fuel servo pressure to move the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) and
sets the fuel flow. A dual resolver senses movement of the FMV, which is
located in the fuel metering unit next to the FMV. The dual resolver
translates the fuel metering valve movement into an electrical feedback
signal that is fed back to the EEC.

Basic Control Loop
N1 Reversion
The EEC uses closed loop control based on Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR)
or, N1 if EPR is unobtainable.
In case of no EPR (either sensed or computed) available, an automatic
reversion to N1 mode is provided.
EPR Closed Loop Control The EEC computes a Target EPR as a function of:
•
TRA
(Throttle Resolver Angle).
•
T amb
(Ambient temperature).
•
T2
(Engine air inlet temperature).
•
Alt
(Altitude).
•
Mn
(Mach Number).
The EPR target is compared to the actual EPR to determine the EPR error.
The EPR error is converted to a rate controlled fuel flow command (WF),
which is summed with the measured fuel flow (WF actual) to produce the
WF error. The W.F. error is converted to a current (I), which is sent to
the FMU to drive the torque motor; this moves the FMV to change the fuel
flow. The change in fuel flow causes the engine to accelerate/decelerate
and brings about a change in actual EPR. This process continues until
there is no EPR error. Note: The EEC controls the rate of change of fuel
flow, and thus acceleration/deceleration times, as a function of the
rate of change of HP Compressor Speed (N2). Revision 2

Unrated N1 Mode Alternate Engine Control N1 Reversion At the reversion
to N1 mode (rated or unrated) an equivalent thrust to that achieved in
EPR mode is provided until a thrust lever position change. With both
engines now selected to N1 rated thrust control, they will now be
controlled to provide the required thrust levels dictated by thrust
lever physical position. As N1 mode is selected on both engines, the EPR
indication of both engines is not available on the upper ECAM screen.
Revision 2
If in addition to losing EPR parameters either T2 or Altitude data is
lost, then the EEC automatically reverts to unrated N1 thrust setting.
The unrated N1 thrust setting requires the thrust to be set manually to
an N1 speed. An over boost situation can occur in this mode at the full
forward thrust lever position. The N1 mode indication previously
displayed in blue on the upper ECAM is no longer displayed in unrated N1
mode. Note: This mode is a 'non-dispatchable mode'.

Thrust Modes
Memo Mode
The engine operates in one of three thrust modes:
The memo mode is entered automatically, from Auto mode if;
•
Auto.
• The EPR target is invalid.
•
Memo.
•
Manual.
• One of the instinctive disconnect buttons on the throttle is
activated.
Entering, exiting these three modes is controlled by inputs to the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU) Auto Thrust Mode The auto thrust mode is
only available between idle and MCT when the aircraft is in flight.
After take off the throttle is pulled back to the max climb position,
the auto-thrust system will be active and the Automatic Flight system
will provide an EPR target to provide either: -
• Auto thrust is disconnected by the EIU. In the 'Memo' mode the thrust
is 'frozen', to the last actual EPR value and will remain frozen until
the throttle lever is moved manually, or, auto thrust is reset. Manual
Thrust Mode This mode is entered anytime the conditions for AUTO or MEMO
are not present. In this mode thrust is a function of throttle lever
position.
• Max climb thrust. • An optimum thrust. • A minimum thrust. • An
aircraft speed (Mach number) in association with the autopilot.

Thrust Modes Manual Mode
After Takeoff
The engines are in the manual mode provided the A/THR function is:
− The pilot can change from the FLX to MCT by moving the thrust lever to
the Take Off Go Around (TOGA) or Climb (CL) detent, then back to MCT.
After that, they cannot use the FLX rating.
•
Not armed or
•
Armed and not active (Thrust lever not in the operating range and no
alpha floor).
In these conditions each engine is controlled by position of its thrust
lever. The pilot controls thrust by moving the thrust lever between IDLE
and TOGA positions. Each position of the thrust lever within these
limits corresponds to an EPR.
Note! Setting the thrust lever out of the FLX/MCT detent without
reaching the TOGA or CL detent has no effect. The pilot can always
demand Maximum Take Off thrust by pushing the thrust lever all the way
forward, to the TOGA position.
When the thrust lever is in a detent, the corresponding EPR is equal to
the EPR rating limit computed for that engine. When the thrust lever is
in the FLX/MCT detent On the ground −
The engine runs at the Flex takeoff thrust rating if the crew has
selected a flex takeoff temperature on the MCDU that is higher than the

Fuel System
Fuel System Introduction
Operation
Purpose
The aircraft pumps deliver the fuel to the engine LP pump.
The primary purpose of the fuel system is to provide a completely
controlled continuous fuel supply in a form suitable for combustion, to
the combustion system.
The LP pump boosts the initial fuel delivery to a pressure so as to
prevent low pressure entry into the HP pump. Nominal pressure 150psi.
Description
The fuel flows into the fuel oil heat exchangers for the engine and IDG.
Control of the fuel supply is by the EEC via the Fuel Metering Unit
(FMU). High pressure fuel is also used to provide servo pressure
(actuator muscle) for the following actuators; •
BSBV actuators.
•
VSV actuator.
•
ACC actuator.
•
ACOC actuator.
The major components of the fuel system include; • High and low pressure
fuel pumps (dual unit). • Fuel/oil heat exchanger. • Fuel filter. • Fuel
metering unit (FMU). • Fuel distribution valve. • Fuel injectors (20). •
Fuel diverter and back to tank valve (FDRV). The fuel system controls
are on the centre control pedestal and the indications are in the form
of an annunciator light and ECAM messages. Revision 2
Depending on the mode of operation the heat management system is in
depends on which direction the fuel will flow. From the engine FCOC the
fuel passes through the LP fuel filter. The filter has a 40 micron
filtration capability. The fuel is received by the HP pump and is
boosted to a nominal 1000 psi. The HP pump has pressure relief set at
1360 psi. The FMU meters the fuel and the excessive HP fuel is diverted
back into the LP supply. The FMU is controlled by signals from the EEC.
The fuel flow meter gives indication to the upper ECAM screen of real
time fuel flow in KG/H. The distribution valve filters the fuel and
splits the supply into ten separate outlets. The ten outlets supply fuel
to two fuel spray nozzles per outlet. The fuel spray nozzles have small
filters within them. This gives last chance filtration prior to fuel
atomisation.

Fuel System Operation Fuel Metering Unit Description A simplified
schematic representation of the Fuel Metering Unit is shown below. The
three main functions of the FMU are; • Metering the fuel supplies to the
fuel spray nozzles. • Overspeed protection for both the LP (N1) and HP
(2) rotors. • Isolation of fuel supplied for starting/stopping the
engine. Three valves arranged as follows carry out these three
functions; • The Fuel Metering Valve. • The Overspeed Valve. • The
Pressure Raising and Shut Off Valve (PRSOV). Fuel metering valve The
fuel metering valve varies the fuel flow according to the EEC command.
The positional feedback to the EEC is by a rotary variable displacement
transducer (RVDT). The overspeed valve The overspeed valve protects the
engine against an exceedance of; •
N1 shaft speed.
•
N2 shaft speed.
Revision 2
The feedback to the EEC of the valve operation is by a micro switch. The
pressure raising and shut of valve (PRSOV) The PRSOV is an open and
close type valve. The PRSOV controls the fuel to the combustor. When the
valve is in the pressure raising state it is said to be open. When the
valve is in the shut off state it is said to be closed. Note: The EEC
has command to open the PRSOV upon an engine start. The EEC has command
to close the PRSOV in auto start mode and when the N2 is below 50%.
Above 50% N2 the close command is from the master lever in the flight
deck only. Pressure drop governor and spill valve The pressure drop
governor controls the pressure difference across the FMV. The spill
valve is controlled by the pressure drop governor. The spill valve is
designed to vary the excessive HP fuel pressure return to the LP system.

Fuel System
Fuel System Operation Fuel metering Valve Operation Fuel metering is
achieved by the Fuel Metering Valve and the Pressure Drop Regulator and
Spill Valve, which act together in the following sequence: Signals from
the EEC cause the torque motor to change position, which directs fuel
servo pressure to re-position the Fuel Metering Valve. This changes the
size of the metering orifice through which the fuel passes which in turn
changes the pressure drop across the metering valve. The change in the
pressure drop is sensed by the Pressure Drop Regulator which will
re-position the spill valve and so increase/decrease the fuel flow
through the fuel metering valve until the pressure drop is restored to
its datum value. The increase/decrease in fuel flow causes the engine to
accelerate/decelerate until the actual EPR is that demanded by the EEC
signal. Movement of the Fuel Metering Valve is transmitted through a
rack and pinion mechanism to drive a dual output position resolver. The
resolver output is fed back to the EEC. The EEC automatically corrects
changes in fuel density. Bimetallic washers located in the pressure drop
governor and spill valve assembly provide automatic compensation for
changes in fuel temperature.

Fuel System Operation
Note:
FMU 'Emergency' Overspeed Protection
Because of the fact that the overspeed valve is spring loaded to the
closed position, and opened by fuel pressure, the overspeed valve will
close every time the engine is shut down.
The Overspeed Valve is positioned down stream, in series, with the Fuel
Metering Valve. Note: It should be understood that this device is not
incorporated to provide the usual N1/N2 red line limiting of max TO
speed of 100%.
The PRSOV will remain open due to the small amount of fuel that is
allowed to flow by the shutoff vale The microswitch gives valve
positional feedback to the EEC.
The EEC will act through the Fuel Metering Valve to trim the fuel flow
if N1 or N2 reach 100%. Operation The overspeed valve is spring loaded
to the closed position, it is opened by increasing fuel pressure during
engine start and during normal engine operation is always fully open. In
the event of an overspeed condition (&gt;109% N1 or &gt;105.7% N2 ) the EEC
sends a signal to the overspeed valve torque motor which changes
position and directs HP fuel to the top of the overspeed valve thus
fully closing the valve. A small by-pass flow is arranged around the
overspeed valve to prevent engine flame out. The overspeed valve is
hydraulically latched in the closed position, thus preventing the engine
from being accelerated. The recommended procedure is for the flight crew
to close the engine down, and not re-start. Closing down the engine is
the only way to release the hydraulic latching. Revision 2

Fuel System
Fuel System Operation Pressure Raising and Shut Off Valve Operation The
third valve in the FMU is the Pressure Raising and Shut Off Valve
(PRSOV).
The EEC's ability to close the shut off valve is inhibited above 50% N2.
Its primary function is to isolate the fuel supplies to the fuel spray
nozzles for starting and stopping the engine.
Above 50% N2, and in flight, the PRSOV can only be closed by the crew
operated switch in the flight deck.
It acts as a pressure raising valve to ensure that, during engine
starts, fuel is not passed to the fuel spray nozzles until fuel
pressures in the FMU are high enough to ensure the control devices will
function correctly.
The microswitch gives valve positional feedback.
The two position torque motor, which controls HP fuel pressure to
operate the PRSOV also, controls a spill valve servo line. When the
torque motor is selected to close the PRSOV, to shut down the engine,
the spill valve servo line is opened. This will fully open the spill
valve and direct all the HP fuel pump delivery back to the LP fuel
system. The PRSOV torque motor is commanded open by the EEC during AUTO
starts. It is commanded open by the engine master switch during a MANUAL
start. The PRSOV can be commanded closed by the EEC during an AUTO
start, if the EEC detects a fault in the start cycle.

© IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000
IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance
Engine Oil System
Engine Oil System Introduction Purpose
Scavenge
The oil system is a self contained, full flow recirculating type design
to ensure reliable lubrication and cooling under all circumstances.
The scavenge system is designed to retrieve the oil that is present in
the bearing chambers and gearbox for cooling and recirculation.
Description
There are six scavenge pumps that are designed to suck the oil and pass
it through:
Oil cooling is controlled by a dedicated Heat Management System which
ensure that engine oil, IDG oil and fuel temperatures are maintained at
acceptable levels while ensuring the optimum cooling configuration for
the best engine performance. The engine oil system can be divided into
three sections. These sections are: •
Pressure feed.
•
Scavenge.
•
Venting.
Pressure feed The pressure feed system uses the full flow generated by
the pressure pump. The pressure pump moves the oil through: •
The pressure filter.
•
Fuel oil heat exchanger.
The oil is then distributed to the engine bearings and gear drives.
Revision 2
•
Magnetic chip detectors.
•
A scavenge filter and master chip detector.
Prior to returning the oil back to the oil tank. Venting The venting
system is designed to allow the air and oil mix that develops in the
bearing chambers and gearbox to escape to the de oiler. No.4 bearing
does not have a scavenge pump. It relies upon the build up of air
pressure in the bearing chamber to force the air and oil through the
no.4 bearing scavenge valve and into the de oiler. Indications There are
flight deck indications that allow the oil system to be monitored. There
are also messages generated ECAM for further flight crew awareness.

No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve Purpose
High flow
Maintains the centre bearing compartment (No 4 bearing) seal deferential
pressure by controlling the venting of the compartment air/oil mixture
to the de oiler.
When the engine is at low power the valve is at the high flow position.
Location
Therefore the valve is fully open and the pressure differential is
maintained across the carbon seal.
The no.4 bearing scavenge valve is located on the front of the de oiler,
which is located on the front face of the external gearbox.
Low flow
Description The no.4 bearing scavenge valve has the following features;
Therefore the valve is at the restricted flow condition and the pressure
differential is maintained across the carbon seal.
• Operational feed back signal to EIU.
Note:
• Uses HPC10 air as the servo air for the valve operation.
High flow at high power will cause a lower seal differential pressure.
This will lead to the flow of buffer air across the carbon seal to
increase.
• Stage 10 air less than 150 psi the valve is at maximum open position.
• Stage 10 air more than 200 psi the valve is at minimum open position.
• Feedback to EIU of valve operation is the valve position indicator;
scavenge oil pressure sensor and Pb indication from the EEC.
When the engine is at high power the valve is at the low flow position.
The increase flow of buffer air leads to the carbon seal drying out. If
the valve is not in the correct position for the engine power setting,
the warning message "BEARING 4 OIL SYS" on the upper ECAM.
The no.4 bearing scavenge valve controls the flow of the scavenge oil
and vent air by varying the size of the orifice of the valve. This
allows the scavenge oil and vent air to enter the de oiler under
controlled conditions. Revision 2

79-00-00-601 It is recommended that records be kept of all debris found
on the MCD's and in the filters. The debris must be examined with a
binocular microscope of 20 times magnification. If the engine or
external gearbox is rejected, the debris from the MCD's and filters must
be sent with the component to the overhaul shop.
Metallic Flakes Metallic flakes come from these components: ball
bearings, roller bearings and gear teeth. Flakes that have an irregular
shape must be examined to find their origin. •
Ball bearing and ball bearing track flakes are usually almost circular
with radial cracks. When the flake is clean, the shiny side is much
brighter than other types of flake. The shiny side also has small
scratches that go across each other.
•
This is unwanted material that is accidentally left in the engine when
it is assembled. The build debris comes from machining operations when
the components are manufactured. When the material is broken it can look
the same as gear or steel seal material.
Roller bearing and roller bearing track flakes are usually almost
rectangular in shape. When the flake is clean, the shiny side is much
brighter than other types of flake. The shiny side has small scratches
that go across each other.
•
Gear teeth flakes are shiny with an irregular shape. They are usually
thicker and not as bright as ball or roller bearing flakes.
Magnetic Fines
Chips
These are very small steel particles, which show as a black sludge on
the MCD's. When the oil is removed they show as dull hair like slivers.
Fines come from permitted engine wear. Bearing skid can also make fines,
but the increased quantity will show during the analysis of MCD samples.
These are very thick flakes or pieces of metal, which usually have one
smooth machined surface.
There are four main types of debris found on MCD's and in filters. They
are build debris, magnetic fines, metallic flakes and chips and gear
tooth fragments. Build Debris
Revision 2
Gear Tooth Fragments These are the corner pieces of gear teeth and may
show that the gears are not correctly aligned.

IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance
Heat Management System
Heat Management System Purpose The system is designed to provide
adequate cooling, to maintain the critical oil and fuel temperatures
within specified limits, whilst minimising the requirement for the fan
air offtake. Location The following units are located about the engine
fan case; • The engine FCOC. • The engine ACOC. • The IDG FCOC. • The
fuel diverter and back to tank valve. • The aircraft outer wing fuel
tanks. Description Three sources of cooling are available: • The LP fuel
passing to the engine fuel system. • The LP fuel that is returned to the
aircraft fuel tanks.
There are four basic configurations between which the flow paths of fuel
in the engine LP fuel system are varied. The configurations are; •
Mode 1. • Mode 3. • Mode 4. • Mode 5. Within each configuration the
cooling capacity may be varied by control valves that form the fuel
diverter and back to tank valve. The transfer between modes of operation
is determined by software logic contained in the EEC. The logic is
generated around the limiting temperatures of the fuel and oil within
the system together with the signal from the aircraft that
permits/inhibits fuel spill to aircraft tanks.
• Fan air.

Heat Management System
Air/Oil Heat Exchanger Air Modulating Valve Purpose To govern the flow
of cooling (fan) air through the air/oil heat exchanger, as commanded by
the EEC heat management control system.
The valve is operated via signals from the EEC heat management system.
Location
The electro-hydraulic servo valve directs a controlling fuel pressure to
the operating piston.
The air/oil heat exchanger (ACOC) is attached to the right hand side of
the engine fan case.
Depending on which side of the piston the fluid is present depends
whether the valve opens or closes.
It is in the four o'clock position as viewed from the rear of the engine
looking forwards.
An LVDT gives positional feedback to the EEC of the valves position.
Description The ACOC is a plate type heat exchanger. It is operated by
an electro hydraulic servo valve mechanism. The following are features
of the ACOC; • Fail safe position is valve open for maximum cooling. •
Fire seal forms an air tight seal between the unit outlet and the
cowling orifices. • Control by either channel A or B of EEC. • Valve
position feed back signal via LVDT to each channel of EEC. • Valve
positioned by fuel servo pressure acting on a control piston. • Fuel
servo pressure directed by the electro hydraulic servo valve assembly
which incorporates a torque motor. Revision 2

Fuel Diverter and Back to Tank Valve Purpose The fuel diverter valve and
the back to tank valve together form a single unit. Command signals of
the EEC control the two valves. The two valves in turn manage the flow
of high pressure fuel. This is done to optimise the heat exchange
process that takes place between the fuel and oil. Location The unit is
bolted to the rear of the fuel/oil heat exchanger. Description Fuel
Diverter Valve This valve is a two position valve and is operated by a
dual coil solenoid. The control signals to energise/de-energise the
solenoid come from the EEC • Solenoid energised - mode 1 or 3. •
Solenoid de-energised (fail safe position) mode 4 or 5. Back to Tank
Valve This valve is a modulating valve and will divert a proportion of
the LP fuel back to the aircraft tanks as controlled by the EEC. The
interface between the EEC and the valve is a modulating torque motor;
the torque motor will direct HP servo fuel to position the valve. • Fail
safe position is with the valve fully closed - no fuel return to tank.

Compressor Airflow Control
Compressor Airflow Control System Introduction Description/operation The
engine incorporates two air bleed systems and a variable stator vane
(V.S.V.) system, which together are used to: •
Ensure stable airflow through the compressor at "off design" conditions.
•
Ensure smooth, surge free, accelerations decelerations (transient
conditions).
•
Improve engine-starting characteristics.
•
In re-stabilising the engine if surge occurs (surge recovery).
and
The complete system comprises three sub-systems, which are: •
An L.P. compressor air bleed located at engine station 2.5 and known as
the Booster Stage Bleed Valve (B.S.B.V.)
•
H.P. compressor air bleeds on stages 7 and 10.
•
The V.S.V. system which comprises variable inlet guide vanes, at the
inlet to the H.P. compressor, and 4 stages of variable stator vanes on
the A1 and 3 stages on A5 engines.
The EEC controls all three systems A schematic overview of the complete
airflow control system is shown below. Revision 2

L.P. Compressor Bleed Valve (LPCBV) - A5 Purpose
LPCBV Mechanical Arrangement
The LPCBV bleeds air from the rear of the L.P. compressor at engine
station 2.5, the bleed air is vented into the fan air duct.
The L.P. Compressor Bleed Valve is a continuous ring type valve that
rotates and slides forward to open and rearward to close. Ten support
arms support the ring. Two of the support arms are driven via a lever
and actuating rod by both the LPCBV master actuator and the slave
actuator.
The bleed valve provides improved an improved surge margin during
starting, low power and transient operations. The bleed valve is
controlled by the EEC and is fully modulating, between the fully open
and fully closed positions this is a function of: •
N1 corrected speed
•
Altitude
•
Aircraft forward speed (Mach Number)
The two actuators utilise H.P. fuel pressure (from the FMU) as the
hydraulic medium and are hydraulically linked to ensure simultaneous
movement. The master actuator interfaces with the EEC via a torque motor
control and LVDT feedback. The mechanical linkage is shown below.
For starting the bleed valve is fully open and will progressively close
during engine acceleration, during cruise and take off the valve is
fully closed. For decelerations and engine operation in reverse thrust
the valve is opened. In the event of an engine surge the valve is opened
to enhance recovery.

fully closed. For decelerations and engine operation in reverse thrust
the valve is opened. In the event of an engine surge the valve is opened
to enhance recovery.

Booster Stage Bleed Valve Component Description Actuators The two
B.S.B.V. actuators utilise H.P. fuel as a hydraulic operating medium.
The actuators are located on the rear of the intermediate casing on
either side of the H.P. compressor, as shown below. Only one of the
actuators, the one on the left hand side, interfaces with the EEC This
actuator is called the Master actuator, the right hand side actuator is
called the Slave actuator. The two actuators are hydraulically linked by
two tubes, which pass across the top of the H.P. compressor case. The
master actuator incorporates a Linear Variable Differential Transducer
(L.V.D.T.) which transmits actuator positional information back to the
EEC The slave actuator incorporates two overload relief valves, which
prevent overpressurisation of the actuators in the case of faults, such
as a mechanically seized actuator.

Compressor Airflow Control
Variable Stator Vane System (VSV) A1 Introduction Variable Incidence
Stator Vanes control the entry of air into the H.P. compressor. The
variable vanes control the angle at which the air enters the first five
stages of the H.P. compressor.
The actuator incorporates an LVDT which signals actuator positional
information back to the EEC.
The angle varies with the H.P. compressor speed (N2); this reduces the
risk of blade stall and compressor surge. The five stages of variable
incidence stators comprise inlet guide vanes to stage 3 and stages 3, 4,
5 and 6 stator vanes. Mechanical Arrangement Each vane has pivots at its
inner and outer ends, which allow the vane to rotate about its
longitudinal axis. The outer end of each vane is formed into a shaft
which passes through the compressor case and is attached by a short
lever to a 'unison ring', (one unison ring for each stage). Short rods
to a crankshaft connect the five unison rings. A short rod to an
actuator that utilises H.P. fuel as a hydraulic operating medium
connects the crankshaft. Signals from the EEC direct H.P. fuel to
extend/retract the actuator. Actuator movement causes the crankshaft to
rotate, and, through the unison rings, reposition the variable stator
vanes.

Variable Stator Vane System (V.S.V.) Actuator Removal/Installation Prior
to VSV actuator removal, it is necessary to drain the fuel lines to the
actuator. The fuel lines are drained at the union locations shown below.
Fuel is drained at this point because it is the lowest point in the
system and also because fuel drained here is less likely to cause
contamination of the engine electrical harness.

is in Chapter 75-32-41 of the engine maintenance manual but is
summarised below. •
After refitting the unit, rig pin the actuator piston in the high speed

Note: This is achieved by moving the ram to the fully retracted position
against the high speed stop, then withdrawing the ram as necessary to
align the rig pin hole in the fork end with the hole in the rig pin
housing (Detail B). •
Rig pin the VSV crankshaft in the high speed position.
•
Connect the rod adjusting its length to suit (it has a left and right
hand threads -- 'turnbuckle effect'). Ensure control rod ends are in
'safety' on completion.
•
Remove rig pins.
•
Upon completion carry out Test 3 or 1 leak checks, followed by Test No

Handling Bleed Valves Introduction Handling bleed valves are fitted to
the H.P. compressor to improve engine starting, and prevent engine surge
when the compressor is operating at off-design conditions. A total of
four bleed valves are used, three on stage 7 and one on stage 10. The
handling bleed valves are 'two position' only - fully open or fully
closed, and are operated pneumatically by their respective solenoid
control valve. The solenoid control valves are scheduled by the EEC as a
function of N2 and T2.6 (N2 corrected). When the bleed valves are open,
H.P. compressor air bleeds into the fan duct through ports in the inner
barrel of the 'C' ducts. The servo air used to operate the bleed valves
is H.P. compressor delivery air known as P3 or Pb. The bleed valves are
arranged radially around the H.P. compressor case as shown below.
Silencers are used on some bleed valves. All the bleed valves are spring
loaded to the open position and as a result will always be in the
correct position (open) for starting.

Handling Bleed Valves - Operating Schedule The handling bleed valves
have three operating regimes: •
Steady State.
•
Transient - Acceleration/Deceleration.
•
Surge/Reverse
Operation of the bleed valve is scheduled against N2 corrected for
changes of H.P. compressor (T2.6) inlet temperature - known as N2C26.
Steady State The valves are commanded 'open' whenever N2C26 is below the
steady state closing speed. Transient The valves are commanded 'open' at
the beginning of accelerations/decelerations and will 'close' when
either the speed limits are exceeded or timers expire. After an
acceleration phase has ceased, the valve will remain open until a period
of 5 seconds have elapsed, after which it will then be signalled to
close. During a deceleration phase the valve will remain open until a
period of 62 seconds have elapsed after the engine has stabilised at the
new engine speed. Surge/Reverse The valves will be commanded open in the
event of a surge. In reverse thrust laws similar to the transient laws
apply. Revision 2

Handling Bleed Valves - Operation The bleed valves and the solenoid
control valves all operate in the same manner. The operation of one
bleed valve only is described. Bleed Valves The bleed valve is a
two-position valve and is either fully open or fully closed. The bleed
valve is spring loaded to the open position and so all the bleed valves
will be in the correct position - open - for engine start. When the
engine is started the bleed air will try to close the valve. The valve
is kept in the open position by servo air (P3) supplied from the
solenoid control valve, (solenoid de-energised) as shown below.

Handling Bleed Valves Operation The EEC will close the bleed valves at
the correct time during acceleration. The bleed valve is closed by the
EEC, which energises the solenoid control valve, as shown below.
Energising the solenoid control valve vents the P3 servo air from the
opening chamber of the bleed valve, and the valve will move to the
closed position. During an engine deceleration the reverse operation
occurs and the bleed valve opens.

Handling Bleed Valves -- Troubleshooting. The HP Compressor rotor path
lining is designed to be worn away by the rotor blades of the
compressor.
All bleed valves (3 off stage 7, 1 off stage 10) are spring loaded to
the 'open' position for engine starting.
As air is expelled through the bleed valves during their normal
operation, some of the debris from the rotor path lining contaminates
the valve seals.
They are held open during engine running, by solenoid valve directed P3
air. According to schedule requirements, the bleed valves will close
progressively during the starting cycle in the sequence 7B, 10, and 7C.
If this lining becomes lodged in the carbon seals within the bleed valve
then there is the possibility that this will prevent the valve from
operating smoothly and the valve will seize.
The 7A valve stays open up to and above idle.
If the valve does not operate when required, the engine will experience
problems at critical points. Handling Bleed consequences: •

Hung Start:
If the bleed valve sticks in the closed condition, (Nondetected FADEC
fault) or the solenoid valve sticking in the 'energised position
(Non-detected FADEC fault) the engine will experience difficulty in
starting 'hung start or surge' during the start cycle. This is due to
the fact that during low engine speeds, the bleed valve system is
designed to effectively 'dump' into the 'C' duct a large amount of the
air supplied to the HP Compressor. This is necessary because of the HP
Compressor's inability to handle all the mass flow of air being supplied
to it by the LP Compressor during low speed operation.

Engine Parameter shift/mismatch during climb/cruise
Handling Bleed Valves -- Troubleshooting Continued:
Engine Parameter shifts due to an open bleed valve that are not noticed
at engine start are more likely to become evident at higher EPR power
settings.
If a bleed valve fails to close when required to do so, under certain
conditions the engine may exceed the recommended EGT operating limits
thus preventing the aircraft from taking off.
This increases the Exceedance/Overlimit.
likelihood
of
an
EGT
This will be caused as a result of the EEC trying to achieve Take-off
EPR but with a reduced volume of air being supplied to the combustion
chamber for mixing with fuel, ignition and subsequent expansion.
Additionally, an open bleed valve as a result of bleed valve system
problems will also result in unexplained engine parameter shifts.
Therefore the EEC makes up for the shortfall in the available volume of
air and simply demands the FMU to provide more fuel to compensate.
•
Bleed valve(s) stuck open (Non-detected FADEC fault).
•
Solenoid valve sticking in the de-energised position (Non-detected FADEC
fault).
•
An electrical failure of the solenoid valve which results in the
solenoid moving to the de-energised position (FADEC fault).
The resultant 'over-fuelling' provides the required EPR, but with the
penalty of increased EGT. TSM Supporting data 75-00-00-301 (Bleed Valve
Troubleshooting Hints) give comprehensive recommendations in the
diagnosis of bleed valve related problems.
Possible causes:
Rigorous troubleshooting would reduce large number of NFF cases. The
lubrication of bleed valves should not be carried out.

•
Bleed valves closing early can be due to the solenoid sticking such that
the full de-energised position is not obtained (Non-detected FADEC
fault), bleed valve internal seal wear and leakage of P3 servo air.
During transient manoeuvres (acceleration/deceleration) and surge
recovery, HP compressor stability is maintained by opening particular
bleed valves as defined by the EEC logic. For transient manoeuvres on
the ground, the 7C are opened and during flight both the 7A and 7C are
opened. In both cases the 7C are opened based upon a transient detect
and is closed after a set period of time has elapsed. There are no
valves opened at take-off power or steady state cruise. For surge
recovery, the 7A, 7C and 10 stage bleed valves are opened to maintain
compressor stability. Possible causes Engine problems (stall/surge) on
transient operation can be the result of: •
Bleed valve(s) not being opened during the transient
(acceleration/deceleration)
•
Bleed valve closing early.
•
Bleed valves not being open can be due to the bleed valve sticking in
the closed position (Non-detected FADEC fault), or the solenoid sticking
in the energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault).

Engine Secondary Air systems Introduction Purpose The secondary air
systems serve the function of the engine and aircraft.
The valve position is controlled by the EEC as a function of corrected
N2 and altitude.
Description
Aircraft Services Air Offtake System
The secondary air system is made up of the following:
The engine supplies the aircraft with bleed air taken from HPC stages 7
and 10.
• Active clearance control system (ACC). • 10th stage make up air
system.
The air that is taken from the engine is used for the following:
• Aircraft services bleed system.
• Cabin pressurisation and conditioning.
• Air cooled air cooler (ACAC) for the no.4 bearing cooling and sealing.
• Wing anti icing.
Active Clearance Control (ACC) The system improves engine performance by
ensuring that the HPT and LPT operate with optimum turbine blade tip
clearances. This is achieved by directing a controlled flow of cooling
air to reduce the thermal growth of the turbine casings. This minimises
the increase in turbine blade tip clearances which otherwise occurs
during the climb and cruise phases.
• Engine cross feed starting. • Hydraulic system pressurisation. • Water
system pressurisation. The required air is bled from the HPC of each
engine. Air cooled air cooler (ACAC) HPC12 air is used for cooling and
sealing the no.4 bearing in the centre bearing compartment.
10th Stage Make Up Air System
The ACAC pre cools the HPC12 air prior to the air being passed to the
centre bearing compartment.
The purpose of this system is to provide additional cooling airflow to
the HPT stage 2 disc and blades.
The cooled HPC12 air is commonly known as buffer air.
The cooling air used is taken from the 10th stage manifold and is
controlled by a two position pneumatically operated valve. Revision 2
The ACAC uses fan bypass air as the cooling medium.

system is mainly located about the core engine.
The operating actuator moves in a linear motion by the influence of fuel
pressure. The EEC receives feedback of the actuator position by an LVDT.
The operating actuator moves a linkage that controls the valves in the
modulating air control unit for the LPT and HPT case cooling. The HPT
and LPT casings are cooled by fan bypass air that is ducted from the fan
bypass. Failsafe Position
The ACC system consists of the following items:
Upon the event of fuel pressure loss and/or EEC power failure the ACC
modulating air control valves will adopt the following positions;
• LPT and HPT cooling manifolds.
• LPT is --44% open.
• Operating actuator with LVDT feedback.
• HPT is closed.
Description
• Modulating air control valve unit. • EEC control. • Fan bypass air
cooling medium. The EEC controls the ACC system by monitoring the
following parameters: • Corrected N2. • Aircraft altitude. From these
two parameters the EEC will signal the operating actuator. Revision 2

Purpose
The ACC actuator provides the movement to the modulating air valves so

casing.
Description
Description
The ACC actuator consists of the following:
The modulating air control valve has two separate valves. They are:
• Linear motion two directional piston. • Dual track LVDT. • Electro
hydraulic torque motor. • Filter. The ACC actuator receives signals from
the EEC. The torque motor will direct high pressure fuel to one of the
two sides of the piston. This is dependent on the EEC command signal.
• HPT valve. • LPT valve. The two valves are designed to operate to
allow the optimum airflow to the respective casings. The failsafe
position is: • HPT is closed. • LPT is --44% open.
Piston movement will result in a movement in the push pull rod that
links the ACC actuator and the modulating air valve. The LVDT will
feedback the piston position to the EEC. At engine shut down or nil
servo pressure the ACC actuator will assume the failsafe position. A
spring in the ACC actuator will force the piston to the failsafe
position. Revision 2

The EEC controls the opening and closing of the ACC system by monitoring
input signals of; • Corrected N2. • Altitude. The EEC commands an input
signal to the torque motor. The torque motor positions the jet pipe
servo valve.
Position A At position A the engine is shut down. This is also the
failsafe position. HPT ACC valve is closed. LPT ACC valve is at --44%.
The torque motor can deflect the jet pipe servo valve to bias the
direction of flow of the servo fuel pressure.
Position B
The jet pipe servo valve controls the direction of flow of servo fuel
pressure to effectively move the pilot valve.
HPT ACC is closed.
The pilot valve moves and admits servo fuel pressure to either side of
the piston. Servo fuel pressure will act on one side of the piston at
any one time when a movement is required.
This position represents idling conditions. LPT ACC is closed. Position
C This position represents a typical take off condition. This position
is altitude dependent.
The movement of the piston moves a push pull rod that in turn operates
the modulating air control valve.
HPT ACC is starting to open.
When stabilisation of the piston is required the EEC will cancel the
input signal to the torque motor.
Position D and E
This allows the jet pipe to return to the central position and as a
result of this the pilot valve will move into the equilibrium position.
Servo fuel pressure is now present on both sides of the pilot valve. The
spring will bias the pilot valve position by forcing it to one side.
LPT ACC is at 70%. These positions represent typically cruise and top of
descent conditions. This position is altitude dependent. HPT ACC at D is
30% and at E is fully open. LPT ACC is fully open at points D and E.
The dual track LVDTs will send feedback signals to the EEC of the ACC
system operation. Revision 2

10th Stage Make Up Air System Purpose The 10th stage make up air valve
system allows additional cooling air to the HPT stage 2 disc and blades.
The microswitch gives a positional feedback signal to the EEC indicating
of either:
Description
• Valve open.
The 10th stage make up air valve system consists of the following
components:
• Valve closed.
• EEC control.
The valve is open for all conditions of flight/engine operation except
for cruise.
• Make up valve control solenoid.
In cruise the valve is closed.
• Two position type on/off valve. • Microswitch positional feedback. The
EEC uses input signals of: • Corrected N2. • Altitude. The EEC to signal
the control solenoid to operate uses these inputs. The control solenoid
manages the flow of P3 (HPC stage 12) air for the pneumatic operating
medium. The two position make up air valve either opens to flow stage 10
air or closes for no flow. The solenoid is de energised when the valve
is in the open position. This is the fail safe position.

Purpose
Purpose
The 10th stage make up valve purpose is to supply air to supplement the
normal airflows around the no.4 bearing housing and the HPT disc and
blades.
The control solenoid valve purpose is to manage the flow of servo air
pressure to the make up air valve.
Location
The control solenoid is located on the right hand side of the fan case
approximately in the 4 o'clock position.
th
The 10 stage make up air valve is located at the top of the HPC casing.
Description The 10th stage make up air valve consists of the following
components: • Operating piston. • Microswitch feedback.
Location
Description The control solenoid consists of the following components:
Solenoid pack. Pilot valve. Valve body.
• Valve body.
The solenoid control valve will direct the flow of servo air pressure to
port when it is de-energised.
The valve is a two positional type. It can either allow flow HPC stage
10 air or cut it off from the engine. There is no modulation.
The solenoid control valve will direct the flow of servo air pressure to
the make up valve when it is energised.
The operating piston is spring loaded to the open position when servo
air is not present in the piston chamber. Servo air is used to close the
valve. The micro switch gives positional feedback of the piston position
hence the valves condition. The fail safe position is valve open.

10TH Stage Make Up Air System Operation The operation of the system is
as follows: The EEC constantly monitors: • Corrected N2. • Pressure
altitude. The make up air valve will be commanded to open during all
flight conditions except during cruise. To Energise the Solenoid Valve
The solenoid pack attracts the cover plate A towards it thus opening up
the chamber that is at the spring side of the pilot valve. The servo air
pressure and spring pressure at the spring end of the pilot valve
overcomes the servo air pressure alone on the opposite side of the pilot
valve. This makes the pilot valve move towards the cover plate B. Cover
plate B is pushed away from the orifice allowing servo air to enter the
make up valve. The servo air enters the make up valve piston chamber in
the opposite side to the spring side. The servo air pressure overcomes
the spring pressure and forces the piston to move and hence close the
valve. The microswitch contacts are broken and a feedback signal is fed
to the EEC.

Engine Secondary Air Systems
To De-Energise the Solenoid Valve The solenoid pack is de-energised. The
cover plate A is force away from the solenoid pack by spring pressure
and forced against the orifice. This prevents servo air from entering
the spring side of the pilot valve. Servo air pressure on the opposite
side of the pilot valve now forces this valve against the spring. As the
pilot valve moves cover plate B closes off the orifice. This prevents
servo air pressure from entering the make up valve piston chamber. The
spring affecting the piston valve forces the piston to move and open the
make up valve orifice. The microswitch contacts are made and a feedback
signal is fed to the EEC. Fail Safe Position The fail safe position has
the valve in the open position hence solenoid de-energised. This is also
true if a power loss is experienced or a loss of servo air pressure.

Aircraft Services Air Offtake System Purpose To provide the following
aircraft systems with engine ducted air supply:
The over pressurisation valve (OPV) protects the system against
excessive pressures.
• Cabin pressurisation and conditioning.
The precooler prepares the bleed air to an acceptable temperature before
it enters the environmental control system (ECS).
• Wing leading edge anti icing. • Engine cross bleed starting. •
Hydraulic system pressurisation. Location The bleed air offtakes are
taken from: • HPC stage 7 for high power conditions. • HPC stage 10 for
low power conditions. Description HPC air is taken from the engine and
ducted towards the aircraft services.
The pre cooler utilises fan bypass air to cool the HPC bleed air. The
temperature limiting thermostat (TLT) controls the PRV when an over
temperature has been experienced. The temperature controlling thermostat
(TCT) controls the pre cooler valve but if bleed temperature cannot be
maintained the temperature limiting thermostat will signal for the PRV
to close. The bleed monitoring computer controls the functions of bleed
air system making the system fully automatic.
The HPC stage 7 offtake has a non return valve installed before the two
offtakes join. The NRV protects against HPC stage 10 air from reverse
flowing back into the HPC stage 7 of the engine. The HPC stage 10
offtake has a control valve called the high pressure valve (HPV). After
the two offtakes come together as one there is a pressure regulating
valve (PRV). A switch located in the flight deck controls the PRV.

The OPV will reopen at 35 psi. (Depending on mod standard 20 - 57 psi)
• Fan air valve (FAV).
Temperature limiting thermostat (TLT)
• High pressure valve (HPV).
The TLT will start to close the PRV to reduce pressure at 235 deg.c.
The bleed monitoring computer monitors the following: • Temperature
limiting thermostat (TLT). • Temperature controlling thermostat (TCT).
Over pressure valve (OPV)
The TLT over temperature is 247 deg.c. Above this value will reduce PRV
pressure to 17.5 psi.
• Pressure sensor downstream of the HPV.
The TLT maximum temperature is 257 +/- 3 deg.c. (60 sec delay) Above
this value and the PRV is closed.
• Pressure sensor downstream of the PRV.
Temperature controlling thermostat (TCT)
The selection of HPC stage 7 (also called IP bleed air) or HPC stage 10
is automatically done by the BMC.
TCT will regulate the temperature of the air entering the aircraft
system to 200 +/- 15 deg.c. The TCT controls the opening/closing of the
Fan air valve to regulate the fan airflow through the Pre -- cooler.
High pressure valve (HPV) The HPV will regulate HPC stage 10 air to
36+/- 3 psi. The HPV will close if upstream pressure is greater than 100
+/- 5 psi and/or downstream HPC stage 7 greater than 36 +/- 3 psi.
The pressure sensors feedback pressure signals to the BMC.
Pressure regulating valve (PRV) The PRV is spring loaded closed when
there is no pneumatic air available. Revision 2

Air Cooled Air Cooler (ACAC) Purpose The ACAC purpose is to pre cool
HPC12 air. The ACAC uses fan bypass air as the cooling medium.
The cooled HPC12 (buffer) air enters the cooling jacket of the centre
bearing chamber.
Location
The buffer air protects the no.4 bearing from excessive heat exposure.
The ACAC is located on the turbine casing. Bottom left hand side in the
5 o'clock position. Description The ACAC is a fin and tube type design.
The fan bypass airflow that is utilised by the ACAC extracts heat from
the HPC12 air. The HPC12 air is taken off the engine through a singular
tube.
The buffer air enters the bearing compartment to prevent oil loss. This
also pressurises the bearing chamber to allow the oil and air mix to
leave the bearing chamber and enter the de oiler. The centre bearing
compartment does not have oil scavenge pump.
The HPC12 air enters the ACAC and the heat exchange process takes place
between the fan bypass air and the hot HPC12 air. The fan bypass air is
ejected to atmosphere. The cooled HPC12 air leaves the ACAC and is
distributed to the centre bearing compartment through three tubes. The
tubes enter the diffuser casing in three positions. They are: •
12 o'clock.
•
3 o'clock.
•
9 o'clock.

Engine Ice Protection System
Engine Ice Protection System Introduction Purpose Ice may form in the
inlet cowl when the engine is operating in conditions of low temperature
and high humidity. Ice build about the inlet cowl leading edge could
affect engine performance and could cause engine damage from ice
ingestion.
The distribution manifold will allow hot air to enter the inlet cowl
leading edge. The excessive air is ejected overboard via an outlet
located on the right hand side of the inlet cowl. Fault indications for
the ice protection system are as follows:
To prevent ice formation ice protection systems have been incorporated
into the engine.
The flight deck anti icing selector switch illuminates.
The inlet cowl leading edge is thermally ice protected.
P2/T2 probe heater
The P2/T2 probe mounted in the inlet cowl is thermally ice protected.
The P2/T2 probe is continuously heated during engine operation by an
integral 115V heating coil.
The spinner of the fan module is ice protected by a flexible rubber tip.
Spinner
An ECAM warning message is generated.
The engine ice protection system description is as follows:
A solid rubber nose tip that vibrates naturally to break up and dislodge
the ice immediately it starts to form protects the spinner against ice
build up.
Inlet cowl ice protection
Ground running
The inlet cowl is thermally heated to prevent ice formation at the
leading edge of the intake lip.
Icing conditions may occur when temperature (OAT) is less than:
The ice protection system for the inlet cowl is controlled from the
flight deck by a selector switch. The switch will control the opening
and closing of the TAI valve.
5.5 deg.c (42 deg.f).
The valve will allow the airflow taken from the HPC stage 7 to flow to
the distribution manifold in the inlet cowl leading edge lip.
If the above conditions exist the ice protection system must be operated
as soon as the engine stabilises at low idle conditions after an engine
start.

The control solenoid is energised.
The valve has provision for being secured in either the;
The ball valve of the control solenoid is hard against the ambient vent
outlet. This prevents upstream air from escaping to vent.
• Locked position.
The pressure acting on the piston at position area A is greater than the
pressure acting on position area B. This along with spring pressure
holds the butterfly valve in the closed position.
• Open position. This requirement is necessary when a valve has failed.
The MMEL will advise of the actions required to allow despatch of the
aircraft.
Valve open The control solenoid is de energised. The ball valve is no
longer held by the control solenoid against the ambient vent. The ball
valve moves by spring pressure against the orifice, which allows
upstream air to enter area A. This now prevents air passage to area A of
the piston. The air pressure now remains at piston area B only. This
pressure is greater than the spring pressure alone therefor the piston
moves against the spring pressure. The resultant movement opens the
butterfly valve and allows HPC stage 7 air to flow towards the TAI
manifold. Fail safe position The fail safe position is as follows: •
Solenoid de energised. • Servo air pressure at piston area B only. •
Butterfly valve in the open position. Revision 2

ECAM Indications The engine anti icing valve has a micro switch, which
will feedback the valve position in relation to the selector switch
position.
The message is status related it therefore becomes a despatch critical
message. Advice from the MMEL is required.
When the anti icing system is functioning normally a caption will
appear:
Note:
• ENG A. ICE
It is advisable not to lock the TAI valve in the open position for the
higher thrust engines.
The caption appears on the upper ECAM lower right hand side.
If the valve fails in the closed position it is advisable to avoid icing
conditions.
The selector switch will have the on indicator illuminating in the
colour of blue.
If the valve fails in the open position there will be a thrust limit
penalty.
If a disagreement exists between the selector switch and the microswitch
output signal to the EEC a fault has been detected. The fault detection
occurs when one of the following situations exists:
One or both may be inoperative provided the valve has failed in the open
position and the performance penalties are applied and OAT does not
exceed ISA +35 deg.c.
• A valve failure to open.
For ER operations only one valve allowed to be failed in the closed
position and providing the aircraft is not operating in icing
conditions.
• A valve failure to close. The fault portion of the selector switch
will illuminate in the colour of amber when a disagreement exists. Th
upper ECAM screen will display a WARNING and STATUS message of: • ENG
1(2) VALVE CLSD.
Engine anti ice valve fault:
Engine anti ice fault light: One or both valves may be inoperative
provided the faulty valve is deactivated and considered inoperative in
the open position.
• ENG 1(2) VALVE OPEN. These messages relate to the switch position and
the intended valve position. The messages are engine specific. Revision

Ice Protection System Maintenance A failure of an anti icing valve to
either open or close when commanded to do so by the flight deck selector
switches, allows the engineer to override the valve in the open or
closed position. The manifold off-take from the engine is mounted on the
core engine and works its way towards the right hand side of the fan
casing. At the fan casing an anti ice valve is located. There is a
connection between the fan casing manifolds and the air intake
manifolds. The air intake manifolds allows the HPC stage 7 air to flow
into a distribution manifold. Excess air then under its own pressure is
ejected to atmosphere from an outlet grid found on the right hand side
of the intake cowl. The maintenance items that are to be discussed in
this section are: • TAI valve manual override; Deactivation AMM ref.

FADEC/Aircraft Interface Introduction Purpose The FADEC system supplies
the aircraft systems with the relevant engine data in order to assist
the aircraft to carry out its functions. Description The aircraft
systems that it uses to interpret the engine data and display it for
flight crew use is: • Electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM)
system. • Flight warning computer (FWC). • Data management computer
(DMC). • System data acquisition concentrator (SDAC). • Engine interface
unit (EIU). The ECAM system receives engine and aircraft data and
displays this on two cathode ray tubes (CRTs). The ECAM system is
designed to give the flight crew primary and secondary engine/aircraft
data. The flight warning system monitors all data that relates to a
class ONE indication. This is regarded as the highest priority type
annunciation. The system display can be transferred to the navigation
display (ND) CRT by a selector switch.

Shaft Speed Indicating System Purpose The speed indicating system
provides signals of: • N1 shaft speed. • N2 shaft speed.
Hence if the phonic wheel has 60 teeth then 60 pulses represents a
complete revolution of the N1 shaft. N2 System
The indications are used for:
The N2 indication is supplied by a dual output signal from channel B of
the dedicated generator.
• The ECAM CRT display.
• An output goes to the channel B side of the EEC.
• EEC control.
• An output goes to the EVMU.
A dedicated signal is used for trim balancing purposes. Location
Fan Trim Balance
The N1 speed sensors are located in the front bearing chamber mounted on
the no.2 bearing support.
The fan trim balance probe is located in the same place as the speed
pulse probes. This probe supplies a dedicated signal for monitoring of
LP system unbalance.
The N2 speed indication is the output signals from the dedicated
generator.
The probe is also different from the speed probes. It cannot be utilised
to give N1 speed indication.
Description
The pulse probe monitors a datum tooth of the phonic wheel. This tooth
is in line with the no.1 fan blade.
The speed indicating description is as follows: N1 System Three pulse
probes supply the N1 indication. The pulse probes operate by monitoring
the passage of a phonic wheel. The phonic wheel passage across the pulse
probe generates an output signal relative to a percentage of a
revolution.

N1Speed Indicating System Operation The probes comprise of two pole
pieces, a permanent magnet, and a coil wound on to one of the pole
pieces. The pole pieces span two teeth of the phonic wheel. The phonic
wheel is an integral part of the fan stub-shaft and has 60 teeth. As the
shaft rotates and the teeth of the phonic wheel pass the pole pieces and
a voltage pulse is produced in the winding. The number of pulses
produced is directly proportional to the speed of the shaft. This signal
is passed to the EEC and is used to display N1 speed on the flight deck
and also for the engine control circuits as required. Trim Balance Probe
The signal from this probe is only used during trim balance operations
and provides the phase relationship between any out of balance forces
present and a datum position. The trim balance probe senses the passage
of one specially modified tooth on the phonic wheel and produces one
pulse per revolution.

struts of the turbine exhaust case (engine station 4.9).
• The indication becomes red.
The 4 thermocouples are connected to the junction box by a thermocouple
harness. The materials used for the thermocouples and harnesses are:
The following message appears on the ECAM upper CRT:
• Chromel (CR).
• The MASTER WARN light comes on, accompanied by the repetitive audible
chime. EGT OVERLIMIT • The maximum value reached is memorised.
• Alumel (AL).
• A small red line remains positioned on the analogue scale at that
value (max pointer).
An extension harness connects the EGT junction box to channels A and B
of the EEC.
Note: The small and large nuts that secure the EGT leads to the junction
box must torque check and tightened during the A check until further
notice.(ref SB 77-0009) Single and dual channel failures have occurred
due to loose EGT securing nuts.

Description
Maximum continuous thrust mode (MCT).
The engine pressure ratio (EPR) is used to set and control the engine
thrust EPR. EPR is:
Climb mode (CLB).
P4.9 P2 The P2/T2 Probe measures P2. A pressure rake measures P4.9.
Flex TO Temperature is an assumed temperature entered by the flight crew
through the MCDU to the FMS facility. EPR reference is the predicted EPR
value according to TRA.
The pressures from these sensors are routed to the EEC. The EEC
processes the pressure signals to form actual EPR and transmits the EPR
value to the ECAM for display on the upper screen. Each of the two EEC
channels carries out this operation independently.

Description
Description
The P4.9 pressure rakes send a pressure signal down a common tube to a
transducer within the EEC.
The temperature is measured by two platinum resistance elements. Each
channel of the EEC monitors one of the elements. The pressure signal is
fed to a pressure transducer in the EEC. The sensor is electrically
heated to provide anti ice protection. The EEC software corrects any
temperature signal errors caused by heating. Note: The probe anti icing
heater utilises 115V AC from the aircraft electrical system. Higher
thrust engines (V2533) have a longer probe. The relay box on the right

© IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000
IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance
Engine Starting and Ignition System
Engine Starting and Ignition System
Basic start sequence
Purpose
Whichever method of starting is used the control is either from the EEC
or from the cockpit through the EEC. In both cases the start sequence is
initiated in the flight deck.
The engine starting system provides the power which turns the HP rotor
to a speed at which an engine start can occur. The engine ignition
system provides the electrical spark that is required to ignite the fuel
air mix in the combustor. The ignition system is used for: •
Engine starting on ground and in flight.
•
Prevention of a flame out by providing a continuous spark during engine
running when the aircraft is flying through a heavy rainstorm for
example.
Upon selection for engine start an electrical signal is sent to open the
starting air valve. The starting air valve opens and admits an air
supply into the starter motor. The starter motor rotates the high speed
external gearbox, that in turn rotates the radial drive shaft (tower
shaft), that in turn rotates the HP system (N2). As the HP system spools
up the LP system starts to rotate due to the induced airflow.
Description
•
At 10% N2 the dedicated generator comes on line.
The system comprises of the following:
•
The HP system is rotated for 30 seconds to remove rotor bow.
•
Pneumatic starter motor.
•
Starter air control valve.
•
After 30 seconds the fuel and ignition are selected on.
•
Dual ignition system.
•
•
Pneumatic ducting.
When ignition of the fuel takes place the engine accelerates towards
minimum idle
•
Start control panels on the flight deck for auto starts, manual starts
and starter motor operation.
•
ECAM indications.
Starting of the engine for the Airbus A319, 320 and 321 can be done
either: •
Manually.
•
Automatically.
Revision 2
At 43% N2 the starter air valve is deselected, by the EEC. At 50% N2 and
above the EEC auto start protection is cancelled. The engine idles at
approximately 60% N2. Note: Above 50% N2 the command for engine shut
down is done from the master lever only.

Engine Starting and Ignition System
Starter Air Control Valve Purpose The starter air control valve is
designed to control the admittance of air to the starter motor.
The starter air valve controls the airflow from the air ducting to the
starter motor.
The valve is commanded from the flight deck via the EEC.
The start valve basically comprises a butterfly type valve housed in a
cylindrical valve body with in line flanged end connectors, an actuator,
a solenoid valve and a pressure controller.
Location The starter air control valve is located on the right hand side
of the engine fan casing (intermediate module). Description The starter
air control valve consists of the following: •
Butterfly valve for airflow control.
•
Pneumatically operated.
•
Microswitch position indication for valve positional status.
•
Air filter to prevent valve operating mechanisms from contamination.
•
Failsafe position of the valve is closed.
•
Provision of a manual override for abnormal start attempts.
Manual operation The starter air valve can be opened/closed manually
using a 0.375 in square drive. Access is through a panel in the right
hand side fan cowl door. A valve position indicator is provided on the
valve body. A micro switch provides valve position feed back information
to the EEC.
The starter air control valve is a pneumatically operated, electrically
controlled shut-off valve. The valve is positioned on the lower right
hand side of the engine fan casing.

Starter Air Valve Operation
Valve closing
The starter air valve operation for opening and closing is as follows:
When the solenoid is de-energised, at approximately 6000 rpm (43%) N2,
the ball valve closes and air acting on the larger piston are vented to
atmosphere through the vent.
Engine shutdown With no pneumatic air supply available the valve is
spring loaded to the closed position. Valve opening Air upstream of the
butterfly valve is filtered and routed through an orifice in the
solenoid valve.
Air pressure and actuator spring pressure acting on the smaller piston
then closes the butterfly valve. Any loss of air pressure will cause the
butterfly valve to close under the action of the actuator spring.
Air upstream of the orifice is also admitted to the smaller piston of
the double acting actuator. When the solenoid is energised the ball
valve opens to admit air to the larger piston whilst simultaneously
closing the vent port. The air acting on the larger piston overcomes the
combined force of upstream air pressure acting on the smaller piston and
the actuator spring. Movement of the actuator is translated through the
linkage to rotate the butterfly valve towards the open position.

• QAD devices to allow for ease of maintenance. The starter motor gears
and bearings are lubricated by an integral lubrication system. A quick
attach/disconnect adapter (QAD) attaches the starter motor to the
external gearbox. A quick detach Vee clamp connects the starter motor to
the adapter. Note: There are two standards of starter motor available
for the V2500 Powerplant. The current being the synchronous clutch
engagement unit. The synchronous clutch allows for smoother crash
engagements thus reducing the wear and damage caused by such operations.

Engine Starting and Ignition System
Starter Motor Operation The starter is a pneumatically driven turbine
unit that accelerates the HP rotor to the required speed for engine
starting. The starter comprises of the following: • A single stage
turbine.
When the starter output drive shaft rotational speed increases above a
predetermined rpm, Centrifugal force overcomes the tension of the clutch
leaf springs, allowing the pawls to be pulled clear of the gear hub
ratchet teeth to disengage the output drive shaft from the turbine.
• A reduction gear train. • A clutch and an output drive shaft. These
are all housed within a case incorporating an air inlet and exhaust.
Compressed air enters the starter, impinges on the turbine blades to
rotate the turbine, and leaves through the air exhaust. The reduction
gear train converts the high speed, low torque rotation of the turbine
to low speed, high torque rotation of the gear train hub. The ratchet
teeth of the gear hub engage the pawls of the output drive shaft to
transmit drive to the external gearbox, which in turn accelerates the
engine HP compressor rotor assembly. When the air supply to the starter
is cut off, the pawls overrun the gear train hub ratchet teeth allowing
the turbine to coast to a stop. The engine HP turbine compressor
assembly, the external gearbox and starter output drive shaft continue
to rotate. Revision 2

© IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000
IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance
Thrust Reverser System
Thrust Reverser System Introduction Purpose The thrust reverser is
designed to assist the aircraft in decelerating quickly and safely upon
landing. It also assists deceleration during an aborted takeoff.
Location The thrust reverser is an integral part of the C duct assembly.
The C duct assembly is mounted to the aircraft strut by four hinged
brackets located at the top of the C ducts. They are held in the closed
position by six latch locks located at the bottom of the C ducts.
Description The reverser is a translating sleeve type system. It directs
the fan air rearwards for normal forward thrust or forwards for thrust
reverse. When the thrust reverser system is in the stow position the fan
air exhausts at the common nozzle. This produces forward thrust.
Reverse thrust is selected from the flight deck by the gated reverse
thrust levers. The EEC has control over the operation of the thrust
reverse system. All signals to and from the thrust reverser are through
the EIU and EEC. Thrust reverser system features Electronic control.
Hydraulic actuation system. Positional information feedback. Actuator
lock position sensors and feedback. Electronic safety locks. Automatic
restow system. Manual deployment and stow capability for maintenance.
Manual lockout to allow aircraft to be despatched with an inoperative
thrust reverser.
When the thrust reverser is deployed four linear motion actuators cause
the translating sleeves to move rearwards. This moves the blocker doors
from an axial to a radial position in the C duct fan exhaust area. The
blocker doors forces the fan air through the cascades in a forward
direction. The cascades are exposed whenever the thrust reverser is
deployed. Revision 2

deployment.
Thrust Reverser Assembly When the translating sleeves are in the forward
thrust position the path of the fan bypass air is in the normal forward
thrust. Rearward movement of the translating sleeves unveils the cascade
deflectors and moves the blocker flaps from an axial to a radial
position. This blocks the fan stream airflow and forces the fan efflux
through the cascade deflectors.
•
Shut off valve that is signalled to operate from the SEC.
•
The thrust reverser also has a system that will return the engine thrust
to idle should the thrust reverse system inadvertently deploy.
•
Auto restow is a system that is designed to stow the thrust reverser
when an uncommanded deployment is detected.
Methods of deployment
Indications
The thrust reverser can be deployed in one of two methods;
ECAM indications for fault annunciation of the thrust reverser system
status are done by use of proximity sensors, relay select status,
hydraulic system pressures and LVDT feedback signals.
•
•
Using the engine/aircraft hydraulic system. Moving the thrust reverse

points
for
Safety features
The locking actuator sensors detect unlocked conditions and the LVDT
detects transient and deployed conditions. The signals are relayed from
the EEC to the EIU and then to the ECAM screens.
The thrust reverse system operation is controlled by the engine
electronic control (EEC). The following are EEC controlled functions of
the thrust reverse system. The thrust reverse system incorporates a
double lock safety system to protect against inadvertent deployment.
They are; •
Landing gear control unit (LGCU).
•
Lock sensors on the locking actuators.
•
EIU inhibit relays for uncommanded in-flight

Operation Thrust reverse is selected from the flight deck by pulling up
on the thrust reverse select levers. The select levers are mounted on
the front side of the main thrust levers. The thrust levers have a gated
feature that allows thrust operation by the throttles in one direction
only. The EEC has control of the thrust reverse system operation for
deploy and stow. The EIU inhibit relay controls the DCV power signal for
the control solenoid from the EEC to the DCV. Deploy Pulling up on the
thrust reverse lever in the flight deck will send a signal for thrust
reverse select to the EEC. This will also put the main throttles in the
reverse thrust quadrant. The EEC will look for the following conditions
before thrust reverse will be allowed; • The EEC will check that the
aircraft is on the ground by checking the LGCU signal of the aircraft
computers. • The EEC will check that the engine is running by means of a
N2 signal. • The EEC cannot deploy the thrust reverser until the EIU
inhibit relay is active. • SEC control signal for the shut off valve.
The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid and the directional control valve
solenoid will both be energised for a deploy condition. This will admit
high pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow and deploy sides of the thrust
reverse system. The lower locking actuators will unlock and the EEC will
see a signal from the proximity sensor of reverser system unlocked. In
the flight deck this unlocked condition is identified as an amber
coloured REV caption on the EPR indicating gauge. Revision 2
Thrust Reverser System
When the translating sleeves have moved to 78% of the full deploy
position the amber REV indication will change to a green REV indication.
When green REV is indicated the full reverse thrust power is available
to the flight crew. Stow To stow the thrust reverse system the flight
crew will return the throttles to the idle detent position and select
levers to the down position. This will put the throttles back to the
forward thrust quadrant. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid is
energised and the directional control valve solenoid is de-energised for
a stow condition. This leaves high pressure hydraulic fluid present on
the stow side of the system. As the translating sleeves move from deploy
back to stow the flight deck indication will change from green to amber
on the REV indication. When the thrust reverser has reached the fully
stowed position the amber REV will go and the EPR gauge will return to
normal indication. This will indicate that the thrust reverser is fully
stowed and locked.

Thrust Reverser System
Controls and Indications Thrust reverse is selected from the flight deck
by use of latching selector levers that are mounted on the main throttle
control levers. Controls Pulling the levers upwards will initiate the
sequence of events that will deploy the reverser system. The EEC, in
conjunction with the EIU, controls the deployment and stowing of the
reverser system. The levers move into the thrust reverse quadrant
therefor while in this position throttle movement is only possible in
the thrust reverse mode. Movement towards the maximum throttle stop for
thrust reverse is possible but the engine will only accelerate when the
EEC has feedback of the translating sleeve status. The translating
sleeve must be beyond 78% of the fully deployed position. Stowing the
thrust reverser requires the latching select levers to be pushed down
and the main throttles will revert back to normal forward thrust. This
will also stow the reverser system.

Thrust Reverser System
Hydraulic System The hydraulic system provides the force required to
move the translating sleeves for both deploy and stow conditions. The
hydraulic system comprises of the following; •
Linear motion actuators.
•
Flex shaft.
•
Hydraulic control unit comprising of a HIV and DCV.
Linear Motion Actuators There are four linear motion actuators per C
duct set. The two upper actuators are non-locking and incorporate LVDT's
for feedback to the EEC.
The HIV controls the presence of high pressure hydraulic fluid in the
thrust reverser system. The energising of a control solenoid valve
controls this valve. For stow and deploy conditions this valve must be
energised. The DCV controls the flow direction of the high pressure
hydraulic fluid once it is in the thrust reverser system. •
The DCV will direct the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to both the stow
and deploy sides of the system for deploy conditions.
•
The DCV will direct the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow side
of the system for stow conditions.
The two lower actuators are locking they incorporate proximity sensors
to give indication to the EEC of lock and unlock conditions. Flex shaft
The four linear motion actuators are kept in synchronisation movement by
flexible shafts that have a high torsion resistance. Hydraulic Control
Unit The hydraulic control unit comprises of the following items; •
Hydraulic isolation valve (HIV).
•
Directional control valve (DCV).

Thrust Reverser System
Hydraulic Control Unit Purpose The hydraulic control unit (HCU) is
designed to control the safe passage of the high-pressure hydraulic
fluid to the thrust reverser system.
•
A filter with a clog indicator that gives a visual indication of the
filter condition when it becomes contaminated.
Location
•
A bleed valve.
The HCU is located between the top of the engine fan case and the
aircraft strut. Access is gained by opening the left hand side fan cowl
door.
•
Provision for locking out the valve operation for maintenance and
flight.
Description The HCU is a self contained LRU designed to control the flow
of high pressure hydraulic fluid. The EEC and EIU has control over the
HCU control solenoids. When the EEC detects a demand for thrust reverse
operation both EEC and EIU will signal the HCU control solenoids. The
HCU has the following features; •
A hydraulic isolation valve (HIV) which controls the flow of
high-pressure hydraulic fluid into the thrust reverser system. A control
solenoid valve controls the HIV function.
•
A directional control valve (DCV) which controls the direction of flow
of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to either the deploy or stow sides
of the system. A control solenoid valve controls the DCV function.
•
A pressure switch to feedback system pressure status to the EEC.

Hydraulic Control Unit Operation Deploy When the thrust reverser select
levers are moved to the up position the EEC detects that the thrust
reverser system is required. •
The EEC has selection control over the HIV.
•
The EIU has selection control over the DCV.
The HIV control solenoid will be energised. This moves a lockpin away
from the pilot valve chamber orifice. High pressure hydraulic fluid
enters the left hand side of the chamber and forces the pilot valve to
move to the right. The pilot valve moves against a spring that exerts a
pressure on the right hand side of the pilot valve. The pilot valve
recess moves in line with the hydraulic fluid supply tube. This admits
high pressure fluid into the thrust reverse system and initially to the
stow side of the system. The pressure switch moves to the high pressure
indicating position. The DCV control solenoid will be energised. This
moves a lockpin away from the pilot valve chamber orifice. High pressure
hydraulic fluid enters the left hand side of the chamber and forces the
pilot valve to move to the right. The pilot valve moves against a spring
that exerts a pressure on the right hand side of the pilot valve. The
pilot valve recess moves in line with the hydraulic fluid supply tube.
This admits high pressure fluid into the thrust reverse system deploy
side of the system.
Thrust Reverser System
The restrictors in the deploy supply tube to the DCV delay the pressure
build up to the deploy side so the pressure present on the stow side can
push the locking actuators towards the stow. This releases the pressure
acting on the tine locking mechanism. Stow To stow the thrust reverser
the select levers are moved to the down position. •
The EEC has selection control over the HIV.
•
The EIU has selection control over the DCV.
The DCV control solenoid is de-energised. The pilot valve moves to the
right due to spring pressure alone. This leaves high pressure hydraulic
fluid present in the stow side of the system. When the thrust reverser
system has fully stowed the EEC will sense this by a feedback signal
coming from the unlock sensors. The EEC will then de-energise the HIV
control solenoid. The control solenoid pilot valve will move to the
right due to spring pressure alone and the high pressure hydraulic fluid
is cut off from the thrust reverser system. HIV Deactivation The
deactivating lever prevents the HIV pilot valve from moving. This
prevents high pressure hydraulic fluid from entering the thrust reverser
system.
There is now pressure present in both the stow and deploy sides of the
system. Revision 2

Thrust Reverser System
Lower Locking Actuators Operation Deploy
Stow
The EEC will energise the HIV and DCV control solenoids which allows
high pressure hydraulic fluid to be present in the thrust reverser
system. This is on the stow and deploy sides.
To stow the thrust reverser the high pressure fluid present on the
deploy side of the system must be reduced to tank pressure and ported
back to the hydraulic reservoir of the aircraft.
The restrictor in the pressure feed tube to the deploy side delays the
deploy pressure build up enough to allow the stow pressure to initially
push the actuator piston towards the stow direction. This releases the
lock pressure on the tine locking mechanism.
The EEC will de-energise the DCV control solenoid and this will leave
high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the system.
The unlock sleeve is then pushed towards the right of the tine lock.
With the locking sleeve clear of the tine lock the tine lock flexible
spring type fingers are free to flex. When the locking sleeve moves a
lever assembly also moves. The lever assembly is linked to the external
area of the actuator. The lever has a target attached to it. •
When the actuator is at stow the target is in line with the proximity
sensor.
•
When the actuator is at deploy the target is away from the proximity
sensor.
The actuator will now move in the stow direction. The head end of the
actuator engages into the tine lock. The locking sleeve will move into
position to immobilise the tine lock by spring pressure. As the locking
sleeve moves to the lock position the target on the unlock indicator
moves in line with the proximity sensor. The EEC detects this and sees
that the thrust reverser system is stowed.
The EEC detects these conditions. High pressure fluid being present in
both sides of the system forces the actuator to move towards the deploy
direction. This bias of movement exists because the surface area of the
deploy side of the pressure plate is greater that the surface area of
the stow side.

Thrust Reverser System
Upper Non Locking Actuators Description The hydraulic actuators in
general control the movement of the translating sleeves. The upper non
locking actuators incorporate a linear variable displacement transducer
(LVDT) that feeds back translating sleeve status of translation and
deployment. The actuators operate in the same manner as the locking
actuators. •
For deployment the high pressure hydraulic fluid is present on both
sides of the system.
•
For stowing the high pressure hydraulic fluid is present on the stow
side of the system only.
The LVDT monitors the movement of the translating sleeves and feeds back
the signals to the EEC. This is done to tell the EEC that the
translating sleeves are in transit and when 78% of travel towards the
deploy has been achieved.

Shut Off Valve
Manual Bypass Non Return valve
Purpose
Purpose
To give additional safety to uncommanded deployments of the thrust
reverser. This is known as the third lock of safety.
For normal thrust reverser operation provides a one way directional flow
for the hydraulic fluid.
The shut off valve has a filter assembly installed in line with the
valve.
For maintenance purposes it allows the flow of hydraulic fluid easier
when manual deployment and stow of the thrust reverser is required.
Location
Location
The shut off valve is located in the aircraft strut at the front. It is
behind the HCU.
The manual bypass valve is located in the aircraft strut just behind the
shut off valve.
Description
Description
The shut off valve has the following features;
The manual bypass non return valve allows the flow of hydraulic fluid in
one direction only.
Control solenoid. Two position valve assembly. Operation The shut off
valve operation for opening and closing relies upon the signals from the
spoilers and elevators computer (SEC). Pulling up the thrust reverse
select levers will signal the SEC to open the shut off valve.
There is a very hard spring loaded valve inside that is difficult to
unseat when carrying out manual operations of the thrust reverser
system. The bypass handle allows the valve to become unseated for
maintenance operations only. Access to the bypass valve is through an
access panel located on the left hand side of the aircraft strut.
The SEC sends a signal to the shut off valve relay. The relay energises
the solenoid and opens the shut off valve. The high pressure hydraulic
fluid now flows towards the HCU. To close the shut off valve the
selection of thrust reverse levers must be in the forward thrust
position. Revision 2

Thrust Reverser System
Thrust Reverser Flex (Synchronisation) Shaft Purpose The flex shaft
purpose is to maintain synchronous movement of the actuators. This
prevents any one actuator from moving faster than the others. Location
The flex shaft is located within the deploy tube system. Description The
flex shaft system comprises of the following; T piece housing assembly.
This allows the distribution of high pressure hydraulic fluid to both
sides of the thrust reverser system. Two flexible tubes. This allows the
crossover shaft to link the reverser halves together while allowing the
C ducts to be opened. Two rigid tubes. These are found between the upper
and lower actuators. They carry hydraulic fluid to the deploy side of
the system. Three flexible shafts. These link all the actuators
together. Note: The two deploy tubes have a telescopic coupling at one
end to permit simple removal and installation without disturbing the
actuators.

Thrust Reverser Deflector Boxes (Cascades) Purpose The cascades are
designed to direct the fan air to provide the reverse thrust for the
engine. Location The cascades are located between the inner and outer
translating sleeve sleeves. They are mounted on the fixed section of the
C ducts. Description There are 16 cascades fitted to the thrust reverser
system. The cascades are designed to direct the fan air forwards thus
providing for the function of the thrust reverse system. They are
designed to direct the fan air away from the ground thus reducing the
risk of debris from being blown up and ingested into the engine. They
are designed to direct the fan air away from the airframe thus not
inducing any unnecessary stress upon the airframe itself.

Operation Thrust reverse is selected from the flight deck by pulling up
on the thrust reverse select levers. •
The EEC has main control of the thrust reverse system operation for

•
The EIU has a inhibit relay that controls the power supply signal from
the EEC to the DCV.
•
The flight crew have control of reverse thrust power selection.
Thrust Reverser System
a signal from the proximity sensor of reverser system unlocked. In the
flight deck this unlocked condition is identified as an amber coloured
REV caption on the EPR indicating gauge. When the translating sleeves
have moved to 78% of the full deploy position the amber REV indication
will change to a green REV indication. When green REV is indicated the
full reverse thrust power is available to the flight crew.
Deploy
Stow
Pulling up on the thrust reverse select lever in the flight deck will
send a signal for thrust reverse select to the EEC and EIU. This will
also put the main throttles in the reverse thrust quadrant.
To stow the thrust reverse system the flight crew will return the
throttles to the idle detent position and select levers to the down
position. This will put the throttles back to the forward thrust
quadrant.
The EEC will look for the following conditions before thrust reverse
will be allowed;
The DCV solenoid will be de-energised as commanded by the EEC via the
EIU inhibit relay. This will leave high pressure hydraulic fluid present
on the stow side of the reverser system only.
•
The EEC will check that the aircraft is on the ground by checking the
LGCU signal of the aircraft computers.
• The EEC will check that the engine is running by means of a N2 signal.
• The EIU will look for the signal from the throttle control unit for
energising of the inhibit relay. •
The SEC signal for opening the shut off valve.
The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid and the directional control valve
solenoid will both be energised for a deploy condition. This will admit
high pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow and deploy sides of the thrust
reverse system.
As the translating sleeves move from deploy back to stow the flight deck
indication will change from green to amber on the REV indication. When
the thrust reverser has reached the fully stowed position the amber REV
will go and the EPR gauge will return to normal indication. This will
indicate that the thrust reverser is fully stowed and locked.
The lower locking actuators will unlock and the EEC sees Revision 2

switch gives indication to the EEC of the thrust reverser lock or unlock
condition. In order to maintain the correct function of the switch the
distance between the target and proximity sensor must be within the AMM
recommendations. Lock Proximity Switch Check Stow the translating sleeve
and then measure the gap between the target and proximity sensor to the
AMM recommendations. If the measurements are out of limit then an
adustment is necessary. Rig the Lock Proximity Switch From the
measurements taken during the check a spacer is required to adjust the
setting to within the AMM recommendations. Disconnect the sensor and
target assemblies. Select the correct spacer for the target. Grinding of
the selected spacer may be required so as to achieve a greater accuracy
for the setting of the target and sensor.

Troubleshooting
IAE V2500 Troubleshooting Introduction In order to locate the source of
an engine problem both quickly and efficiently, it is essential that the
aircraft maintenance engineer is aware of the fundamental approach to
troubleshooting required on the Airbus A319/320/321.
The most common and straightforward menu selection is 'Trouble Shooting
Procedures'. If the user were to select 'Trouble Shooting Manual', this
would require the user to insert a known trouble shooting task reference
number in order to progress.
Having acquired the knowledge of various engine systems functionality
and operation during this course, we are now in a position to take the
course the natural step forward and discuss the all-important
methodology of isolating and identifying the source of a problem.
Unless a procedural task has been already identified during previous
investigation activity it will not be practical to use, as its selection
would be dependent knowing which system has the fault.
An important tool available to the engineer is the A319/A320/A321
'Computer Assisted Aircraft Trouble Shooting' (CAATS) CD-ROM. This
valuable aid provides the user with an enormous amount of detail and
information.
Below is a screen shot showing the opening menu options and for the
purpose of these training notes we are using 'British Midland' as the
'Log on Airline'.
This manual is revised and issued every three months. Upon receipt and
installation of the up-dated version the previous version is
automatically overwritten and the previous disc is now no longer valid
or useable. The CAATS CD-ROM is password protected for each airline, as
it is tailored specifically for each operator's requirements. Therefore
it is essential that the user always access the procedures for their own
particular airline. After inserting the correct password the user is
presented with the screen shot below.

IAE V2500 Troubleshooting Introduction continued: Upon selecting
'Trouble Shooting Procedures' the user is then presented with the screen
shot (fig. 1) shown below.
These are generally of a 'Class 1' level which would prevent the
aircraft from being dispatched unless the problem and source of the
message had been rectified. Check Minimum Equipment List (MEL). 2.
ECAM STATUS (Inoperative Maintenance Status).
Systems
and
The presence of an ECAM Status Message 'STS' is automatically displayed
on the Upper ECAM Screen during Flight phase 1 (Electrical Power 'on'
before first engine start) and Flight Phase 10 (When the second engine
has been shut down after the flight). It is used to highlight a problem
or degradation in the built in redundancy facility of the FADEC System.
This feature prevents un-wanted distractions of system degradation being
shown to the pilot during the flight. A fault of this nature is
dispatchable and the fault can be left un-rectified for up to ten days.

Check Minimum Equipment List (MEL) the Status Page can then be selected
by pressing the STS button on the Systems Page Select Panel. This will
then provide information under the 'Maintenance' heading regarding the
failure, for example ENG 1(2) FADEC or ENG 1 (2) EIU.
From this menu it is possible to enter into the trouble shooting process
with information derived from a variety of sources:

CFDS FAULT MESSAGE
Centralised Fault Display System (CFDS) This menu selection is one of
the most common methods of entering into the Trouble Shooting process.
By interpreting the information provided on the Post Flight Report (PFR)
and completing the necessary data field boxes, the user can quickly
locate the appropriate Trouble Shooting task for this particular systems
problem.
Completing the Class of Failure data can make further refinement of
identifying the task. In this case we had an upper ECAM warning message,
so in this example we can identify it as a 'Class 1' fault.
In this example we have a problem with the Number 2 Engine's Fuel Heat
Management System. This message appeared on the upper ECAM as an 'ECAM
WARNING' this is a Class 1 failure and is not dispatchable. The CFDS
Fault Message is the text contained under the heading 'FAILURE MESSAGES'
on the Post Flight Report. Again, in this example the Failure Message
that is linked to the Upper ECAM 'ENG 2 FUEL HEAT SYS' is: 'FUL DIV RET
VLV/HC/EEC2' This text along with the ATA reference number: '73-13-42'
and the Source: 'EIU2FAD' is copied into the text boxes as shown on
(fig. 6) opposite.

E V2500 Troubleshooting Centralised Fault Display System (CFDS) The
purpose of the CFDS is to give the maintenance engineers a central
maintenance aid to intervene at system or sub-system level from a
Multipurpose Centralised Display Unit (MCDU) located on the flight deck.
The MCDU allows the engineer to; •
Interrogate a variety of systems using Built in Test Equipment (BITES)
for maintenance information.
•
To initiate system return to service tests.
The detection of the failures, processing and formatting of the failure
messages to be displayed is carried out in each systems individual
systems BITE. There are two MCDU's and either the Captain or First
Officer's MCDU can be used.

Failure Classification and Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) The MMEL
cannot be used as a Minimum Equipment List (MEL) due to the fact that it
is not related to operational requirements, specific operations or
airlines particular definitions. The MMEL can be used as a basis for
particular operators own MEL. The MEL should be used to establish
dispatchability for a particular operation.
The item is then either repaired or may be deferred as per the MEL or
other approved means acceptable to the Administrator prior to further
operation.
The MEL does not include those items that are obviously required for
aircraft safety, such as wings, engines etc. The MEL does not include
those items that do not affect the airworthiness of the aircraft, such
as galley equipment, entertainment system etc.
Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) Repair Intervals
Note; All items, which are related to the airworthiness of the aircraft
and not included in the list, are automatically required to operational
for each flight. MEL Preamble The MEL is intended to permit operation
with inoperative items of equipment for a period of time, until repairs
can be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. In order to maintain
acceptable levels of safety and reliability the MEL establishes
limitations on the duration of and conditions for operation with
inoperative equipment. When an item of equipment is discovered to be
inoperative, it is reported by making an entry into the Aircraft
Maintenance Record/Logbook as prescribed by the Federal Aviation
Regulations (FAR).
Revision 2
MEL conditions and limitations do not relieve the operator from
determining that the aircraft is in a condition for safe operation with
items of equipment inoperative. All users of an approved MEL, must
effect repairs of inoperative systems or components, deferred in
accordance with the MEL, at or prior to the repair times established by
the following letter designators: •
Category A: To be repaired within the time interval specified in the
remarks column of the operator's approved MEL.
•
Category B: To be repaired within three (3) consecutive calendar days
(72 hours), excluding the day the malfunction occurred.
•
Category C: To be repaired within ten (10) consecutive calendar days),
excluding the day the malfunction occurred.
•
Category D: To be repaired within one hundred and twenty (120) days),
excluding the day the malfunction occurred.

of their existence to the Flight Crew or to the Maintenance Engineer
during ground operation and testing. Class 1 Failures are indicated, by
means of the upper ECAM display or local warnings. Procedures to be
followed by the operator to help to ameliorate the problem may also be
displayed. Class 2 The operator is informed of a Class 2 failure on the
ECAM STATUS page, which only shows the system, affected by the Class 2
failure. A white 'STS' symbol appears on the upper ECAM. Class 3 The
operator is not informed of Class 3 failures. Class 3 failures are only
accessible through the Centralised Fault Display System (CFDS) via the
MCDU in 'menu mode'

The majority of FADEC failures take the form of the following Acronym
ending. These assist in describing the fault.
A detected difference in the feedback from the sensors of Channel A and
Channel B e.g. LVDT's, thermocouples or micro-switches.
When attached to the end of the abbreviation of the system that is
experiencing the problem it is possible to anticipate the
troubleshooting process. A complete listing of all FADEC fault acronyms
and a description of what they relate to can be found later in this
