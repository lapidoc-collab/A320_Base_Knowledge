LANDING GEAR SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW
EXTENSION/RETRACTION SYSTEM Landing Gear Control and Interface Units
(LGCIU) 1 and 2 electrically control the gear and door sequencing. Each
LGCIU in turn controls a complete gear cycle: one UP selection and one
DOWN selection. The LGCIU in control is the active unit and the other is
the standby unit. The active unit changes after each retract/extend
cycle (when the L/G control lever is moved away from the DOWN position).
If a failure occurs in the active LGCIU, the standby LGCIU becomes
active. Duplicated sensors monitor the gear up and down positions, the
door closed and open positions and the shock absorber compressed (ground
signal) and fully extended (flight signal) positions. An interlock
mechanism prevents unsafe retraction by locking the lever in the DOWN
position when any shock absorber is compressed. The two systems are
electrically segregated with different connections on the related
selector valves. In case of failure, the gear can be mechanically
extended from the cockpit by means of a gravity extension crank handle.
After free fall extension, the L/G doors stay open and the L/G is locked
down by the lockstays and springs. The normal extension and retraction
control is available when the free-fall handle-assembly is put back to
its initial position.

LANDING GEAR SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2)
Normal braking is obtained when: - The green hydraulic pressure is
available, - The Anti/SKID and Nose/Wheel Steering control switch is in
the ON position, - The Parking Brake control switch is in the OFF
position. Electrical control is obtained: - Through the pedals, -
Automatically on the ground by the auto brake system, - In flight when
the gear control lever is set to UP (in flight braking).
BSCU computes the anti skid orders during normal braking. During
alternate braking, BSCU computes the anti-skid orders and sends them to
the ABCU for execution. If there is a BSCU failure or low pressure in
the green and yellow hydraulic systems, the anti skid function is lost.
The pilot must then refer to the triple pressure indicator to control
the brake pressure and to prevent wheel locking. But the ABCU sets a
maximum limit of 1000 PSI for the brake pressure. If there is a loss of
the green and yellow hydraulic systems, braking is still available with
the brake accumulator. With the accumulator pressure only, a maximum of
7 full brake pedal applications can be done.
ALTERNATE BRAKING
PARKING BRAKE
The alternate brake system is energized by the yellow hydraulic system.
A brake accumulator can supply hydraulic power for emergencies. The
Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU) electrically controls the
alternate braking with A/SKID or without A/SKID. The ABCU becomes active
when the normal brake system is defective and/or the green system has a
low hydraulic pressure. The data comes from the BSCU. The brake pedals
give braking inputs, which are transmitted through the Alternate Brake
Pedal Transmitter Unit to the ABCU. The ABCU will control the braking
pressure. The braking, wheel speed and aircraft speed data are sent to
the BSCU to calculate the A/SKID protection. The braking pressure is
read on the triple indicator.
The yellow hydraulic system or the brake accumulators supply brake
pressure. Putting ON the parking brake deactivates the other braking
modes and the A/SKID system.
SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) NORMAL BRAKING
ANTI SKID FUNCTION The A/SKID function is a part of the BSCU and can be
set to OFF with the A/SKID & N/W STeeRinG switch.

LANDING GEAR SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued)
NOSE WHEEL STEERING The steering system uses the yellow hydraulic system
to operate a steering actuating cylinder, which changes the direction of
the NLG wheels. The steering system receives hydraulic pressure in the
following conditions: - A/SKID & N/W STeeRinG switch is in ON
position, - towing control lever is in normal position, - at least one
ENG MASTER switch is ON, - aircraft is on ground. The steering system is
controlled by the BSCU, which receives order from: - the steering hand
wheels (orders added algebraically), - the rudder pedals, - the
autopilot. When the rudder pedal disconnect pushbutton is pressed in,
N/WS is disconnected from the pedals. The BSCU transforms the orders
into N/WS angle. That angle has the following limits: - Ruder pedals:
max 6 degrees, - Hand wheels: max 74 degrees. The NLG is equipped with
Rotary Variable Differential Transducers (RVDTs), which are used as
feedback sensors to the BSCU.

BTMU One Brake Temperature Monitoring Unit (BTMU) per gear transmits the
brake temperature from the temperature sensors (one per brake) to the
BSCU.
FAN The brake cooling system is a manually controlled system that
decreases the temperature of the brakes when they are too hot. This
optional system allows the brakes to be cooled in a short time period.
One brake fan system with one BRK FAN HOT P/BSW is installed.
TPIS The Tire Pressure Indicating System (TPIS) includes an electronic
sensor on each wheel and a Tire Pressure Indicating Computer (TPIC). The
TPIC controls and monitors the operation of the system and sends data to
other interfaced systems. As an MPD item, the tire pressure can be
checked through: - a pressure gage (tool), - or the ECAM WHEEL page.

LANDING GEAR NORMAL OPERATION (3) EXTENSION (continued) DOOR OPENING
When DOWN is selected, the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit
(LGCIU) takes control of the extension sequence. The LGCIU signals the
doors to open via selector valves and the door proximity detectors
signal the "doors fully open position" back to the LGCIU in order to
continue the sequence.

stay actuators to back up the downlock springs. Door uplock proximity
detectors signal to the LGCIU that the doors are uplocked. As the doors
begin to close, the LGCIU cancels the "gear extended" signal while
maintaining the "door close" signal. The extension sequence is
completed.

LANDING GEAR NORMAL OPERATION (3) RETRACTION Setting the L/G control
lever to UP causes systems 1 and 2 changeover. This allows the system
which was previously in standby to control the next retraction and
extension sequence. Each LGCIU controls one complete gear cycle: one UP
selection and one DOWN selection.
DOOR OPENING The LGCIU must detect all three shock absorbers fully
extended before allowing the selection of the L/G control lever to UP.
The LGCIU signals the doors to open via selector valves and the door
proximity detectors signal the doors fully open position back to the
LGCIU in order to continue the sequence.

LANDING GEAR FREE FALL EXTENSION (3) GENERAL Free fall extension is used
either when : - both Landing Gear Control Interface Units (LGCIUs) have
failed, - there is green hydraulic low pressure, - one door cannot be
opened hydraulically, - one gear leg cannot be lowered hydraulically. If
both LGCIUs fail the solenoids are not energized and the door "close"
lines are not pressurized. If the green hydraulic pressure is low the
door "close" lines are not pressurized.
INITIAL CONFIGURATION The safety valve is open and residual pressure
supplies the door "close" line downstream of the selector valve. Gears
and doors are uplocked. NOTE: Note: That the door bypass valves (1, 2
and 3) are only operated during ground maintenance.

MAIN LANDING GEAR DESCRIPTION (3) MAIN FITTING (continued) SHOCK
ABSORBER The shock absorber is a telescopic oleo-pneumatic unit which
includes the sliding tube. It is installed in the main fitting to
transmit the landing, take off and taxiing loads to the wing. When the
shock absorber is compressed, the load is transmitted to the hydraulic
fluid and nitrogen gas. The shock absorber is a 2 stage unit and
contains four chambers: - a first stage gas chamber contains gas at a
low pressure and hydraulic fluid, - a recoil chamber that contains
hydraulic fluid, - a compression chamber that contains hydraulic
fluid, - a 2nd stage gas chamber that contains gas at a high pressure.
Primary control of the shock absorber recoil is: - the fluid flow from
the recoil chamber into the gas chamber, - the fluid flow from the gas
chamber into the compression chamber.

MAIN LANDING GEAR DESCRIPTION (3) ACTUATING CYLINDER
TORQUE LINKS/SLAVE LINK
The MLG actuating cylinder is installed on the main fitting at the
piston rod end. Two lugs attach the body to the wing rear spar. When it
is hydraulically supplied: - the piston rod extends to retract the
MLG, - the piston rod retracts to extend the MLG.
The torque links align the main fitting and the sliding tube, but let
vertical movement between the parts occur. The slave link is mounted at
the rear.
SIDE STAY ASSEMBLY The main components of the side stay assembly are: -
a basic side stay, - a lock stay, - a lock stay actuator, - two lock
springs, - the proximity sensors and their related targets. The lock
springs move the lock stay to an over center position during the
extension cycle.
TORQUE LINK DAMPER The torque link damper is a spring-centered, two-way
hydraulic unit, which has its own hydraulic reservoir. Its function is
to decrease the landing vibrations through the torque links. The
hydraulic fluid contents of the damper are shown by the extension of the
reservoir when it is pressurized. When the contents are correct, the
"FULL" and "REFILL" level indications are in view.
LOCK STAY The lock stay provides an over center stop and a geometric
lock of the L/G.
LOCK STAY ACTUATOR During MLG extension the two lock stay actuator ports
are open to return; a restrictor controls the rate of MLG extension. It
is pressurized to extend during MLG door closure until hydraulic
pressure on the door close line is released. During MLG retraction, the
hydraulic fluid retracts the piston which opens the over centered lock,
to fold the side stay and the lock stay against the lock springs.

MAIN LANDING GEAR DOORS DESCRIPTION (2) GENERAL
FIXED FAIRING
Each Main Landing Gear (MLG) is enclosed by one door and two fairings: -
one main door, - one hinged fairing, - one fixed fairing.
The fix fairing is attached to the gear on 5 points and is fully
adjustable in vertical and horizontal directions.
MAIN DOOR The main door is attached to the fuselage structure by two
hinges and is operated by a hydraulic actuator. Attached to the forward
end of the main door are the hydraulic actuator and an uplock roller
that is used to keep the main door in the closed position. Installed on
the rear end of the main door are steps, used for access to the gear
well compartment. Two ramps are installed on the inside of the main
door. These ramps make sure that the gear does not catch on the main
door during a free-fall extension. Two proximity sensors and targets
send the door open position signal of the main door to the Landing Gear
Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs).
MLG DOOR UPLOCK The MLG door uplock is closed mechanically, locking the
door in the closed position and hydraulically opened, releasing the door
during normal extension and retraction sequences. The uplock can also be
opened mechanically in free-fall extension and ground door opening.
HINGED FAIRING The hinged fairing is attached to the wing skin by a
single hinge and to the L/G by an adjustable tie-rod. The adjustable
tie-rod causes the hinged fairing to follow the L/G during the L/G
extension and retraction.

NOSE LANDING GEAR DESCRIPTION (3) SHOCK ABSORBER The shock absorber is
of the single chamber type without a separation piston and is double
acting. The shock absorber is filled with hydraulic fluid and nitrogen
through a single standard servicing valve in the upper part of the leg.
Calibration of the metering devices in the shock absorber is the same
for the different versions of the aircraft. Holes are included in the
leg to show possible leaks from the dynamic seal of the shock absorber.
It is possible to remove the shock absorber without drainage of the
hydraulic fluid. A placard bonded to the leg shows the filling curves.
The shock absorber includes 2 centering cams, the lower cam is part of
the plunger tube and the upper cam is part of the sliding tube. When the
shock absorber is fully extended the pressure of the nitrogen causes the
cams to engage. The wheels then return automatically to the center
position.

sequences.
DRAG STRUT ASSEMBLY The drag strut assembly consists of a forestay at
the top and a tubular arm at the bottom that are interconnected by a
universal joint. The uplock roller is installed on the upper hinge pin
of the universal joint.
LOCKSTAY DOWNLOCK ACTUATOR The downlock actuator locks and unlocks both
brace assemblies of the lock stay. It is assisted by two springs.
SLIDING TUBE The sliding tube includes the wheel axle. It is inclined 9
degrees forward; this design allows the wheels to return freely to the
centered position and decrease the shimmy effect. The towing lug is
designed to shear if the towing load is more than the limit. The two
system proximity detectors provide signals for both gear extended and
wheel centered positions.
ROTATING TUBE The rotating tube is inside the shock strut. It is
equipped with a pinion that transmits steering orders from the steering
actuating cylinder via the rotating tube and the torque link to the
wheel axle.
TORQUE LINK The torque link is installed on the rear. It connects the
sliding tube to the rotating tube.

needle supplies the alternate breaking accumulator supply pressure. The
bottom needles supply pressure sent to the left and right brakes units
(indication available only if ALTERNATE BRAKING is active or PARKING
BRAKE is set to on).
WHEELS
The normal servovalve has a dual function: it regulates braking
pressure, which depends on BSCU braking orders, and anti-skid control
pressure delivered to the brakes. This servovalve with direct control
laws is fully

The ABCU controls and monitors the alternate braking system with and
without anti-skid protection. The ABCU is automatically activated if: -
the anti-skid is faulty, - the A/SKID switch is selected to OFF (BSCU
OFF) - the BSCU is not serviceable (both system 1 & 2 have failed), -
the normal braking has failed, - the pressure downstream the selector
valve drops below a given threshold, - only the batteries supply the
A/C.
Each main wheel has multidisc carbon brakes. Each main wheel rotation
speed given by a tachometer is sent to the BSCU for anti-skid
computation.

SHUTTLE VALVES The shuttle valves give the hydraulic priority for brake
supply to the parking brake.
PARKING BRAKE CONTROL VALVE The parking brake electrical control valve
is operated by the parking brake handle. When it is open, a signal is
sent to the BSCU and the ABCU in order to override all other braking
modes. If the normal braking system is available and, if the pedals are
depressed when the PARK BRK is ON and the pressure commanded by the
pedal deflection exceeds the pressure delivered by the park brake
system, the normal system will send a complement of pressure to the
normal set of pistons to reach the commanded value.
ACCUMULATOR The brake accumulator is supplied from the yellow hydraulic
system and can provide pressure to the alternate brake system.

AUTO-BRAKE SYSTEM D/O (3) The ON light comes on blue when the
corresponding rate is armed.
AUTOBRAKE MODES The AUTO BRaKe panel is used to select the desired
deceleration rate of the system. MAXimum mode is normally selected for
take-off: in the event of an aborted take-off, maximum braking pressure
is sent to the normal brake pistons as soon as ground spoilers
deployment order is present. MEDium or LOw modes are selected for
landing: progressive pressure is sent to the brakes, for respectively 2
or 4 seconds after the ground spoilers deployment order.
ADIRS The Air Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) signals the
aircraft deceleration rate to the Braking and Steering Control Unit
(BSCU) to be compared with the selected deceleration mode for braking
computation.
A/SKID & N/W STRG SWITCH
ACTIVATION The automatic braking system is activated by at least 2 of
the 3 ground spoiler extension signals coming from the Spoiler Elevator
Computers (SECs). The DECEL light comes on green when actual aircraft
deceleration is 80 % of the selected rate (LO and MED modes) or 0.27 g
(MAX mode).
DISARMING The autobrake is disarmed by: - releasing the selected P/B
out, - loss of one or more arming conditions, - applying sufficient
force to the pedals when autobrake is operating, - ground spoilers
retraction. If ground spoilers are extended again, autobrake will be
activated as well.
The A/SKID & N/W STRG switch activates the anti-skid system and enables
autobrake arming. ON: anti-skid (A/SKID) and nose wheel steering (N/W
STRG) are available and autobrake can be armed provided the green
pressure is valid. If green pressure drops: - yellow pressure takes over
automatically, anti-skid is available, nose wheel steering is still
available, - and autobrake cannot be armed. OFF: anti-skid, nose wheel
steering, normal brake and autobrake are lost.
ARMING The autobrake system is armed if one of the three modes P/B (LO,
MED or MAX) is pressed in and the following conditions are met: - green
pressure available, - BSCU electrically powered, - no failure in the
normal braking system.

ANTI-SKID FUNCTION (3) PURPOSE
ABCU
The Anti-Skid (A/SKID) system gives the maximum braking efficiency as it
keeps each individual wheel at the maximum deceleration rate avoiding a
skidding configuration.
The Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU) controls the alternate braking
components during alternate braking with or without A/SKID. The ABCU
determines the braking orders according to the brake pedal deflections
measured by the Brake Pedal Transmitter Unit (BPTU). The ABCU combines
these braking orders with the antiskid orders sent by BSCU. The ABCU
send the braking orders, combined or not with antiskid control orders,
to the alternate brake DDVs.
BSCU The Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU) gives the A/SKID
control during normal and alternate braking by either system 1 or 2 of
the BSCU. Systems 1 and 2 have independent power supplies, and at each
power up, the first system supplied takes control. If the two systems
are supplied simultaneously. System 1 has priority and system 2 is in
standby. System on standby will take control when L/G control lever is
placed in the DOWN position.
SV AND DDV The normal SV is connected to the BSCU. The two coils of the
normal SV are connected to systems 1 and 2 respectively. The alternate
DDV is connected to the ABCU which controls it.
PRINCIPLE
ADIRU
The speed of each main gear wheel, given by a tachometer, is compared
with the A/C speed supplied by the Air Data Inertial Reference Units
(ADIRUs). A reference speed is determined by the BSCU from the
longitudinal deceleration given by ADIRUs 1, 2 or 3. When the speed of a
wheel decreases below 0.87 times the reference speed, brake release
orders are given to that wheel to maintain the wheel deceleration rate
at that value.
The required reference speed during braking is directly obtained from
the average between the values from the three ADIRUs. In case the ADIRU
data is not valid, the reference speed is equal to the maximum of either
MLG wheel speeds. A/C deceleration is limited to 1.7 m/s² (5.6 ft/s²).
REGULATION The operational amplifier compares the calculated reference
speed with the speed of the decelerating wheel. The operational
amplifier supplies numerical values which are converted into current to
supply the coil of the normal Servovalve (SV) and sends it to the
Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU).

BRAKE SYSTEM OPERATION (3) GENERAL The hydraulic braking architecture is
shown with all components. NOTE: Note that only their main functions are
shown.
NORMAL BRAKING The hydraulic braking operation is identical for
automatic braking, manual braking and in-flight braking. NOTE: Note that
during in-flight braking, Anti-Skid (A/SKID) function is inhibited by
the Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU). Normal braking and A/SKID
regulations are electrically controlled by the BSCU. OPERATION: The
selector valve is energized. The normal brake servovalves supply a
pressure which depends on the control current delivered by the BSCU. The
manifold comprises the servovalves, the pressure transducers and the
hydraulic fuses. The hydraulic fuses stop the flow in the lines in case
of leakage. During manual braking, the brake pedal transmitter units
provide an artificial feel at the pedals. The artifical feel at the
pedals is provided by means of 2 sets of spring rods, that are as well
putting the pedals to its initial position when the force is removed. A
pressure transducer downstream of the normal brake selector valve sends
the hydraulic pressure information to the BSCU and the ALTN Braking
Control Unit (ABCU). A pressure lower than 90 bar or all other normal
braking failure lets the ABCU activate the ALTN braking mode.

BRAKE SYSTEM OPERATION (3) ALTN BRAKING WITH A/SKID The ALTN braking
with A/SKID is electrically controlled and hydraulically operated. The
yellow High Pressure (HP) system supplies the ALTN braking. A pressure
transducer informs the ABCU in case of yellow LP. When the normal
braking is faulty or the pressure downstream the normal selector valve
drops, the BSCU informs the ABCU, which becomes active. OPERATION: The
orders are entered through the pedals and an ALTN brake pedal
transmitter unit transmits the orders to the ABCU. The ABCU opens the
ALTN brake selector valve. The current sent to the Direct Drive Valves
(DDVs) is proportional to the pressure applied on the brake pedals. The
pressure output from each DDV goes through its related shuttle valve and
the hydraulic fuse. Each ALTN brake manifold comprises one alternate DDV
and one hydraulic fuse. One ALTN brake pressure transducer is installed
at each alternate brake manifold, downstream of the hydraulic fuse. They
transmit brake pressure data to the ACCU/PRESS triple indicator to ABCU
and the BSCU. The BSCU uses it for the A/SKID function. If a wheel
starts to skid, the BSCU sends a signal to the ABCU to reduce the
current in the related DDV. The hydraulic fuse stops the flow in the
line in case of leakage.

BRAKE SYSTEM OPERATION (3) ALTN BRAKING WITHOUT A/SKID In case of A/SKID
failure during the ALTN braking with A/SKID, the ABCU automatically
controls the ALTN braking system without A/SKID protection. Moreover, in
the event of insufficient yellow hydraulic pressure, the brake
accumulator supplies the brakes (emergency braking). Thus, the ABCU
inhibits the antiskid protection and maintains a predetermined level of
braking even when the brake pedals are fully released. This is to
prevent the loss of hydraulic fluid from the accumulator. OPERATION:
braking orders are sent to the ABCU via the ALTN brake pedal transmitter
unit. The ABCU energizes the ALTN brake selector valve and applies to
the DDV a current proportional to the ALTN brake pedal transmitter unit
signals. To reduce the risk of tire burst when A/SKID is not available,
the ABCU limits the brake pressure to 1000 psi (70 bar). To release this
limitation, the ALTN brake pressure transducers measure the brake
pressure and send this data to the ABCU. These transducers give visual
indication on the yellow ACCU/PRESS triple indicator. A third set of
potentiometers in the ALTN brake pedal transmitter unit supplied by the
HOT BATTERY BUS lets the ABCU brake the A/C during towing operation.

BRAKE SYSTEM OPERATION (3) PARKING BRAKE/ULTIMATE EMERGENCY BRAKING The
brakes are supplied either by the yellow HP manifold or the brake
accumulator. OPERATION: When the parking brake handle is set to the "ON"
position, the shuttle valves give the hydraulic priority for the brake
supply to the parking brake. When the parking brake control valve is
open, a signal is sent to the BSCU and the ABCU in order to override all
other braking modes. If the brake accumulator pressure becomes low when
the parking brake is on, normal braking using the pedals can be applied
to stop the A/C. When the pedal deflection order exceeds the pressure
delivered by the parking brake, the BSCU sends a complement of pressure
to the normal set of pistons to reach the commanded value.

B2 SCOPE
Two check valves ensure the distribution of fluid from the accumulator
to the chamber of the steering actuator.
CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL
TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE.
BYPASS VALVE
GENERAL
The bypass valve interconnects the two chambers of the steering actuator
in the event of hydraulic system depressurization. The bypass valve
opens if the pressure exceeds 273 bar (4000 psi).
The nose wheel steering system is supplied by the yellow hydraulic
system and is composed of several components which are described in
detail in the following sections.
ANTI-SHIMMY VALVES There is one anti-shimmy valve per steering actuator
chamber.
SWIVEL SELECTOR VALVE
STEERING ACTUATOR
The swivel selector valve is installed co-axially with respect to the
L/G retraction axis and provides hydraulic power supply when the gear is
extended. When the gear starts to retract, the swivel selector valve
cuts the hydraulic power supply.
The steering actuator drives the rotating tube, which is part of the NLG
structure, via a rack-and-pinion assembly.
CHECK VALVE/FILTER A 40-micron filter and a check valve are installed in
the hydraulic power supply line followed with a second check valve
mounted between the filter and the servo valve.
ACCUMULATOR The anti-shimmy accumulator supplies pressurized fluid in
case of cavitation in one of the two chambers of the steering actuator.
The accumulator can supply fluid pressurized up to 15 bar (220 psi).
BLEED SCREW
SERVO VALVE
A bleed screw allows bleeding and depressurization of the hydraulic
block.
The servo valve is of the deflection-jet type. It is equipped with a
Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT) sensor which detects the
position of the slide valve. The LVDT provides position feedback for the
steering control.
NOTE
ADJUSTABLE DIAPHRAGM The adjustable diaphragms are used to adjust the
flow to each actuating cylinder chamber and consequently the wheel
steering speed.

BSCU CONTROL INTERFACES (3) ADIRU
PACK CONTROLLERS
The aircraft reference speed for nose wheel steering and anti-skid
functions is obtained by processing the inertial deceleration from the
Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs).
After wheel speed computation the BSCU energizes wheel speed relays.
These relays send a signal to the pack controllers for pack ram air
inlet operation during take-off and landing phases.
SEC Two of the three ground spoilers extended signals coming from the
Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) must be present to enable automatic
braking.
LGCIU Inputs from both Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs)
serve for braking and nose wheel steering functions control logic.
LGCIUs receive wheel speed indications. These signals are used for BITE
inhibition.
ELAC The link between the Braking Steering Control Unit (BSCU) and the
ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) serves for nose wheel steering purposes
with orders coming from rudder pedals and autopilot.
BTMU The BSCU changes analog signals from the Brake Temperature
Monitoring Units (BTMUs) into digital ones for temperature indication on
the lower ECAM display unit.
TACHOMETERS Tachometers send wheel speed values to the BSCU enabling
reference speed computation and also to the SECs for ground spoilers

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) PURPOSE The Tire Pressure Indicating
System (TPIS) continuously monitors the absolute pressure of each
individual tire and provides cockpit indications and warnings.
PRESSURE TRANSDUCER A pressure transducer installed in the wheel rim
measures the pressure of each tire. The pressure transducer gives a DC
signal from 0 to 100mV in proportion to the pressure.
INTERFACES The signal from the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit
(LGCIU) is used to change the tire pressure threshold for on-ground or
in-flight warnings.
ENGINE OIL PRESSURE SWITCHES The engine oil pressure signal is sent to
the TPIS detection unit for information concerning engine running.
ROTATING MECHANISM The rotating mechanism serves to transmit the tire
pressure signal from the wheel to the axle. The rotating transformer
also provides the necessary power supply for the electronic module and
the pressure transducer in the form of a 3125Hz signal.
NOTE: Tire pressure warnings are only memorized by the BITE when at
least one engine is running to prevent false warnings during wheel
change.
ELECTRONIC MODULE The integrated electronic module amplifies the signal
from the pressure transducer and changes the voltage into frequency by
means of a converter. The voltage to frequency converter gives a signal
which varies from 50 to 100kHz for a pressure range from 0 to 300 psi.
ROTATING TRANSFORMER The rotating transformer transmits the tire
pressure value from the wheel to the detection unit.
DETECTION UNIT The detection unit comprises a microprocessor which
provides data processing and distribution of each tire pressure
including normal and abnormal pressure signals for ECAM indication and

Display System (CFDS) monitoring. The TPIS detection unit permanently
performs a test of the unit itself, the rotating mechanism and the
pressure transducer. The test is only stopped for data processing and
distribution.
NOTE: A number of cases have been reported where the tachometers were
cross connected on the landing gear. The consequence is the loss of
anti-skid on one wheel and loss of the braking pressure on the adjacent
one if anti-skid is active. This can lead to reduced controllability on
ground and thus potentially to runway excursion. A new heat shrink
colour coding of the tachometer harnesses has been implemented in order
to enhance identification of the tachometer harness to prevent cross
connection:

LANDING GEAR SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) ACCUMULATOR
SERVICING MLG SHOCK ABSORBER Charging valves are installed on the MLG to
fill the two-stage shock absorber with nitrogen. As a Maintenance
Planning Document (MPD) task, the check of the Main Landing Gear (MLG)
shock absorber charge is done by measuring and recording the dimension
H. Correct values will be found in the AMM and instructions are given on
the MLG strut cylinder.
A check of the nitrogen fill pressure is performed via the accumulator
pressure gage on the yellow brake accumulator. The relief valve allows
the hydraulic depressurization of the accumulator to check its nitrogen
pre-charge as required by the MPD.
MLG SPARE SEAL ACTIVATING VALVE Each MLG fitting has a spare
seal-activating valve. This valve is used to isolate the bottom gland
seal if a hydraulic leak occurs from that position. Closing the spare
seal-activating valve will isolate the bottom gland seals and activate
the top gland seals. NOTE: It is recommended that all gland seals on the
applicable MLG be replaced at subsequent scheduled maintenance.
NLG SHOCK ABSORBER As a MPD task, the check of the NLG shock absorber
charge pressure is performed by measuring and recording the dimension H
on the NLG strut. Correct values of this dimension are given in the AMM
and on the NLG servicing chart. If nitrogen refilling is necessary, it
can be done via the charging valve. NOTE: You can complete this
procedure with the A/C on the ground or on jacks. If the A/C is on
jacks, it must be positioned correctly.

the Landing Gear Wheel Well is done with the Landing Gear Doors in the
closed position. When it is possible, do the Tire Pressure Check when
the tires are cold. If it is necessary to do the check when the tires
are hot: the pressure in the tires will be higher than the nominal value
(you must not deflate a hot tire). Readjust the tire pressure using
Nitrogen only and refer to the AMM Tire inflation tables (32-41-00). The
AMM Tire inflation tables give all the pressure values versus aircraft
weight (MRW) and tire sizes. This table is given as an example.

JACKING (2) GENERAL Three jacking points, when equipped with jacking
pads, are used to lift the aircraft. The forward point "A" is located
forward of the nose landing gear. The points "B" are located outboard of
the engine pylons. A safety stay must be positioned at the rear of the
aircraft after jacking to stabilize the aircraft. You can lift the
aircraft at the forward jacking point only, with the wheels of the main
landing gear on the ground. When the aircraft is weighed on landing gear
jacks the following jacking points must be used to lift it. - 2 jacking
points located in the main landing gear, - 1 jacking point located in
the nose landing gear.
The LH, RH and nose jack pad adapters are different and must not be
interchanged. Those for the A321 are also different from those of the
other aircraft and must not be interchanged.
LIMITATIONS The open air jacking operation is limited if the wind
velocity exceeds permissible values which depend on aircraft gross
weight and center of gravity position. In any condition, the aircraft
must be pointing upwind.
PRECAUTIONS Before you lift the aircraft, you must be sure that the
ground safety-locks are in position on the landing gears and the weight
of fuel is applied equally on the two sides of the aircraft centerline.
The three jacks must be operated together. When the jacking operation is
completed, install the safety stay to make the aircraft stable. Do not
use the safety stay to lift the aircraft. The safety stay must be
removed for the gear swing.
JACKING POINTS Put jacking pads below the jacking points to apply the
loads equally. NOTE: It is necessary to use the jack pad adapters when
the aircraft is put on jacks.

JACKING (2) LEVELING AND WEIGHING WEIGHING You can weigh the aircraft
with: - the aircraft on jacks, - the aircraft on its wheels, - the
aircraft on landing gear jacks. Load cells on each jack or platform
scales are used for weighing.
QUICK LEVELING PROCEDURE WITH THE ADIRU First, follow the Inertial
Reference (IR) alignment procedure. Then on the MCDU scratchpad the
alpha call-up code has to be entered: - PTCH for the pitch angle to do a
check of the longitudinal alignment, - ROLL for the roll angle to do a
check of the transverse alignment. To start this procedure, first of all
the aircraft must be lifted. After that, read the pitch and roll angles
in the MCDU scratchpad. Then operate the hydraulic jack below the wing
to get the transverse alignment. Then operate the forward hydraulic jack
to get the longitudinal alignment. When you have done the longitudinal
alignment, do a check of the transverse alignment.

leveling with a spirit level is an alternative method of leveling while
the ADIRUs are not available (no power supplied to the aircraft) and no
attitude monitors are installed. For this method two persons are
necessary: - one in the cargo compartment to move the spirit level, -
another one near the aircraft to operate the jacks. While the aircraft
is being lifted, put a spirit level on a track: - in the Y axis,
perpendicular to the tracks, and operate the hydraulic jack below the
wing to get the transverse alignment, - in the X axis, and operate the
forward hydraulic jack to get the longitudinal alignment. When you have
done the longitudinal alignment, do a check of the transverse alignment.

TOWING AND TAXIING (2) TOWING (continued) TOWING WITH THE NOSE GEAR FROM
THE FRONT This film describes how to push the A/C rearwards or tow the
A/C forwards with the nose gear. The A/C may be towed or pushed back: -
at maximum ramp weight, - with the engines shut down or running at idle.
To begin the procedure, make sure: - that the safety devices are
installed on the landing gears (L/G), - the wheel chocks are in place, -
and check if the parking brake is ON. Do not tow the A/C if the
dimension H is more than 300 mm (11.8 in). If you do, you can cause
damage to the internal centering cams of the nose landing gear (NLG).
Referring to your A/C maintenance manual, make sure that the A/C is
stable. Let us suppose that this procedure has been correctly done.
During this procedure, depending on the configuration you are in, the
A/C needs to be energized either by using the APU, a specific ground
cart, an engine running, or by using the tractor itself. Let us suppose
that the A/C is already energized and the EIS start procedure done.
Outside, on the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, set the
ground-towing control lever to the towing position and install the pin.
In the cockpit, - on the upper ECAM page, the "Nose.WHEEL STEERinG
DISConnected" message comes into view on the memo page. - check on the
Yellow brake-pressure triple-indicator that the accumulator pressure
pointer is in the green range. We recommend pressurizing the yellow
hydraulic system using the yellow electrical pump, thus, the braking
system will be more efficient and safer. Now, we have to install the tow
bar.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
CATTS LTD
CAUTION: Caution: make sure that the tow bar has: - a damping system - a
calibrated shear pin - two calibrated turn shear pins. This is to
prevent high loads causing damage to the L/G. Refer to your A/C
maintenance manual for the calibration of these pins. On the NLG,
install the tow bar on the tow fitting and connect the tow bar to the
tractor. CAUTION: Caution: put the parking brake control switch in the
off position before you tow or push back the A/C. This is to prevent
high loads causing damage to the NLG. On the Yellow brake-pressure
triple-indicator, the brakes pressure pointers go down. In the cockpit,
set the lighting system: - set the exterior light navigation and logo
switch to ON. - at night, set the interior light dome switch to bright
and if the anti-collision lighting is necessary for the local airport
regulations or the airline procedures, set the exterior light beacon
switch to ON. On the VHF system: - in order to communicate with the
control tower during towing operations, release out the VHF pushbutton
switch and select the control tower frequency on the radio management
panel. - in order to communicate with the ground mechanics, on the audio
control panel, set the interphone radio switch to the interphone
position and release out the interphone reception pushbutton. For safety
reasons, a distance of 3 meters (10 ft) must be kept clear around the
nose wheels, tow bar and tractor when the aircraft moves. Towing speed
limitation depends on the position of the passenger/crew and cargo
doors. For these speed limitations refer to your A/C maintenance manual.
Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 152 of 177
The maximum permitted steering angle on each side of the A/C centerline
is 95 degrees. At this point, be sure that all warnings and cautions of
your A/C maintenance manual procedure and previous precautions are
applied. Now, the A/C can be towed slowly and smoothly. Two other
persons have to monitor the wing tips during the towing operation and
one person is required in the cockpit in order to operate the brakes.
When you complete the towing operation, make sure that the nose wheels
are aligned with the A/C centerline. Inform the cockpit to apply the
parking brake, and check that the parking brake light is ON on the nose
wheel steering deactivation electrical-box. Put the wheel chocks in
position. Disconnect the tow bar from the nose gear fittings. On the
nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, remove the safety pin
and set the ground-towing control lever to the normal position. At the
same time, in the cockpit, on the ECAM memo display the message "N.WHEEL
STEERG DISC" disappears. On the lighting system: - reset the exterior
light beacon and navigation & logo switches to OFF. - reset the interior
light dome switch to OFF. On the communication system: - cut the
cockpit/control tower VHF link by pressing in the VHF pushbutton on the
radio management panel. - reset the interphone radio switch to the
neutral position. Depressurize the yellow hydraulic system, do the EIS
stop procedure and de-energize the A/C electrical circuits.

MAIN LANDING GEAR SHOCK ABSORBER SERVICING (3) MLG CONDITION CHECK
PROCEDURE Before you start to work on the landing gear, make sure you
have installed the safety sleeve on the lock-stay actuator and that you
have placed wheel chocks in position. In the cockpit make sure the
Landing Gear Control lever is in the down position. Place a warning
notice to prevent others from operating the control lever. NOTE: The
shock absorber must be examined for any leak or damage Measure the
dimension "H" of the sliding tube extension and measure the temperature
of the shock-absorber at the top charging valve. Compare the values with
the placard on the shock-absorber. If the result does not match the
measured values, you should adjust the nitrogen pressure. Unscrew the
cap and connect the pressure gauge hose to the top-charging valve and
open the valve in order to read the pressure at "A". Adjust the pressure
according to the temperature value given in the graph of the service
placard. Close the valve and release the pressure from the hose. Use a
second pressure gage to check the pressure at the bottom charging valve
at "B". Unscrew the cap and connect the pressure gage hose to the bottom
charging valve "B". Open the valve and read the pressure. Make sure the
pressure is 18 bar or 262 PSI higher than at the top charging valve "A".
Adjust the pressure if required. Close the bottom charging valve and
release the pressure from the hose. Disconnect the hose and reinstall
the protective cap. Open the top charging valve to adjust the pressure
and the final extension height to its correct value. Close the charging
valve and release the pressure from the hose. Disconnect the hose and
reinstall the protective cap again. Make sure that at the end of the
procedure the pressure at valve "B" and "A" are the same +/- 1,5 bar or
21,76 psi. Finally measure the dimension "H" of the sliding tube again,
to confirm the correct extension height and pressure adjustment.

NOTE: Frequent nitrogen filling of the MLG shock absorber can be an
indication of low oil level. Record all nitrogen servicing work in the
aircraft log. This will let you monitor if the fluid level check
Procedure is necessary. If the shock absorber has been fully deflated
and inflated again, it is recommended that you - do a check of the MLG
shock absorber charging pressure between four and seven days after the
first subsequent flight.
