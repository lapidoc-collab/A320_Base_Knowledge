ATIMS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) ATSU The Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU)
has been designed to take provision of all foreseen evolutions. The
modularity concept for the software (S/W) makes easy data link
capability during all Communication Navigation Surveillance and Air
Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) transitions. The ATSU S/W is partitioned
into two main parts: - aircraft interface/host platform and, - data link
applications.
AIRCRAFT INTERFACE/HOST PLATFORM SOFTWARE
-   hosted AOC applications. For the remote AOC applications, the ATSU
    only routes data to and from AOC peripherals. This routing is in
    charge of receiving ground messages and routing them to the right
    AOC peripheral and acquiring messages or reports from these
    peripherals and sending them to the ground. The hosted applications
    depend on airline definition and uploaded into the ATSU. These
    applications include standard and customized functions. The main
    functions are:
-   AOC menu display,
-   processing, printing and display of received messages,
-   generation, triggering and sending of messages.
The aircraft interface/host platform S/W is composed of four services: -
air/ground communication, used for the management of the air/ground
communication media, - Human-Machine Interface (HMI), used for the
management of the CNS/ATM cockpit interfaces: MCDU, printer and alert
function, - on-board peripherals, used for the management of the
communication with the on-board peripheral units: Data Management Unit
(DMU) part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU),
Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), Flight Management
System (FMS) and cabin terminal, - system management, used for the
acquisition of the aircraft parameters for application S/W use and
monitoring of the system: power supply and BITE functions.
DATA LINK APPLICATION The data link applications include only Airline
Operational Control (AOC) for the pre-Future Air Navigation System
(FANS) configuration. The AOC applications are dedicated to data
communication services between the aircraft and the airline facility.
The AOC is composed of: - remote AOC applications and,

ATIMS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) ATSU SOFTWARE LOADING The ATSU S/W is
uploaded via the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU). If a complete S/W
uploading is required, a de-selection of the ATSU data loading must be
carried out, for each type of S/W, so that a re-initialization of the
ATSU can be made until the DATALINK ATSU FAULT warning goes off on the
EWD.

ATIMS WARNINGS (3) DATALINK ATSU FAULT
VHF3 VOICE
When there is an Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) failure, the message
"DATALINK ATSU FAULT" appears on the EWD, in this case, MASTER CAUTion
light and Single Chime (SC) will be activated, and no SD page is called.
When VHF Data Radio (VDR) 3, configured in VHF DataLink (VDL) mode 2, is
not available for data transmission, the right memo "VHF3 VOICE" appears

ATSU ROUTER INIT &amp; TESTS THROUGH MCDU (2) INITIALIZATION PROCEDURE OF
THE ATSU ROUTER GENERAL This procedure, called initialization of the Air
Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) router, enables the air-ground
communications functions and services of the ATSU to be activated. Four
essential parameters are required: - A/C ICAO CODE (24bit address sent
by the ATC Transponders), - a valid airline identification (ACARS and
STANDARD A/L ID), - a valid A/C registration number (A/C REGISTR) and, -
a valid scan mask. Otherwise, the DATALINK ATSU FAULT+ ATSU INIT FAULT
amber warnings are displayed on the Engine/Warning Display (EWD). NOTE:
According to the pin programming activated on the Flight Warning
Computer (FWC) ("ACARS installed" or "ATSU installed"), the ACARS STBY
green memo is displayed instead of the DATALINK ATSU FAULT+ATSU INIT
FAULT warning.
A/C REGISTRATION NUMBER AND FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION The A/C registration
number is sent by the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU).
The ATSU creates the flight identification by concatenating the airline
identification parameter and the flight number parameter coming from the
Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC). The airline
identification is not available and must be entered.

mode, the ATC Transponders, and the Radio Management Panels (RMPs) for
communication system.
FMGC The ATSU sends data to both FMGCs on an ARINC 429 bus and receives
data from both FMGCs on another one. The ATSU/FMGCs interface is used
for: - Airline Operational Control (AOC) hosted application for
acquisition of operational data: origin/destination airport, flight
number, fuel on board, - remote AOC application to exchange AOC
messages, - air-ground communication functions: flight number, Flight
Management System (FMS), - system management and configuration to
exchange data link communication status and configuration between ATSU
and FMGCs.
MCDU
The ATSU sends and receives data from VDR3 through ARINC 429 links
for: - data block exchanges and, - status transmission. The ATSU sends 2
discrete signals to VDR3 to control: - VDR3 switching between voice and
data mode, - port select for VDR3 frequency selection. NOTE: VDR is
capable VDL mode 2 when "ATSU installed" pin programming is activated on
the FWC. The VDL mode 2 function is used to reduce channel saturation.
With this function, the rate throughput is increased ten times through a
D8-PSK modulation (31,5 Kbit/s).
SDU1
The ATSU sends data to MCDUs on an ARINC 429 bus and receives data from
MCDUs on another one. The ATSU/MCDUs interface is used for: - the AOC
application to select the AOC mode, parameter entry (captain name, fuel
units...), display of AOC specific information (AOC received messages,
scratchpad messages...), and print command, - air-ground communication

connected to the following systems: ATSU (only one HFDR connected).
ATSU acquires Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time and date from the
clock on an ARINC 429 bus. As back-up of the clock, the MMR2 transmits
the UTC time and date from a GPS source, on an ARINC 429 bus.
ATC XPDR
The ATSU/FDIMU interface is used for flight performance in uplink
request and downlink AIDS reports. The ATSU: - sends uplink requests to
the FDIMU (DMU-part) on an ARINC 429 bus and, - receives downlink
reports from the FDIMU on an ARINC 429 bus. The ATSU/CFDIU interface is
used to transmit the data given below to the CFDIU on an ARINC 429
bus: - information about internal or detected external failures of the
Air Traffic and Information Management System (ATIMS), - uplink
requests. The ATSU acquires downlink reports and data necessary for AOC
application from the CFDIU on an ARINC 429 bus. The ATSU/printer
interface is used to print data. The ATSU: - sends printable data to the
printer on an ARINC 429 bus and, - receives status information from the
printer on another ARINC 429 bus. The ATSU/MDDU interface is used for
loading data. The ATSU: - sends and receives loading data with the MDDU
or a PDL through 2 ARINC 429 buses, - receives status information from
the MDDU on a discrete line. The ATSU/AINS plugs/Laptop (optional)
interfaces are used for loading data through ETHERNET buses. The ATSU: -
sends loading data to the laptop by the AINS plugs for documentation
consultation modules (FCOM, MEL, FCTM, AFM ...) and/or performance
calculation modules (take off, landing, in-flight, weight and
balance), - receives requests from personnel in the cockpit through the
laptop connected to the AINS plugs. The ATSU/CVR interface is used for
data recording from the CVR.
The ATSU uses for the VDL2 function the ICAO code (24 bit address) sent
by the ATC transponders. The ICAO code is first extracted from the ATC
transponder 1 and then from the ATC transponder 2 if the ATC transponder
1 is not available.
RMP The ATSU sends 1 discrete signal to the 3 RMPs to indicate which
entity is controlling the VDR3. The ATSU receives only 1 discrete signal
from the 3 RMPs, which is used to request the mode switching to the
ATSU.
INDICATING AND RECORDING SYSTEMS/ATIMS INTERFACE For the indicating
system, the ATSU is interfaced with the Flight Warning Computers (FWCs),
the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs), the Display
Management Computers (DMCs), the Multi-Mode Receiver 2 (MMR2) and the
