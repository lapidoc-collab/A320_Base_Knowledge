PNEUMATIC SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The Pneumatic
system is used to supply High Pressure (HP) air for air conditioning,
pressurization, Fuel Tank Inerting System (FTIS), engine start and
anti-icing. HP air can be supplied from the two engines, the APU or an
external ground source.
But APU BLEED air can also be used in flight, in relation to the
altitude. The altitude can be different for each aircraft. These
altitude limits are given by the manufacturer. The APU bleed supply is
connected to the left side of the crossbleed duct. On the ground, a HP
ground power unit can be connected to the left side pneumatic system.
The right side can be supplied by opening the crossbleed valve.
ENGINE BLEED The engine bleed air receives pressure regulation and
temperature regulation before it is supplied to the pneumatic system.
Air is bled from two engine High Pressure Compressor (HPC) stages: the
Intermediate Pressure (IP) stage and the HP stage. The High Pressure
Bleed Valve (HPV) supplies air to the system when the engines are at low
power. When the IP bleed is sufficient, the HPV closes. The Pressure
Regulating Valve (PRV) is installed in the duct downstream of the IP and
HP bleed valves, and pneumatically regulates the downstream pressure.
Each Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC) monitors the system pressure and
will stop the engine bleed if the pressure is too high. An Overpressure
Valve (OPV) is also installed downstream from the bleed valve as a
protection of the system if the pressure is too high. The temperature of
the engine bleed air is regulated to a maximum value. The hot bleed air
goes through an air-to-air heat exchanger called the precooler. Fan
discharge air, modulated by the Fan Air Valve (FAV), is blown across the
pre-cooler to keep the temperature within limits.
APU BLEED/EXTERNAL AIR The left and right bleed systems are connected by
a crossbleed duct. A crossbleed valve is used for their interconnection
or isolation. The APU can also be used for bleed air supply. This is
usually done on the ground for air conditioning and for engine start.

ENGINE BLEED SYSTEM DESCRIPTION (3) PRV/CONTROL SOLENOID
B2 SCOPE CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY
AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE.
GENERAL The engine air bleed pressure is pneumatically regulated by the
High Pressure (HP) Valve (VLV) when air is supplied by the HP stage, or
by the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) when the air is supplied by the
Intermediate Pressure (IP) stage. The pressure regulation system is
monitored by two Bleed Monitoring Computers (BMCs).
HP VALVE Switching between IP and HP is done pneumatically when the IP
stage pressure is not sufficient (engine at low speed). The HP VLV
pneumatically regulates the air supply between 8 and 36 psi. The HP VLV
is forced to close when the PRV is closed via the PRV/HP VLV sense line.
In flight, the BMC for the A318/A319 fitted with CFM56 and PW6000
engines maintains the HP VLV closed. When the solenoid is de-energized,
the opening of the HP VLV is not inhibited. The solenoid will be
energized by the BMC when: - the engine is above idle, the pressure PS3
is greater than 110 psi for the PW6000 engines, or 80 psi for the CFM-56
engines, - the Wing Anti-Ice (WAI) is OFF, - the altitude is over 15,000
ft, - the pack configuration is normal.
IP CHECK VALVE
The PRV pneumatically regulates the bleed pressure around 44 psi. A
thermal fuse causes the valve to close in case of engine fire at 450°C
(842°F). The PRV is pneumatically controlled by an external
servo-control, the bleed pressure regulated valve control solenoid (CTL
SOL), located downstream from the precooler. The control solenoid
operates in two modes, pneumatic and electric, causing complete closure
of the PRV. The pneumatic mode is used for: - reverse flow protection -
the PRV is closed when a delta pressure between the precooler outlet and
the PRV inlet is detected. The electrical mode with PRV shut-off
function through energization of the control solenoid is used when: -
the ENGine BLEED P/B is selected "OFF", - the ENGine FIRE P/B is
RELEASED OUT, The solenoid is automatically energized by the BMC in the
following cases: - over-temperature downstream of the precooler - the
heat exchanger outlet temperature sensor senses a temperature above
257°C (527°F), - overpressure downstream of the PRV when the
pressure-regulated transducer senses a pressure greater than 57 psi, -
leak detection in pylon/wing/fuselage ducts and surrounding areas, - APU
bleed valve not closed, - corresponding starter valve not closed.
OPV The Overpressure Valve (OPV), which is normally open, closes
pneumatically. The OPV starts to close at 75 psi. It is fully closed at
85 psi and opens again at around 35 psi.
The IP check valve protects the IP stage from reverse flow when the HP
VLV is open.

REGULATED PRESSURE A transducer, connected to both BMCs, reads the
regulated pressure downstream from the PRV. This pressure is indicated
on the ECAM.
TRANSFERRED PRESSURE A transducer, connected to the related BMC, reads
the transferred pressure downstream from the High Pressure Valve (HPV).
This pressure is used to monitor the PRV and the HPV.
FAV/CONTROL THERMOSTAT The Fan Air Valve (FAV) pneumatically regulates
the fan airflow to the precooler for bleed air temperature regulation at
200°C (392°F). The FAV is pneumatically controlled by an external
servo-control: the FAV control thermostat (CTL THERMST), located
downstream from the precooler.
PRECOOLER The precooler is an air-to-air heat exchanger.
HEAT EXCHANGER OUTLET TEMPERATURE SENSOR The heat exchanger outlet
temperature sensor, connected to both BMCs, reads the regulated
temperature downstream from the precooler. This temperature is shown on
the ECAM and used to monitor the system. NOTE: Note: If the precooler
exchanger outlet temperature reaches 240°C (464°F), the BMC generates a
class 2 maintenance message - "AIR BLEED" - on the ECAM STATUS page. An
associated maintenance message "Thermostat (THRMST), FAV or sense line"
can be seen on the PFR, or on the MCDU.

APU BLEED AIR SPLY/X-BLEED SYSTEM D/O (3) B2 SCOPE CAUTION: MODULE
TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE
LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE.
APU BLEED The APU bleed air supplies the pneumatic system, through the
APU bleed valve, if the APU is running. The Bleed Load Valve for the APU
GTCP 36-300A (GARRETT) and the Load Control Valve of Honeywell APU
131-9A are electrically controlled by the ECB (solenoid) and
pneumatically operated. In the absence of air pressure or electrical
power, the valves are spring-loaded closed. The APU Bleed Control Valve
for the APIC APU is electrically controlled and fuel operated by a servo
valve. The Electronic Control Box (ECB) controls the servo valve and
fuel muscle pressure opens or closes the APU bleed valve. In the absence
of fuel pressure or electrical power, the valve shuts off the bleed
supply to the aircraft pneumatic system.
-   the secondary motor is used for manual operation. The X-BLEED
    selector on the overhead panel controls the position of the valve.
    OPEN position is used for:
-   left and right pack supply using single engine bleed,
-   left and right Wing Anti-Ice supply using single engine bleed,
-   left and right pack supply using ground air supply,
-   Engine crossbleed start using opposite engine bleed,
-   Engine 2 start using ground air supply. SHUT position is used to:
-   confirm automatic closure during bleed leak detection.
HP GROUND CONNECTION A ground cart may supply the pneumatic system. The
supply duct is located on the left hand side of the cross bleed valve.
Only the LH bleed system is supplied. When the X-BLEED selector is in
the OPEN position, the ground air supply will be available to supply the
LH and RH system together.
NOTE: These valves are of the ON/OFF type.
X-BLEED SYSTEM A ground cart may also supply the pneumatic system. The
ground air supply duct is connected to the left hand side of the
crossbleed duct. The crossbleed (X-BLEED) valve is an electrically
controlled shut-off valve operated by two electrical DC motors. The
X-BLEED valve is used to isolate or connect the left and right bleed air
systems: - the primary motor is used for AUTOmatic mode. The Bleed
Monitoring Computer (BMC) controls the position of the valve according
to the APU bleed configuration,

PNEUMATIC SYSTEM OPERATION (3) APU AIR BLEED SELECTION When the APU runs
and the APU BLEED P/BSW is released out, the supply air goes up to the
APU bleed valve which is closed. When the APU BLEED P/BSW is selected in
the ON position the APU bleed valve opens, the Pressure Regulator Valves
(PRVs) are maintained electrically closed and the X BLEED valve is
automatically opened, provided the X BLEED valve selector is in the
AUTOmatic position.

PNEUMATIC SYSTEM OPERATION (3) ENGINE AIR BLEED SELECTION When one
engine or both engines run and the APU runs, each PRV remains
electrically closed by the related Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC). When
both engines run, the APU continues to supply air as long as the APU
bleed valve remains open. When the APU BLEED valve P/BSW is released
out, the APU bleed valve closes, the X BLEED valve closes automatically
and the PRVs open.

B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE
LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE.
ROUTING The leak detection system is used to detect leaks in the
vicinity of the packs, wings, pylons and APU hot air ducts. Each wing is
monitored by a double loop. The pylon and APU hot air ducts are
monitored by a single loop. A continuous monitoring system detects
ambient overheat in the vicinity of the hot air ducts. Protected areas
with double loop for: - RH wing and pack 2, - LH wing, pack 1 and mid
fuselage APU duct. Protected areas with single loop for: - LH and RH
pylons, - AFT fuselage APU duct. NOTE: Each loop consists of sensing
elements connected in series.

Monitoring Computers (BMCs) receive signals from the leak detection
loops. They exchange data via an ARINC bus for the wing double loop
detection. NOTE: The wing loops A are connected to BMC 1 and wing loops
B to BMC 2. The crosstalk bus allows wing leak warnings to be activated
through an AND logic. The APU loop is connected to BMC 1 only. The pylon
loop is connected to the related BMC.

PNEUMATIC LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM D/O (3) FAULT LOGIC The ENG BLEED FAULT
light comes on when a leak is detected by the wing loops A and B or by
the pylon loop. The APU BLEED FAULT light comes on when an APU duct leak
is detected. If one BMC is failed, the adjacent BMC takes over
monitoring of the bleed system and ensures the following ECAM
warnings: - OVERPRESSure, - OVERTEMPerature, - WING LEAK. Nevertheless
the associated FAULT light on the AIR CONDitioning panel is lost, and
the associated bleed valve does not close automatically. The ENG BLEED
LEAK warning is lost for the associated engine as well as the APU BLEED
LEAK warning if BMC 1 is failed.

LEAK DETECTION The WING leak detection is a dual-loop system. To
generate a WING LEAK warning, both A and B loops have to detect the
overheat. For dispatch, WING leak detection must be operational (at
least one loop) on each wing. If a single loop fails, the MAINTENANCE
message AIR BLEED will be displayed on the STATUS page associated with a
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) message L(R) WING LOOP (INOP).
The aircraft may be dispatched per Minimum Equipment List with the
MAINTENANCE message displayed. For troubleshooting it is important to
understand that the WING detection elements monitor much more than just
the wings alone. The protected areas are: - wing leading edge (wing
anti-ice supply duct), - air conditioning compartment - belly fairing -
(pack supply, crossbleed manifold, APU supply, ground air supply), - APU
forward supply duct (from the APU check valve through the wheel well).

PNEUMATIC SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS TROUBLESHOOTING
NOTE Normal operation of the pneumatic system does not require electric
power. The HPV, PRV, OPV and FAV are all controlled and operated
pneumatically. The HPV, PRV, OPV and FAV are also connected to a
dedicated reference pressure pneumatic Thermostat or solenoid. During
troubleshooting, it is very important to check the integrity of all
pneumatic sense-line connections, in between the valves and its
thermostat or solenoid. The BMC monitors the system operation and shuts
down the system in case of over temperature, over pressure or a Leak.
The BMC BITE does not confirm the integrity of the system.

ENGINE START WITH GROUND AIR To perform an engine start with ground air,
the connection is located on the lower fuselage. The access door is on
the belly fairing. During a ground air start, the crossbleed valve must
be operated manually. For safety, it is recommended to use the ground
air supply to start the first engine. Then disconnect the ground air
supply and perform a crossbleed start for the second engine. On the ECAM
BLEED page, the GND indication DOES NOT indicate ground air supply
connected or available. This indication appears when the aircraft is on
the ground to show that the ground air is directly supplied to the LEFT
side of the system only. The left bleed system pressure indicator will
indicate pressure when the ground air is supplied.
