RADIO NAVIGATION FREQUENCY SELECTION (3) VOR 1 SELECTION THROUGH MCDU To
get the RADIO NAV page on the MCDU, the RADio NAVigation key must be
selected. When the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) auto
tunes the NAV receivers, the identifier, frequency and course (VOR only)
are shown in small font on the MCDU. The desired VOR 1 beacon indication
(AGN shown as example) can be manually inserted using MCDU keys. Then,
the selection must be transferred to VOR 1 using the corresponding line
select key, identifier will now be shown in big font. The related
frequency, found in the database is also displayed and tuned; the course
will now blank (between two brackets). The course is also inserted using
MCDU line keys (307 shown as example). The selection must be transferred
to CRS 1 using the corresponding line select key. When indications on
the MCDU are manually entered, they are displayed in big font.

RADIO NAVIGATION FREQUENCY SELECTION (3) VOR 2 SELECTION THROUGH RMP
This procedure is used as a backup operation only in case of failure of
both FMGCs, or failure of the MCDUs. Only the Radio Management Panel
(RMP) 2 allows the tuning of F/O side receivers. To activate the RMP
navigation keys, the guarded NAV key must be open and selected. The MCDU
RADIO NAV page is blocked and all tuning indications disappear. Then the
VOR key must be selected and a new VOR frequency can be tuned (114.8 MHz
shown as example). Selecting the transfer green key activates the new
frequency. The VOR operates on the just entered frequency but uses the
previous course. A new VOR course value must be entered (307 shown as
example) using the frequency selector knobs on the RMP. Selecting the
transfer green key prepares the RMP for a new VOR selection.

RADIO NAVIGATION FREQUENCY SELECTION (3) ADF 1 SELECTION THROUGH RMP
Only RMP 1 allows the tuning of CAPT side receivers. To activate the RMP
navigation keys, the guarded NAV key must be open and selected. Then the
Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) key must be selected, and a new ADF
frequency can be tuned (406.5 kHz) using the frequency selectors knobs
on the RMP 1. Selecting the transfer green key activates the new
frequency. It is possible to check the Morse identification of the radio
navigation stations using the ADF 1 knob on the Audio Control Panel
(ACP). When pressed, the related Morse signal can be heard and the audio
level can be adjusted by rotating the knob.

ADIRS PRINCIPLE (2) GENERAL The Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU)
comprises an Air Data Reference (ADR) system and an Inertial Reference
(IR) system, both included in a single unit. The ADIRU uses inputs from
external sensors: Angle Of Attack (AOA), Total Air Temperature (TAT),
and Air Data Module (ADM). The ADIRUs are interfaced with the Air
Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) Mode Selector Unit (MSU).

ADIRS PRINCIPLE (2) ADM FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION The ADM has a
microcomputer which processes an ARINC signal according to the discrete
inputs and to the digitized pressure.
ADM INPUTS The ADM inputs are one pressure input and several discrete
inputs. The ADMs are identical and fully interchangeable. The discrete
inputs determine the ADM location and the type of pressure data (Pitot
or static) provided to the ADR. The power supply for the ADM is a 13.5V
DC supply from the associated ADIRU.
ADM OUTPUTS The ADM output is an ARINC bus, which gives digital pressure
information, type of pressure, ADM identification and BITE status to the
ADIRU.

ADIRS PRINCIPLE (2) IR STRAPDOWN In a strapdown Inertial Reference
System (IRS) the gyros and the accelerometers are solidly attached to
the aircraft structure. The strapdown laser gyro supplies directly
accelerations and angular speeds.

ADIRS PRINCIPLE (2) RING LASER GYRO The three ring Light Amplification
Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) gyros, one for each rotation
axis, give inertial rotation data and are composed of two opposite LASER
beams in a ring. At rest, the two beams get to the sensor with the same
frequency. An aircraft rotation creates a difference of frequencies
between the two beams. The frequency difference is measured by optical
means providing an analog output, which is sent to an analog/digital
converter. After computation this output will provide rotation
information.

ADIRS PRINCIPLE (2) ACCELEROMETER Three accelerometers, one for each
axis, provide linear accelerations. The acceleration signal is sent to
an analog/digital converter. The digitized signal is then sent to a
processor, which uses this signal to compute the velocity and the
position.
IR COMPUTATION Each ADIRU computes the LASER gyro and the accelerometer
outputs to provide IR data to users.

AIR DATA PROBES PRESENTATION (2) STANDARD CONFIGURATION PITOT PROBES
Three Pitot probes provide total pressure to three Air Data Modules
(ADMs), which convert this pressure into digital format: ARINC 429.
ARINC words are then sent to the corresponding Air Data/Inertial
Reference Unit (ADIRU).
STATIC PORTS Six static ports provide static pressure to five ADMs,
which convert this pressure into digital format: ARINC 429. The two
standby static ports provide an average pressure directly to the standby
instruments, and to ADR 3 through a single ADM.
AOA SENSORS Each ADIRU receives Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) information from
its corresponding AOA sensor. The AOA sensors are also called Alpha
probes.
TAT SENSORS The three ADIRUs receive Total Air Temperature (TAT)
information from two TAT sensors. NOTE: The two TAT sensors are composed
of two sensing elements. ADIRU 3 receives the TAT from TAT sensor 1 one
only.
WATER DRAIN The probes are installed in such a way that their pressure
lines do not require a water drain, except for that of the standby
static ports.

ADIRS SWITCHING (2) GENERAL The Air Data/Inertial Reference System
(ADIRS) is composed of three Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs).
PRINCIPLE Various instruments and systems receive data from the ADIRS
for inertial and air data display: - the PFDs, - the NDs, - the ECAM
SD, - the Digital Distance and Radio Magnetic Indicator (DDRMI). The
ADIRUs transmit air data, attitude and navigation parameters to various
user systems. As an example, the ADIRS provides: - barometric altitude
data to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system for mode C and S, - data to
the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) for computation of various
characteristic speeds, - data to the Weather Radar (WXR) system for
antenna attitude stabilization. Basically, ADIRU 1 is associated with
systems 1 and the DDRMI, ADIRU 2 with systems 2, and ADIRU 3 is in
standby. ADIRU 3 can substitute either system, for this purpose it has
interfaces with the three Display Management Computers (DMCs). If an Air
Data Reference (ADR) or an Inertial Reference (IR) fails, the AIR DATA
or ATTitude HeaDinG selectors enable the crew to use ADR 3 or IR 3. The
manual switching is mainly performed to recover displays. The computers
select their inputs according to the switching for consistency of
computation and display. NOTE: The ADIRU data sent to the ECAM SD are
Static Air Temperature (SAT), Total Air Temperature (TAT) and
International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

ADIRS ALIGNMENT THROUGH MCDU (2) GENERAL The Air Data and Inertial
Reference System (ADIRS) has three identical Air Data and Inertial
Reference Units (ADIRUs), one ADIRS Mode Selector Unit (ADIRS MSU) and a
number of sensors. The ADIRUs receive information from the sensors to
compute air and internal laser gyros and the accelerometers to compute
inertial data. This data is displayed to the crew and sent to the MCDU
and other A/C systems. The sensors also send data to the Integrated
Standby Instrument System (ISIS) for standby display.

ADIRS ALIGNMENT THROUGH MCDU (2) ADIRS - ALIGNMENT BATTERIES TEST NOTE:
Note: There is no specific ADIRS battery.
ALIGNMENT OF THE IRS The Flight Management Guidance and Envelope System
(FMGES) uses the reference point coordinates of the departure airport to
align the Inertial Reference System (IRS). It automatically finds these
coordinates in the database after the operator enters a company route or
an origin-destination city pair and pushes the ALIGN IRS key on the
MCDU. The operator can manually adjust these coordinates to the gate
position. The time necessary for a full alignment is 10 minutes. It is
necessary to do a specific alignment procedure between 73°and 82° north
or south (refer to FCOM documentation). The alignment procedure is not
possible at more than 82° north or south.

ADIRS ALIGNMENT THROUGH MCDU (2) ADIRS - ALIGNMENT (continued) AUTOMATIC
ALIGNMENT BY GPS (OPTION) With the latest ADIRUs, an optional automatic
alignment by GPS position is possible. With this initialization by GPS,
no operator action is necessary. Less than 1 minute after the ADIRS is
set to NAV, the INIT page displays the GPS position, but does not
display the ALIGN IRS prompt message. The time necessary for a full
alignment will be between 5 and 10 minutes in relation to the local
latitude and a maximum of 17 minutes between 73° and 82° north or south.
If the operator enters a company route or an origin-destination city
pair, the INIT page displays the departure airport reference-point
coordinates, and the IRS ALIGN prompt message comes into view. If the
prompt key is not pushed, the ADIRS will be aligned on the GPS position.
If the prompt key is pushed, the ADIRS will be aligned on the reference
point coordinates of the departure airport. The operator can also use
the MCDU latitude and longitude keys of the INIT page to change the
given aircraft position. This will cause the ALIGN IRS prompt key to
come into view. This prompt key must then be pushed.

ADIRS ALIGNMENT THROUGH MCDU (2) ADIRS - ALIGNMENT (continued) FAST
REALIGNMENT During transit or en-route stops with short ground times,
the flight crew can do a fast realignment with the selector, which must
be turned from NAV to OFF and then back to NAV in less than 5 seconds.
The Inertial Reference (IR) starts a 30-second realignment with existing
attitude, heading angles and velocities set to zero. NOTE: Note: The
ALIGN IRS prompt will come into view and must be pushed to do the
alignment. With the optional automatic alignment by GPS, the procedure
is the same but no pilot entry is necessary (no action necessary on the
ALIGN IRS prompt).

ADIRS ALIGNMENT THROUGH MCDU (2) INTERRUPTION DURING ALIGNMENT EXCESSIVE
MOTION If taxiing or towing causes a step input that is more than a
specified threshold, alignment or fast realignment is stopped and then
the ADIRUs start a 10-minute alignment again. Step input threshold: 0.5
ft/s, 30 seconds after the detection of movement, and if no other
movement occurs, a 10-minute alignment starts.
NOTE: Note: If the test is done two times, one after the other, and the
test results are not correct, the IRS detects a fault situation
(indications on MSU and EWD). If this occurs, set the ADIRUs to OFF,
wait for 20 seconds and try to do a full alignment again.
NOTE: Note: It is not necessary to re-initialize the position if already
entered.
TEST OF STORED POSITION When the initial position is entered, the ADIRUs
do a check to find if this position is within a threshold of the
computed position, which was stored at the last ADIRU shutdown. If not,
an MCDU message "REALIGN IRS" is displayed to enter the present
position. Test threshold: 1° for latitude and longitude during
alignment, 0.5° during fast realignment. NOTE: Note: If the result of
the test for the new position is not correct, the system waits for
another position entry. If the same position (out of the threshold) is
entered two times, the ADIRUs accept it as a deliberate choice.
TEST OF COMPUTED LATITUDE At the end of the alignment, the ADIRUs do a
check to find if the entered latitude is within a threshold of the
self-computed latitude. If not, an MCDU message "REALIGN IRS" is
displayed to enter the present position. When a new position is entered,
the IRS alignment is necessary. If the test result is correct for this
position, the alignment is completed.

ADIRS ALIGNMENT THROUGH MCDU (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS In some conditions, if
you do not know the airport point coordinates, a long time can be
necessary for the alignment of the ADIRS and for the maintenance task
(for example, if the GPS is not available and you are not at your usual
airport). To find easily the local data for longitude and latitude (to
align the ADIRS), you can print out the Post Flight Report (PFR). On the
PFR header, you usually find the origin-destination city pair. Enter the
4 letters of the destination city, via the MCDU scratchpad line, in the
"FROM" and "TO" fields of the INIT page, e.g. "KFJK/KJFK". Then push the
ALIGN IRS prompt key.

ISIS INTERFACES (3) OUTPUTS
CONNECTORS DESCRIPTION On the back of the Integrated Standby Instrument
System (ISIS) there are two pressure connections and one electrical
connector. To avoid "cross connection" the pressure connectors are keyed
and color-coded: Red for total pressure and yellow for static pressure.
The electrical connector is for power supply, pin programming and
systems interface. The normal power supply is 28V DC from the DC
ESSential BUS. If DC ESS BUS is not available, a back-up of 28V DC is
automatically supplied from the HOT BATtery BUS if airspeed is greater
than 50 kts.
All the data received and computed by the ISIS is sent to the Flight
Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) through one ARINC 429
high-speed bus for inertial data transmission and one low-speed bus for
anemometric data transmission. One discrete output is used for
fault/healthy indication. In case of a fatal failure of the ISIS the red
message OUT OF ORDER associated with the related fault code is shown.
PERIPHERALS INPUTS The ISIS receives data from several systems. Via
ARINC 429 buses the ISIS is connected to: - the Instrument Landing
System (ILS) or Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) for localizer and glide slope
signals, - the Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) 1 and 3 for the
reception of the optional magnetic heading data. An ARINC 429 input is
reserved as system provision (not shown). Through discrete inputs the
ISIS receives signals: - from the ATTitude HeaDinG selector switch on
the SWITCHING panel for selection of active ADIRU 1 (normal mode) or 3
(alternate mode), - for the display of the optional reference BAROmetric
pressure in inches of mercury in addition to the reference BARO in
hectopascals, - for the display of the optional altitude value in meter
in addition to the altitude value in feet, - which enable to change the
basic aircraft symbol by the V-bars symbol as an option, - for the ISIS
indicator face tilting (4 discretes), - for parity control of all the
discretes.

MMR SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL The Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) system
is a navigation sensor with 3 internal receivers: MMR = ILS + GPS.
ILS PRINCIPLE The function of the ILS is to supply to the crew and
airborne system users, signals transmitted by ground stations. A descent
axis is determined by the intersection of a Localizer beam (LOC) and a
Glide Slope beam (G/S) created by these ground stations at known
frequencies. The ILS can measure and display angular deviations and it
also receives the Morse audio signal, which identifies the ILS ground
stations.

MMR SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GPS PRINCIPLE The NAV System Time And
Ranging (STAR) GPS is a worldwide navigation radio aid which uses
satellite signals to provide accurate navigation information. The
architecture of the system is composed of 3 parts called segments: -
spatial segment, - control segment, - user segment.
SPATIAL SEGMENT The spatial segment is composed of a constellation of 24
satellites. These satellites are arranged in six separate orbital planes
of four satellites each on a circular orbit. These orbits have the
following characteristics: - 55° inclination to the Equator, - an
altitude of approximately 20.200 km with an orbital period of 12
sidereal hours. These satellites give: - the satellite position
(ephemeris of the constellation), - the constellation data (almanach), -
the atmospheric corrections.

MMR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) (GPS 2) by means of the ATT HDG
selector switch (13FP) to preserve side 1/side 2 segregation (GPS
1/ADIRU 1/FMGC 1 and GPS 2/ADIRU 3/FMGC 2 architecture). In case of
failure of two ADIRUs, the two FMGCs use only the operative ADIRU. This
ADIRU receives data from its own side GPS (e.g. ADIRU 1. GPS 1).
GENERAL The Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) system includes: - 2 MMR units, -
1 dual Glide Slope (G/S) antenna, - 1 dual Localizer (LOC) antenna, - 2
GPS antennas.
MANUAL TUNING
ILS FUNCTION
From each MCDU both MMR units can be manually tuned through their onside
FMGC.
AUTO TUNING In normal operation, the GPS 1 data are used by the Air
Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) 1 and 3; the GPS 2 data by the
ADIRU 2. In order to reduce GPS initialization time, the GPS 1 (2)
receives data from the ADIRU 1(2). The Inertial Reference (IR) portion
of the ADIRU 1(2) gives to the FMGC 1(2): - pure IR data, - pure GPS
data (in this case the ADIRU operates as a relay), - hybrid GPIR data.
The FMGC 1(2) uses the hybrid GPIR 1(2) data for position fixing
functions. The pure GPS data are used for display on the MCDU 1 and 2.
In case of one GPS failure, the three ADIRUs automatically select the
only operative GPS to compute hybrid GPIR data. In case of one ADIRU 1
failure, the FMGC 1 uses ADIRU 3/GPS 1 data. In case of one ADIRU 2
failure, the FMGC 2 uses ADIRU 3/GPS 2 data. The primary source of ADIRU
3 being the GPS 1, it is necessary to select the secondary input port of
the ADIRU 3
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
NOTE: To return to the auto-tuning mode, the manual mode has to be
cleared.
BACK-UP TUNING In case of failure of both FMGCs, a back-up tuning is
provided by RMP 1 and 2. Either RMP controls both MMR units, if NAV mode
is activated by selecting NAV key on RMP 1 and 2. In this mode, the RMP
1 can control the MMR 2 through the RMP 2, which can control the MMR 1
through the RMP 1. NOTE: RMP 3 is not used for navaids tuning. In
emergency electrical configuration only RMP 1 is supplied.
ANTENNAS The dual G/S and dual LOC antennas are common to both MMR
units. Each antenna has two independent connectors, for each MMR units.
GPS FUNCTION
CATTS LTD
GPS OPERATION The GPS function is achieved by two stand-alone satellite
navigation sensors using the US GPS satellites constellation. The GPS
primary
Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 83 of 209
FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY
function is to track the Radio Frequency (RF) signals received from the
satellites, to compute its own position and to provide the GPS data to
the FMGCs through the three ADIRUs. Receiver Autonomous Integrity
Monitoring (RAIM) or Autonomous Integrity Monitoring Extrapolation
(AIME) provides integrity and availability of this data. The GPS
function provides three-dimensional aircraft position, velocities and
exact time used for hybrid computations by the three ADIRUs. In case of
failure of one GPS function, the ADIRU automatically selects the only
operative GPS function to compute hybrid GP-IRS data.
NOTE: As long as GPS/IRS mode is active, radio updating DME/DME or
VOR/DME is not allowed.
LGCIU Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a
ground/flight discrete signal, which is used by the receiver BITE module
to count the MMR internal flight legs.
ANTENNAS The GPS antenna is an L-band active antenna, with an integrated
preamplifier and filter, providing an omni-directional upper hemispheric
coverage. The GPS antenna operates at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz called
L1. A second frequency of 1227.6 MHz, called L2, is used to estimate the
propagation error of L1 and to suppress it.
ADIRU To reduce initialization time, MMR unit 1 and 2 receive position
data (latitude, longitude), time and date from the associated ADIRU. In
case of failure of ADIRU 2 the primary source of ADIRU 3 being GPS 1, it
is necessary to select the second input port of ADIRU 3 (GPS 2) by means
of the ATTitude/HeaDinG selector knob on the SWITCHING panel to preserve
the side 1/side 2 segregation: - MMR 1 provides data to FMGC 1 through
ADIRU 1, - MMR 2 provides data to FMGC 2 through ADIRU 3.
FMGC The Inertial Reference (IR) portion of ADIRU 1 or 2 provides FMGC 1
or 2 with pure IR data, pure GPS data and hybrid GP-IRS data for
position fixing. The FMGC position is a mix of the hybrid GPS/Inertial
Reference System (IRS) position.

out on the MMR system using the MCDU. The test can be done only on
ground.
USERS The MMR data is sent to the FMGCs for aircraft guidance during
take off, approach and landing phases. The MMR data is also sent to the
ECAM for warnings. The MMR 1 data is send to the Enhanced Ground
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) for mode 5 computation (descent below
G/S). NOTE: A discrete signal sent by the FMGC inhibits any frequency
change in the MMR unit when LAND mode is armed below 700 ft.
INDICATING The ILS 1 data is sent, through the Display Management
Computers (DMCs), to the CAPT PFD and F/O ND and the ILS 2 data is sent
to the F/O PFD and CAPT ND. An audio signal is also processed by the MMR
unit (ILS part) and sent to the Audio Management Unit (AMU) so that it
can be heard by the crew. Pure GPS data is available for display on the
GPS MONITOR page of the MCDUs. Operational messages may also be
displayed on the NDs.

WXR/PWS SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL The airborne Weather Radar (WXR)
and Predictive WindShear system (PWS) detects and localizes atmospheric
wet disturbances and windshear events in the area scanned by the
antenna.
WXR PRINCIPLE The WXR helps the pilots to avoid these areas and the
related turbulences by determining their range and bearing. It can also
be used for ground mapping. The radar emits microwave pulses through a
directive antenna, which receives the return signals that are the
echoes. The distance is determined by the time necessary for the echoes
to come back. The azimuth is given by the antenna position when the echo
is received.

WXR/PWS SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) WXR INDICATING RDR-4000 has a new
3D-Buffer technology, in which antenna scanning is not related to
Navigation Display (ND). The system will continuously scan the
atmosphere in front of the aircraft from 0 to 60,000 ft. In automatic
mode, RDR-4000 sends data about all detected weather cells to the ND.
The cells that are not in the vertical flight path of the aircraft
(called OFF PATH weather cells) are shown on the ND with hatched colors.
The cells that are in the vertical flight path of the aircraft (called
ON PATH cells) are shown in solid colors. The pilots can also select an
altitude layer that will be extracted and displayed on the ND. This is
the constant elevation mode that is used for weather cell analysis. When
the system starts, a delay of 30 seconds is necessary before the 3D
buffer is filled. There is a new display OFF mode which removes weather
echo from the ND while the system scans the atmosphere and updates its
3D buffer. The weather radar image is shown independently on the CAPT
and F/O NDs. The ND also shows mode messages related to the mode CAPT
and F/O selection on the control panel (the CAPT mode selection is shown
on the CAPT ND, the F/O selection is shown on the F/O ND). The colors
used to show the disturbance intensity are: - black, green, yellow and
red to show different precipitation rates, - magenta to show the
turbulence areas (maximum 40 NM).
PWS INDICATING The predictive windshear indications and warning/caution
alerts are shown on the CAPT and F/O PFDs and NDs. The windshear
phenomenon is indicated by an icon superimposed on the radar image in
the different EFIS modes, ARC and ROSE except in PLAN mode.

WXR/PWS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) between the transceiver and the
antenna, via a wave-guide. The antenna scans a 180° sector in azimuth
and has a tilt coverage of + or - 15°. An internal circuit of the
transceiver fulfils the antenna stabilization. The stabilization data
is: Pitch and roll angles, selected tilt, antenna azimuth and elevation
angle.
GENERAL (SINGLE INSTALLATION) The Weather Radar (WXR) and Predictive
WindShear (PWS) System is composed of: - 1 control panel, - 1 WXR
transceiver (XCVR), - 1 antenna assembly, - 1 wave-guide.
SYSTEM INTERFACES
NOTE: The PWS installation is optional.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION CONTROL UNIT The control unit gives the modes of
operation, antenna tilt and gain of the receiver digitized information,
via an ARINC 429 bus. An ON/OFF discrete fulfils the energization of the
transceiver, which in turn supplies the control unit and the antenna
assembly.
WXR XCVR The WXR XCVR uses the principle of radio echoing to detect the
level of precipitation, the ground map, and the principle of Doppler
effect to detect the turbulence areas. The transceiver operates in
X-Band frequency at 9345 MHz. It digitizes the video signals on two
ARINC 453 data buses connected to the Display Management Computers
(DMCs) for display on the NDs. The PWS function also uses the principle
of Doppler effect to detect windshear events. Horizontal and vertical
wind velocity and aircraft true airspeed are the different windshear
components for the determination of the windshear threshold.
ADIRU The WXR receives, from Air Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs)
1or 3, pitch and roll data, for the stabilization and control of the
antenna, and ground speed for Doppler mode correction. The ADIRU, which
provides data, is selected by means of the ATTittude/HeaDinG selector
switch. The PWS function receives data from ADIRU 1or 3 for velocity
calculations: - true airspeed, - altitude (or corrected altitude), -
east/west and north/south velocity ground speeds, - track angle, - true
heading, - and magnetic heading.
LGCIU The Landing Gear Control Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends
ground/flight and landing gear extended information to the transceiver.
This discrete signal is used by the receiver BITE module to count the
flight legs. The landing gear extended signal is used to determine if
the A/C is taking-off or landing to generate the aural warning
message: - GO AROUND, WINDSHEAR AHEAD in approach, - Or WINDSHEAR AHEAD,
WINDSHEAR AHEAD at take-off.

QUALIFIERS A AND B SIGNALS (IF PWS INSTALLED) Two types of qualifier
inputs are required to enable automatic activation of the windshear
function. - Qualifier type A: 2 qualifiers are used (QA1 and QA2).
Provided by the Air Traffic Control (ATC)/Traffic Collision Avoidance
System (TCAS) control unit, which indicates the position of the
AUTO/ON/STBY switch. Qualifier A is valid when AUTO or ON is selected. -
Qualifier type B: 2 qualifiers are used (QB1 and QB2). Provided by the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU) 1 and 2, which indicate a normal engine oil
pressure. Qualifier B is valid when the engine is running (high oil
pressure). The windshear function is automatically activated below 2300
ft RA and one of each qualifier A and one of each qualifier B have to be
valid.
RA (IF PWS INSTALLED) The RA gives the altitude information through an
ARINC 429 bus. This data is used for automatic activation, together with
the two (A &amp; B) qualifiers, of the windshear function.
AUDIO INHIBIT SIGNALS (IF PWS INSTALLED) These discretes are used to
indicate whether the aural alert output has to be active or not. - PWS
aural alerts (discrete input) are inhibited by the reactive windshear
and stall warning from the Flight Warning Computers (FWCs), - PWS
discrete output is used to inhibit aural alerts generated by TCAS or
Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) or other FWC warnings.

EGPWS The EGPWS receives PWS alerts from the radar hazard bus to
determine the priorities. Alert priorities are: - WXR/PWS warning, -
WXR/PWS caution, - Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) terrain
warning, - GPWS terrain caution.
INDICATING The WXR XCVR is connected to the DMCs by means of two ARINC
453 buses. Each data bus wiring is terminated at one end by a low
inductance resistor (68 ohms) to avoid a signal return. The WXR image is
shown on the CAPT and F/O NDs when ROSE or ARC mode is selected on the
EFIS control panel. The windshear events are shown on the CAPT and F/O
NDs and all visual alerts on the CAPT and F/O PFDs for caution or
warning alert (Advisory is only shown on NDs). NOTE: When both EFIS
control panels are in PLAN mode, the WXR/PWS transceiver is
de-energized.

WXR/PWS OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS (2) SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS Some special
precautions must be taken before using the Weather Radar (WXR) system on
ground in MAP, WX or WINDSHEAR mode. - the dangerous zone forward of the
aircraft must be free of metallic obstacles such as hangars or aircraft,
within 5 m in an arc of + or - 90º on either side of the aircraft
centerline, - make sure that nobody is within a distance of 1.5 m from
the antenna, in an arc of + or - 135º on either side of the aircraft
centerline, - the system must not be operated during the refueling of
the aircraft or during any refueling operation within 100 m. Note:
Although the power radiated by the system is low, the above written
safety precautions should be observed for obvious routine reasons
(behavior with respect to other types of radar systems). To avoid
radiating danger, and nuisance aural alerts the WINDSHEAR AUTO/OFF
selector switch must be selected OFF independently of the radar selector
switch.

RADIO ALTIMETER SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) PRINCIPLE The Radio Altimeter
(RA) system calculates the height of the aircraft above the terrain
during initial climb, approach and landing phases. The RA can therefore
operate over non-flat ground surface. The principle of the RA is to
transmit a frequency-modulated signal, from the aircraft to the ground,
and to receive the ground reflected signal after a certain delay. The
time between the transmission and the reception of the RA signal is
proportional to the A/C height.

RADIO ALTIMETER DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
USERS
The RA system is made of two independent systems and has: - two
transceivers with associated mounts and fans, - two transmission
antennas, - two reception antennas.
The RA information is sent to various systems through ARINC 429 buses.
The system users are: - Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS)
for terrain warnings, - Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs)
for processing data, - Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) for call out
indications and warnings, - ELevator Aileron Computers (ELACs) for
integration into various flight parameters.
TRANSCEIVER The RA transceiver measures the radio height of the aircraft
in relation to the ground. The transceiver operates in a frequency range
of 4.200 to 4.400 MHz.
EIU
ANTENNA The RA system includes two identical transmission and reception
antennas. The operating range of the antenna according to the aircraft
attitude is limited to + or - 30° for pitch and roll.
FAN
LGCIU
Each RA transceiver is cooled by an associated fan, attached under the
transceiver mount. A capacitor is mounted on the fan case in order to
suppress the parasites.
INDICATING
The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) provides the
flight/ground information, which is used by the transceiver BITE module
to count the flight legs.
CFDIU
In normal operation, RA 1 provides the radio height to the CAPT PFD and
RA 2 to the F/O PFD through the Display Management Computers (DMCs). In
case of one transceiver failure the DMC automatically switches to the
other one. The radio height information appears on the PFDs when less
than or equal to 2.500 ft.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
The Engine Interface Unit (EIU) 1(2) sends a ground discrete to the RA
1(2) to inhibit the test on ground when the associated engine N2 rating
(high-pressure compressor rotational speed) is greater than minimum idle
rating.
The MCDUs allow the systems to be tested via the Centralized Fault
Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). The tests are only available on ground.

TCAS PRESENTATION (2) RA VOLUME
PRINCIPLE The Traffic and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is a system
whose function is to detect and display aircrafts in the immediate
vicinity and to provide the flight crew with indications to avoid these
intruders. The Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) is
an optional system, which ensures the same functions as the TCAS.
When the intruder represents a collision threat, the TCAS (or T2CAS)
triggers an aural and visual alarm known as Resolution Advisory (RA),
which informs the crew about avoidance maneuvers.
NOTE: The TCAS II provides indications to avoid these intruders by
changing the flight path in the vertical plane only. The TCAS detects
the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system or TCAS equipped aircraft and
maintains surveillance within a range determined by its sensivity. To
evaluate threat potential of other aircraft the system divides the space
around aircraft into 4 volumes.
OTHER TRAFFIC VOLUME The other traffic volume is the first volume
providing the presence and the progress of an intruder. The aircraft
detected in this zone does not represent a collision threat.
PROXIMATE TRAFFIC VOLUME The proximate traffic volume is defined by a
given volume around the TCAS (or T2CAS) equipped aircraft. The aircraft
detected in this zone does not represent a collision threat, but is
declared in vicinity.
TA VOLUME When the intruder is relatively near but does not represent an
immediate threat, the TCAS (or T2CAS) provides aural and visual
information known as Traffic Advisory (TA). The TCAS (or T2CAS) aural
messages can be inhibited depending on higher priority aural messages.

TCAS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
COMPUTER
The Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) includes: - 1
control unit common with Air Traffic Control (ATC) system, - 1
computer, - 2 antennas (1 top and 1 bottom).
The TCAS computer ensures two main functions: - a transmission/reception
function for intruder acquisition, - a processing function for operation
control: Digital, discrete and analog types interfaces, intruder
trajectory computation and tracking, visual and aural alert commands.
NOTE: As an option, the Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System
(TCAS) part of the Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System
(T2CAS) can replace the TCAS.
ANTENNA The TCAS (or TCAS part of theT2CAS if installed) directional
antennas provide azimuth information on aircraft located within the TCAS
(or T2CAS-TCAS) surveillance range. They transmit at 1.030 MHz and
receive at 1.090 MHz. The phase and amplitude of the received signal
depend on the direction of the signal source, which permits the relative
bearing of the transmitting aircraft to be determined.
SUPPRESSOR The TCAS (or T2CAS-TCAS if installed), ATC, and the Distance
Measurement Equipment (DME) operate in the same frequency range. A
suppressor signal is transmitted, via a coaxial, by the operating system
to inhibit the other systems and to prevent simultaneous transmission.
CONTROL PANEL The operating modes of the TCAS (or T2CAS-TCAS if
installed) are selected on a common ATC/TCAS control panel. The TCAS (or
T2CAS-TCAS if installed) information is transmitted to the TCAS (or
T2CAS) computer via the ATC transponder.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
ATC The operative ATC mode S transponder transmits response to ATC
ground station interrogations and data to the TCAS: Barometric altitude,
TCAS mode from control panel, TCAS broadcast messages. The Mode S
transponder permits communication between the TCAS and a TCAS equipped
and detected aircraft through the communication link function for
exchanging coordination messages.
RADIO ALTIMETER The RA transceivers provide radio height used as
reference to determine the computation sensitivity level and trigger the
inhibit orders. The radio height is used in the 0 to 2.500 ft range.
ADIRU The Inertial Reference (IR) part of the Air Data/Inertial
Reference Unit (ADIRU) provides the magnetic heading and the pitch and
roll attitude information to the TCAS (or T2CAS) computer. NOTE: The
barometric altitude is transmitted via the ATC transponder.

CFDIU The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) allows
testing and trouble-shooting of the TCAS (or T2CAS if installed) through
the MCDU. The tests are only available on ground.
LGCIU The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) provides a
flight/ground signal used by the BITE module for flight leg counting. It
provides also a landing gear extended signal for TCAS (or T2CAS)
operation.
-   all traffic/threat traffic display,
-   ground display mode (TA mode),
-   number of intruders displayed (8 maximum),
-   aircraft altitude limit (48.000 ft).
DATA LOADER It will be possible to load software data into the TCAS (or
T2CAS) computer by means of a data loader. The remote loading capability
is linked by 2 ARINC 429 low speed buses to a dedicated connector in the
aircraft.
INDICATING Visual indications are presented on the NDs and PFDs. The NDs
present the location of intruders in the traffic area. The PFDs present
the avoidance maneuver indications on the vertical speed scale. The
Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) monitor the validity of the information.
Synthesized voice announcements generated by the TCAS (or T2CAS)
computer and broadcast by the loudspeakers accompany the visual
indications.
INHIBITION Various discrete signals are used for inhibition by equipment
with higher priority than the TCAS (or T2CAS). These priorities are: -
Stall, - WindShear, - Predictive WindShear (PWS), - Enhanced Ground
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) messages.
PIN PROGRAMMING Some pin programs define the operating mode of the TCAS
(or T2CAS). Operating mode: - audio level output,

EGPWS PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning
System (EGPWS) is built over the current Ground Proximity Warning System
(GPWS). EGPWS = GPWS + "ENHANCED" functions. As an option, the Traffic
and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can be installed instead
of the EGPWS. The T2CAS includes partitioned modular functions for both
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and Terrain Awareness and
Warning System (TAWS) functions. The TAWS part of T2CAS carries out the
same functions as the EGPWS.
-   basic GPWS functions (Modes 1 to 5), mainly based on Radio Altitude,
-   predictive modes: Collision Prediction and Alerting (CPA) function
    and Terrain Hazard Display (THD) function, which gives
    forward-looking terrain avoidance and premature descent alert
    functions.
PRINCIPLE The purpose of the EGPWS is to help prevent accidents caused
by Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). When the limits of an alerting
envelope are exceeded, aural alert messages, visual annunciations and
displays are generated. The basic GPWS modes generate aural and visual
warnings that correspond to an aircraft behavior when the alert envelope
is penetrated. The "ENHANCED" functions added to the basic GPWS modes
are: - Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF): Increases the terrain clearance
envelope around the airport runway. NOTE: With the optional geometric
altitude function, the EGPWS can operate reliably in extreme local
pressure or temperature variations from standard. - Terrain Awareness
alerting and Display (TAD): Includes a terrain database to predict
conflict between flight path and terrain and to display the conflicting
terrain. NOTE: The EGPWS can also include an obstacle database in which
are recorded the man-made obstacles. They are treated as terrain. The
alerting functions integrated in the T2CAS-TAWS part are:

EGPWS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL The Enhanced Ground Proximity
Warning System (EGPWS) has: - 1 Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning
Computer (EGPWC), - 2 PULL UP/GPWS P/BSWs with integral lights, - 1 GPWS
control panel, - 2 TERRain ON ND P/BSWs. As an option, the Terrain
Awareness and Warning system (TAWS) part of the Traffic and Terrain
Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the EGPWS. The T2CAS
computer is a single Line replaceable Unit (LRU) for both Traffic
Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and TAWS functions. All cockpit
hardware interfaces (lights, P/BSWs) for the T2CAS-TAWS remain identical
to the EGPWS. The interfaces are also identical for the TAWS peripheral
systems.
DIGITAL INPUTS The EGPWS receives ARINC 429 data inputs from the
navigation sensors in order to monitor the aircraft position with
respect to the terrain and provide audio and visual warnings when in
hazardous situation.
DIGITAL OUTPUTS An ARINC 429 transmitter provides a maintenance output
data bus. This output bus is used by the Centralized Fault Display
Interface Unit (CFDIU) for maintenance purposes and by the Aircraft
Integrated Data System (AIDS) for the Data Management Unit (DMU), part
of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU).
ENHANCED FUNCTIONS The EGPWC outputs a display of terrain data in ARINC
453 data bus format to the Display Management Computers (DMCs). The
terrain data is displayed on the NDs automatically instead of the radar
image when a terrain caution or warning is detected or any time by using
the TERR
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
ON ND P/BSWs. The EGPWS receives the Predictive WindShear (PWS) alerts
from the weather radar hazard bus to determine the priority. The PWS has
priority over EGPWS modes. The EGPWC uses preferably GPS position, then
IRS latitude and longitude data as valid position source and, if these
positions are downgraded, then FMS position will be used. Two
architectures are available to receive GPS data. The first one uses the
ADIRS connection as GPS data are transmitted via the IR1 bus, and the
second one will use a direct connection between EGPWC and MMR1 if ADIRU1
is not able to transmit GPS data.
EGPWS CONTROLS Various P/BSWs let the crew control the actions of the
EGPWS. When pressed in, on the GPWS control panel: - the TERR P/BSW with
the white OFF legend, inhibits the Terrain Awareness Display (TAD) and
the Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) modes, - the SYStem P/BSW with the
white OFF legend, inhibits all the GPWS warnings (mode 1 to 5), - the
Glide/Slope MODE P/BSW with the white OFF legend, inhibits the G/S mode
(mode 5), - the FLAP MODE P/BSW with the white OFF legend, inhibits flap
abnormal condition input (mode 4) and generates the green "GPWS FLAP
MODE OFF" memo on the left memo area of the EWD, - the LanDinG FLAP 3
P/BSW with the white ON legend selects the landing FLAP 3 position and
generates the green "GPWS FLAP 3" memo on the right memo area of the
EWD. When pressed in, the PULL UP GPWS P/BSW on the instrument panels
has two functions: - it sends a ground signal to trigger the self test
sequence, - it cancels the G/S aural and visual warnings when triggered.
When the TERR ON ND P/BSW is pressed in, on the center instrument panel,
the green ON legend comes on to indicate that terrain data is shown on
the ND.

AURAL WARNINGS
LGCIU
The audio output is used to broadcast aural warning messages, which
identify the activated mode. When the EMERgency CANCel key on the ECAM
Control Panel (ECP) is pressed, an audio suppression signal is sent to
the EGPWC in order to momentarily cancel the EGPWS warnings.
The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a
flight/ground discrete signal to the EGPWC BITE to count the flight
legs. This discrete is also used for Mode 4: Unsafe terrain clearance.
VISUAL WARNINGS In hazardous flight configurations or system failures,
the EGPWC sends discretes for the lighting of warning legends. Five
discretes control the warning legends: - one for red PULL UP legends,
comes on red when the second boundary of Mode 1 is penetrated or when
Mode 2, or any TAD or TCF alert is activated, - one for amber GPWS
legends, comes on amber when any other mode is activated. - two monitor
outputs for the amber FAULT legends on the SYS and TERR P/BSWs of the
GPWS control panel. These discretes are also sent to the System Data
Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) to generate the ECAM "GPWS FAULT" and
"GPWS TERR DET FAULT" warning messages, - one monitor output for the
availability of the terrain mode. In case of Flight Management System
(FMS) low accuracy a green TERR STBY is sent through the SDACs to the
right memo area of the EWD.
FWC The Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) send a discrete to the EGPWC to
inhibit all warnings when a stall or windshear warning is triggered. The
EGPWC sends two discretes to the FWCs and the Traffic alert and
Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) in order to inhibit auto call out and
low speed warnings and change TCAS mode from Resolution Advisory (RA) to
Traffic Advisory (TA) when the PULL UP or GPWS warnings are in progress.
These discretes are also used by the Digital Flight Data Recorder
(DFDR).

EGPWS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) T2CAS The following alerting function
are integrated in the T2CAS-TAWS part: - basic GPWS functions (Modes 1
to 5), mainly based on Radio Altitude, - predictive modes: Collision
Prediction and Alerting (CPA) function and Terrain Hazard Display (THD)
function, which provides a forward-looking terrain avoidance and
premature descent alert functions. NOTE: The basic GPWS modes 1 and 2
are automatically inhibited when CPA and THD functions are operating.
Optionally, an automatic deactivation of predictive function upon
navigation high/low accuracy criteria can be activated, if the TAWS
logic uses the Flight Management System (FMS) 1 lateral position. When
this option is activated, the predictive mode is deactivated if the
navigation accuracy is low. The green "TERR STBY" ECAM memo is displayed
and mode 1 and 2 are reactivated. The Ground Collision Avoidance Module
(GCAM) ensures a very low rate of nuisance alerts to keep the crew
confident in the generated alerts. It addresses some specific situations
such as situations of normal aircraft operation according to procedures
at altitudes significantly below the surrounding local terrain height
(approaches in steep valleys). If GCAM predicts that the A/C can not
climb over the terrain with sufficient safety margin: - the aural "AVOID
TERRAIN" warning is triggered, - visual black crosses are displayed in
the solid red on the ND. NOTE: The T2CAS is not compatible with the
weather radar autotilt function for ground clutter suppression.

EGPWS MODES (3) GENERAL The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System
(EGPWS) (or T2CAS-TAWS if installed) computes and compares the aircraft
behavior with a predetermined envelope.
WARNING MODES When the warning envelope is penetrated, visual and aural
warnings are generated. The aural messages are broadcast through the
cockpit loudspeakers and visual warnings are indicated by the PULL UP
Ground Proximity Warning System P/BSWs lights. A terrain image is
displayed on the NDs. A number of airports through the world have
approaches or departures, which are not entirely compatible with the
standard GPWS operation. These airports are identified in the database,
the GPWS recognizes them and modifies the profile and triggers the
warning in accordance.

EGPWS MODES (3) MODE 1 Mode 1 provides an alert warning for high descent
rates into terrain and for rapidly increasing sink rates near the runway
when landing. [ Mode 1 has two boundaries. Penetration of the first
boundary generates a repeated "SINK RATE" aural alert and causes both
GPWS lights to come on. Penetration of the second boundary generates a
repetitive "PULL UP" aural alert and causes both PULL UP lights to come
on.

EGPWS MODES (3) MODE 2 Mode 2 provides a warning based on the radio
height and on how rapidly the radio height decreases. It has two areas
of application known as mode 2A and 2B. - 2A: Flaps not in landing
configuration, and aircraft not on the glide slope beam. Penetration of
the boundary causes the GPWS lights to come on, and generates the
repeated aural alert: "TERRAIN". After "TERRAIN" has sounded twice, the
warning switches to "PULL UP", repeated continually until the aircraft
leaves the warning envelope. In addition, the PULL UP lights come on.
After the aircraft leaves the boundary, the PULL UP lights stay on and
the "TERRAIN" aural message persists. These alerts stop when the
aircraft increases either the barometric or inertial altitude by 300
feet. - 2B: Flaps in landing configuration. Lowering the flaps to the
landing position automatically switches GPWS to mode 2B. In this case
lower boundary varies between 200 feet and 600 feet depending on
altitude rate. In ILS approach (glide slope deviation \&lt;± 2 dots) the
lower boundary is fixed at 30 feet. When the aircraft enters the
envelope, the alert is the same as for mode 2A. When gear and flaps are
in the landing configuration, the aural message is "TERRAIN" only and is
not followed by "PULL UP" if the aircraft remains in the envelope. When
the enhanced GPWS functions and the optional geometric altitude function
are of high integrity, the upper operational limit is reduced.

EGPWS MODES (3) EGPWS/T2CAS DIFFERENCES The EGPWS and T2CAS have
different philosophies. The EGPWS keeps all modes active but
desensitizes nuisance prone modes function of the predictive mode (TAD)
integrity and aircraft location (through envelope modulation). The T2CAS
inhibits mode 2 when the Collision Prediction and Alerting (CPA) is in
normal operation and the CPA altitude crosscheck is correct. The EGPWS
sensor includes a vertical margin (terrain floor) function of Vz and
Runway proximity. This margin is directly applied on the terrain cells
for T2CAS. The EGPWS and T2CAS both use a caution and a warning sensors
projected in a terrain database. EGPWS assumed that the A/C could climb
6° all the time. The T2CAS takes into account real time aircraft climb
capability to give an alert with guaranteed safety margins. If this
safety margins is not sufficient, the AVOID TERRAIN alert is triggered
to indicate to the pilot that a turn maneuver is recommended in addition
to the PULL UP warning. The EGPWS and the T2CAS have very similar
display principles (same layer colorations). Both systems have an
anticipated background display in descent (approximately 30 sec). The
T2CAS has one specific feature, which is the AVOID TERRAIN display.

a selected ground station. The system generates interrogation pulses
from an onboard interrogator and sends them to a selected ground
station. After a 50 microseconds delay, the ground station replies. The
interrogator determines the distance in nautical miles between the
station and the aircraft. The interrogator detects the Morse audio
signal, which identifies the ground station.

DME DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
SUPPRESSOR
The DME system includes: - 2 DME interrogators and, - 2 DME antennas.
The DME, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the Traffic Alert and
Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) operate in the same frequency range. A
suppressor coaxial between the ATC transponders, the TCAS and DME
interrogators is necessary to prevent simultaneous transmission and to
interrupt reception of the other systems.
AUTO TUNING In normal operation each Flight Management and Guidance
Computer (FMGC) automatically tunes its ownside DME interrogator through
its ownside Radio Management Panel (RMP) via port A. With failure of one
FMGC the other FMGC can control the DME interrogators, one directly, the
other through its RMP. When the FMGC fails, the DME receives a discrete
signal through the RMP to automatically select port B.
AMU
MANUAL TUNING
LGCIU
From each MCDU both DMEs can be manually tuned through their ownside
FMGC (via port A).
Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a discrete
signal to the associated DME interrogator. This is a ground/flight
information used by the receiver BITE module to count the flight legs.
BACK-UP TUNING
INDICATING
In case of dual FMGC failure the RMPs enable back-up tuning.
ANTENNA The DME antenna transmits the DME interrogation and receives the
reply from the selected ground station. The DME antenna operates within
the low band from 962 MHz to 1213 MHz (1041 to 1150 MHz for
interrogation and 962 to 1213 MHz for reply).
USERS
The DME audio signals are transmitted to the Audio Management Unit (AMU)
and then dispatched to the headsets and/or loudspeakers. The pilot can
adjust the volume of the DME ground station by pressing the VOR P/B on
the Audio Control Panel (ACP) or the LS P/B in case of collocated
ILS/DME (if LS mode is selected on EFIS control panel).
DME data is sent to the NDs and the PFDs through the Display Management
Computers (DMCs) and directly to the optional Digital Distance and Radio
Magnetic Indicator (DDRMI).
CFDIU The MCDUs allow the systems to be tested and trouble shooting to
be performed via the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU).
The tests are only available on ground.
The DME data is sent to the FMGCs for radio distance computation.

transponder is an integral part of the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon
(ATCRB) system. The transponder is interrogated by radar pulses received
from the ground station. It automatically replies by a series of pulses.
These reply pulses are coded to supply: - aircraft identification (Mode
A), - automatic altitude reporting (Mode C) and, - selective calling and
transmission of flight data of the aircraft on the ground controller's
radar scope. These replies enable the controller to distinguish the
aircraft and to maintain effective ground surveillance of the air
traffic. The ATC transponder (Mode S) also responds to interrogations
from aircraft equipped with a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance
System (TCAS). NOTE: As an option, the Traffic and Terrain Collision
Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the TCAS.

return, receives status data. The ATC/TCAS control panel converts
selected mode and selected code data into digital data and transmits
this data in ARINC 429 format to the selected transponder. In order to
monitor the ATC transponders and generate alerts by the Flight Warning
System (FWS), the ATC/TCAS control panel is connected to the System Data
Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) by two discretes connections. The
Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) provide a
ground/flight discrete signal to the ATC transponder via the ATC/TCAS
control panel for BITE purposes.
TRANSPONDER In normal operation, one ATC transponder operates and the
other is in standby mode. The operating mode (A, C or S) of the
transponder is determined by the decoding of the time between the
interrogation pulses. The main function of the mode S transponder is
surveillance. Each
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
transponder has its own and unique address coded on 24 bits so that
every interrogation can be directed to a specific aircraft preventing
multiple replies. The mode S is also used in collision avoidance (TCAS).
NOTE: The links between the ATC and the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU),
the Flight Control Unit (FCU) and the Inertial Reference (IR) part of
the Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) are optionally installed
for enhanced surveillance/extended squitters. The links between the MMRs
are for extended squitters only.
ANTENNAE The ATC antennae transmit replies to interrogations from the
ATC ground station. Top and bottom antennas provide the antenna
diversity features that allow a better radar coverage. The antenna
operates in the 960 MHz to 1.220 MHz frequency band with an
interrogation frequency of 1.030 MHz and a reply frequency of 1.090 MHz.
SUPPRESSOR The ATC, the DME and the TCAS operate in the same frequency
range. A suppressor signal is transmitted, via a coaxial, by the
operating system to inhibit the other systems and to prevent
simultaneous transmission.
ADIRU ADIRU 1 and ADIRU 2 provide barometric altitude to associated
transponders for mode C. In case of failure of ADIRU 1 or 2, the pilot
can switch to ADIRU 3 through the AIR DATA selector switch.
FMGC The Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) provide the
flight number. This data will be transmitted to an ATC ground station
after a mode S interrogation.

CFDIU The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) allows
testing and trouble-shooting of the ATC system through the MCDUs. The
tests are only available on ground.
TCAS The TCAS allows individual communications with each TCAS equipped
aircraft through the Mode S transponder. This enables a coordination of
avoidance maneuvers by acquisition, at regular intervals, of the
relative altitude and the separation range. NOTE: As an option, the
Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the
TCAS.
CONDITIONS TO TRANSMIT ADS-B PARAMETERS ON AIRBUS A320 FAMILY The
Automatic Dependant Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) application is hosted
by the transponder. On Airbus A320 family, there are conditions to
transmit ADS-B parameters: - an Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) wiring
provision (basic), - transponders capable of Elementary Surveillance
(ELS)/EHS/ADS-B (compliant DO-260), - a Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) from
any vendor or Global Positioning System Sensor Unit (GPSSU) from
Honeywell. NOTE: No need of pin programming to activate ADS-B data
transmission. Need certification for operational use if required by
regulation. For the retrofit aircraft of the A320 family, an Airbus
Service Bulletin for ADS-B OUT certification is available: SB 34-1418.
But, for the forward fit aircraft of the A320 family, the ADS-B OUT
certification is proposed as an option on production aircraft:
CN.34.52.117 / 02.

ADF SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) PRINCIPLE The ADF is a radio navigation aid.
It provides: - the relative bearing of the aircraft to a selected ground
station called Non-Directional Beacon (NDB), - an aural identification
of the ground station. The relative bearing is the angle between the
aircraft heading and the aircraft/ground station axis. The combination
of signals, received from two loop antennas and from one
omni-directional sense antenna, provides bearing information. The ground
stations operate in a frequency range of 190 kHz to 1.750 kHz. An
additional Morse signal is provided to identify the selected ground
station.

ADF DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) The ADF ground stations operate in a
frequency range of 190 kHz to 1.750 kHz divided into two parts: - NDB:
190 kHz to 550 kHz, - standard commercial broadcast AM stations: 550 kHz
to 1.610 kHz.
GENERAL The ADF system includes: - 2 identical ADF receivers, - 2
identical ADF antennas.
LGCIU
NOTE: ADF 2 system is optional.
Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends discrete
signals to the associated ADF receiver. This ground/flight information
is used by the receiver BITE module to count the flight legs.
AUTO TUNING In Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) approach each Flight
Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) automatically tunes its ownside
ADF receiver through its ownside Radio Management Panel (RMP). With
failure of one FMGC, the other FMGC can control the two ADF receivers,
one directly, the other through its RMP. When the FMGC fails, the ADF
receives a discrete signal through the RMP to automatically select port
B.
INDICATING
MANUAL TUNING
NOTE: Some DDRMIs are not equipped with the ADF capability.
From each MCDU both ADFs can be manually tuned through their ownside
FMGC.
CFDIU
BACK-UP TUNING
The MCDUs allow the systems to be tested and trouble shooting to be
performed via the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). The
tests are only available on ground.
In case of dual FMGC failure, the RMPs enable back-up tuning.
The ADF data is sent to the NDs through the Display Management Computers
(DMCs) and directly to the optional Digital Distance and Radio Magnetic
Indicator (DDRMI). The ADF audio signal is processed by the receiver and
sent to the Audio Management Unit (AMU) and can be heard by the crew.
ANTENNAS The ADF antenna provides three signals and consists of one
sense antenna and two loop antennas called longitudinal antenna and
lateral antenna. The ADF antenna comprises: - one pre-amplifier, for
each antenna, supplied by the ADF receiver in +/- 12V DC, - a test loop,
which enables a self-test.

VOR/MKR SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) VOR PRINCIPLE The VOR system is a
medium-range radio navigation aid. The VOR system receives, decodes and
processes bearing information from the omni-directional ground station,
working in the frequency range of 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz. The ground VOR
station generates a reference phase signal and a variable phase signal.
The phase difference between these signals, called bearing, is function
of the aircraft position with respect to the ground station. The bearing
is the angle between the magnetic north and the ground station/aircraft
axis. Furthermore, the VOR station provides a Morse identification,
which identifies the station.

VOR/MKR DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
MKR CONTROL
The VOR and MKR system includes: - 2 identical VOR/MKR receivers (only 1
MKR system is installed on aircraft), - 1 dual VOR antenna, - 1 MKR
antenna.
The system consists of two identical VOR/MKR receivers but only MKR one
is operative as it is connected to the MKR antenna. The MKR system
operates at a fixed frequency and does not need any control.
VOR AUTO TUNING
The MKR antenna receives MKR signals when the aircraft flies over the
MKR beacons. The MKR antenna operates at 75 MHz.
In normal operation each Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC)
automatically tunes its ownside VOR receiver through its ownside Radio
Management Panel (RMP) via port A. With failure of one FMGC, the other
FMGC can control the two VOR/MKR receivers, one directly, the other
through its RMP. When the FMGC fails, the VOR receives a discrete signal
through the RMP to automatically select port B.
VOR MANUAL TUNING
MKR ANTENNA
AMU The pilot can adjust the volume of the VOR ground station and MKR
beacon identification signals using the VOR and MKR P/Bs on the Audio
Control Panel (ACP). Selected VOR ground station and MKR beacon
identification audio signals are transmitted to Audio Management Unit
(AMU) and then dispatched to the headsets and/or loudspeakers.
LGCIU
From each MCDU both VORs can be manually tuned through their ownside
FMGC.
VOR BACK-UP TUNING
Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends discrete
signals to the associated VOR receiver. This ground/flight information
is used by the receiver BITE module to count the flight legs.
In case of dual FMGC failure, the RMPs enable back-up tuning.
