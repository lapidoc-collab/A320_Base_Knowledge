FLIGHT CONTROLS SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The
control is achieved through the following conventional surfaces.
PITCH Two elevators and the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS)
achieve the pitch control. Elevators are used for short-term activity.
The THS is used for long-term activity.
ROLL Roll control is achieved by one aileron and spoilers 2 to 5 on each
wing, numbered from wing root to wing tip.
YAW The rudder does the yaw control. The rudder is used during cross
wind take-off and landing, and in case of engine failure (thrust
asymmetry). The yaw damper function controls the rudder for Dutch roll
damping and turn coordination.
SPEED BRAKES The speed brake function is used in flight to increase the
aircraft drag. Spoilers 2 to 4 are used. Roll orders and speed brake
orders are added with priority given to the roll function.
GROUND SPOILERS The ground spoiler function is used to destroy the lift
during landing and in case of aborted take-off. All spoiler panels are
used.
AILERON DROOP The aileron droop function increases the lift on the part
of the wing which has no flaps. The ailerons are deflected downwards
when the flaps are extended.

FLIGHT CONTROLS SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) The flaps lever selects
simultaneous operation of the slats and flaps. The five lever positions
correspond to the surface positions as shown on the graphic.
SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) HIGH LIFT Slats and flaps achieve the high
lift function. There are two flaps, inboard and outboard, and five slats
on each wing, numbered from wing root to wing tip. The A321 has double
slotted flaps. The slats and flaps are electrically controlled and
hydraulically operated. Two Slat Flap Control Computers (SFCCs) do the
control and monitoring. Each computer has one slat and one flap channel.
The slat and flap systems are similar. A Power Control Unit (PCU) drives
each system with two hydraulic motors coupled to a differential gearbox.
Torque shafts and gearboxes transmit the mechanical power to the
actuators, which drive the surfaces. Each motor is powered by a
different hydraulic system and has its own valve block and Pressure Off
Brake (POB). Valve blocks control the direction of rotation and the
speed of their related PCU output shaft. The POB locks the transmission
when the slat and flap surfaces have reached the selected position or if
hydraulic power fails. Wing Tip Brakes (WTBs) are given in order to stop
and lock the system when major failures are detected. They are
hydraulically activated and can only be reset on ground. Position
Pick-Off Units (PPUs) send slat and flap position feedback to the SFCCs
and ECAM. Flap sensors installed between inboard and outboard flaps
inhibit further flap operation when a flap attachment failure is
detected. The signal is sent to the SFCCs via the Landing Gear Control
and Interface Units (LGCIU). To prevent an aircraft stall, slats cannot
be fully retracted at high angles of attack or low speeds (Alpha/speed
lock function). The FLAPS lever has five positions: 0, 1, 2, 3 and FULL.
Two configurations correspond to position 1: Configuration 1 and
Configuration 1+F. These are selected as shown on the graphic.

FLIGHT CONTROLS SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW
(continued) ACTIVE SERVO CONTROLS There are two servo controls for each
aileron, for each elevator and for the yaw damping function. In normal
configuration, one servo control actuates the surface. It is called
active servo control. The second, which follows the surface deflection,
is in damping mode. When only manual pitch trim is available, the
centering mode is applied to the elevators. The actuators are
hydraulically maintained in neutral position.
RECONFIGURATION PRIORITIES In normal configuration, the following
computers do the servoloop control. The arrows indicate the actuation
reconfiguration priorities in case of computer failure or loss of
hydraulic circuits.

SIDE STICK DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL The main function of the
side sticks is to transmit to the Electrical Flight Control System
(EFCS) the lateral and longitudinal manual control orders in the form of
electrical signals, depending on the position of the hand grip. It also
generate the related artificial feel loads using spring rods, springs
and dampers. In autopilot mode, a solenoid is energized in order to keep
the side sticks in the neutral position. By doing this, the solenoid
provides a higher load level in order to prevent any unwanted switching
to the manual control mode, while keeping the possibility to override
the autopilot if required. A thermoformed polycarbonate casing houses
the mechanical assembly to prevent the penetration of foreign matter,
which could jam the moving parts. Two identical transducer units are
associated to each computer, one for roll control, another one for pitch
control. A transducer unit comprises sets of potentiometers driven by a
duplicate mechanism and connected to the EFCS computers via connectors.
Ring pins can be installed for adjustment WARNING: During handling, make
sure that the side stick assembly stays in vertical position. There is a
risk of skydrol leakage from dampers.

SIDE STICK DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) SIDE STICK AND PRIORITY LOGIC Side
sticks, one on each lateral console, are used for manual pitch and roll
control. They are springloaded to neutral. When the autopilot is
engaged, a solenoid-operated detent locks both side sticks in the
neutral position. If the pilot applies a force above a given threshold
(5daN in pitch, 3.5 daN in roll), the autopilot disengages and the side
stick unlocks and sends an input to the computers. The hand grip
includes 2 P/Bs: An autopilot disconnect/side stick priority P/B and a
push-to-talk button. Side stick priority logic: When only one pilot
operates the side stick, his demand is sent to the computers. When the
other pilot operates his side stick, in the same or opposite direction,
both pilot inputs are algebraically added. The addition is limited to
single-stick maximum deflection.
NOTE: If one stick is deactivated on ground, at takeoff thrust
application, the takeoff «CONFIG» warning is triggered.
NOTE: In the event of simultaneous inputs on both side sticks (2°
deflection off the neutral position in any direction), the two green
SIDE STICK PRIORITY lights, on the glareshield, come on and the "DUAL
INPUT" voice message activates. A pilot can deactivate the other side
stick, and take full control by pressing and keeping pressed his
takeover P/B. For latching the priority condition, it is recommended
that the takeover P/B be pressed for more than 40 seconds. The takeover
pushbutton can then be released without losing priority. However, a
deactivated side stick can be reactivated at any time, by momentarily
pressing either takeover P/B. If both pilots press their takeover P/Bs,
the last pilot to press their P/B will have priority. NOTE: If an
autopilot is engaged, any action on a takeover P/B will disengage it. In
a priority situation, a red light will come on, in front of the pilot
whose side stick is deactivated. A green light will come on, in front of
the pilot who has taken control, if the other side stick is not in the
neutral position (to indicate a potential and unwanted control demand).

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) PRINCIPLE A side stick or an autopilot sends an
electrical signal to the flight control computers for an aircraft
maneuver. The flight control computers process the demand and send it to
the control surfaces. The processing uses pre-set limitations and
instructions called LAWS. In normal law, regardless of the pilots'
input, the computers will prevent excessive maneuvers and make sure the
safe envelope is not exceeded in pitch and roll axes. The rudder control
is designed as on a conventional aircraft. Normal law is modified
depending on the phase of flight. It operates in 3 modes: - Ground mode:
operates on the ground when the aircraft is electrically and
hydraulically powered. There is a direct relationship between the side
stick and the control surfaces. - Flight mode: operates in the air after
a gradual transition from ground mode just after lift-off, - Flare mode:
modifies the flight mode to give a conventional "feel" to the landing
phase. In normal LAW, when the aircraft is in flight mode, the control
surface deflection is not directly proportional to the side stick
deflection. A side stick deflection gives a rate demand to the flight
control computers, which set control surface deflection to meet the rate
demand. For the same side stick input, the control surface deflections
will be large at low speed and small at high speed. A side stick input
is a rate of roll demand in roll and a load factor (g) demand in pitch.
Yaw control is conventional. The response information is fed back to the
flight control computers. The computers process this feedback and adjust
the control surface deflection to ensure that the maneuver rate demand
is achieved accurately. This means that control surface deflections may
be altered with no change in side stick position. When in flight mode,
if you wish to perform a descending left turn for example, you must set
the required attitude and then return the side stick
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
to neutral. The neutral side stick position requires zero rates of pitch
and roll. The flight control computers will maintain the set attitude
until you use the side stick to ask for an attitude change. During the
entire maneuver, there is no need for pilot trim inputs.
Installation of THS cable cover Prevention of flight control law
reversion and loss of flight envelope protections Unexpected water
dripping from floor could lead to ice accretion close to rudder and THS
cables. This may prevent cables from moving freely through pressure
seals and eventually lead to STABILIZER JAM condition associated to
reversion in alternate law. SB 27-1286 (for CEO A/C) and SB 27-1287 (for
NEO A/C). To avoid blockage of the THS cables leading to the loss of THS
mechanical control with THS frozen in position.

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) NORMAL LAW Normal law provides a number of
airborne pitch protections. They are: - Load factor limitation, - Pitch
attitude protection, - High angle of attack protection, - High speed
protection. In lateral control, there is only one protection, which is
for bank angle. NOTE: Note: Turn co-ordination and "Dutch roll" damping
are automatically provided in normal law. Pilot inputs on the rudder
pedals are not required.
LOAD FACTOR LIMITATION Load factor limitation prevents structural
overstress by a limitation of the control surface deflections through
the flight control computers. Full side stick movement is always
available. The load factor is automatically limited to: - (+) 2.5 g to
(-) 1 g in clean configuration, - (+) 2 g to 0 g in other
configurations.

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) NORMAL LAW (continued) PITCH ATTITUDE PROTECTION
If the aircraft reaches the pitch attitude protection nose up limits,
then the flight control computers will override pilot demands and keep
the aircraft within the safe flight limits. The pitch attitude
protection limits are shown as small green dashes on the Primary Flight
Display (PFD). The pitch up values are different depending on the
aircraft configuration and speed between 30 and 20 degrees up. The nose
down limit is 15 degrees.

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) NORMAL LAW (continued) HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK
PROTECTION The high Angle Of Attack (AOA) protection is designed to
prevent a stalling of the aircraft and to ensure optimum performance in
extreme maneuvers, for example windshear or Enhanced Ground Proximity
Warning System (EGPWS) warning recovery. This protection takes priority
on all others. This protection displays information on the side of the
PFD speed scale. Under normal law, when the angle of attack becomes more
than PROT, the system changes from normal mode to protection mode: The
side sticks controls directly an angle of attack. NOTE: Note: V PROT and
V MAX may be different because they are G-load sensitive. When the speed
decreases, V PROT reaches VLS, which is the lowest speed that can be
selected with the autothrust engaged. A low energy warning, repeated
every 5 seconds, indicates to the pilot that the aircraft energy becomes
lower than a threshold. Under this threshold, the thrust must be
increased to recover a positive flight path angle through pitch control.
The low energy warning is available in the following conditions: - Above
100 ft RA and - Below 2,000 ft RA and - In conf 2, 3, FULL and - Not in
TOGA, ... With autothrust inoperative or not engaged, the speed can
reduce to the first level of AOA protection, V PROT, which is shown at
the top of the amber / black band (barber pole). If engaged, the
autopilot will disconnect. Nose up pitch trim is inhibited below V PROT.
The flight control computers will maintain V PROT if the side stick is
released.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
CATTS LTD
The floor protection is usually available from lift-off down to 100 ft
RA. A/THR is automatically activated and commands TOGA thrust when the
aircraft angle of attack is above a pre-determined threshold. This is
indicated by an "A FLOOR" indication on the Flight Mode Annunciator
(FMA) and also on the Engine Warning Display (EWD). If the pilots
override V PROT with the side stick, the speed can reduce to V MAX. In
normal law, the flight control computers will maintain V MAX, even if a
pilot holds a side stick fully aft. In this protection range, the normal
law demand is modified and side stick input is an AOA demand, instead of
a load factor demand. If the pilot releases the side stick at V MAX, the
speed will return to V PROT and will be maintained.

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) NORMAL LAW (continued) HIGH SPEED PROTECTION The
high speed protection is designed to prevent the aircraft from exceeding
maximum speed. These protection limits are displayed on the PFD speed
scale. VMO/MMO is shown at the bottom of the red/black barber pole.
Green dashes indicate the speed at which the protection is activated.
When the airspeed/Mach increases above VMO/MMO, an overspeed ECAM
warning is triggered (refer to Autoflight chapter). If the airspeed/Mach
increases to the protection activation speed: - The autopilot disengages
and, - The flight control computers send a pitch up command to the
control surfaces to prevent more acceleration. The side stick authority
is reduced, but the flight control computers will permit this speed to
be exceeded momentarily for maneuvering if necessary. With stick
released, the speed will return to VMO/MMO.

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) NORMAL LAW (continued) BANK ANGLE PROTECTION
Under normal law, bank angle protection limits the angle of bank to 67
degrees, shown by green dashes on the PFD. If the pilot holds full
lateral side stick, the angle of bank will increase and maintain 67
degrees. The Flight Director (FD) on the PFD will disappear if the angle
of bank exceeds 45 degrees. If the side stick is released at any time
when the bank angle exceeds 33 degrees, the aircraft will return to and
maintain a 33 degrees bank angle. The FD will be displayed again on the
PFD when the angle of bank reduces to less than 40 degrees. The autotrim
is inhibited above 33 degrees. With the angle of attack protections
active: - The bank angle is limited to 45 degrees and no more. With the
high speed protection active: - The system maintains a positive spiral
stability to 0 degree bank angle, so that if the side stick is released,
the aircraft returns to wing level. The bank angle limit is also reduced
from 67 to 40 degrees.

FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS (3) LOAD ALLEVIATION FUNCTION (LAF) The Load
Alleviation Function (LAF), which operates through the ailerons, becomes
active in turbulence conditions and during maneuvers (pilot control
authority is not modified). This function decreases the wing structure
loads. The LAF becomes active when the vertical load factor becomes more
than 1.3 g or less than 0.7g. When this occurs, there is an upward
deflection (order calculated by the Elevator Aileron Computers (ELACs))
which is added symmetrically to a possible aileron deflection. The LAF
is inhibited when: - Slats or flaps are extended, or - Speed is less
than 210 kts, or - In direct law, or - Gradually when the speedbrakes
are extended.

ROLL CONTROL NORMAL D/O (3) SIDESTICK
SPOILERS
The sidestick sends electrical orders to the ELevator Aileron Computers
(ELACs) and Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs).
Each spoiler is powered by one hydraulic actuator. Surfaces are
automatically retracted if a fault is detected by the monitoring system
or if there is no electrical supply. In case of loss of hydraulic power
supply: - if retracted, the surface remains retracted, - if not
retracted, the surface will maintain existing deflection to the zero
hinge moment position or less if pushed down by aerodynamics.
ELAC There are two ELACs: ELAC 1 normally controls the ailerons, with
ELAC 2 as back-up. In case of failure of ELAC 1, ELAC 2 will
automatically take control.
NOTE: Spoilers 1 are not used for roll control.
SEC Using orders coming from the ELACs, each SEC sends orders to one or
two pairs of spoilers, without back-up.
FAC Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) 1, with FAC 2 as back-up,
transmits turn coordination orders for the rudder.
FMGC When the autopilot is engaged, the Flight Management and Guidance
Computer (FMGC) sends roll commands to the ELACs and the FACs, and to
the SECs through the ELACs via ARINC 429 data buses.
AILERONS There are two electrically-controlled hydraulic actuators per
aileron, one in active mode and the other in damping mode. The left blue
and right green actuators are controlled by ELAC 1 and the other two
actuators by ELAC 2. All aileron actuators revert to damping mode in
case of a double ELAC failure or green and blue hydraulic low pressure.

YAW CONTROL NORMAL D/O (3) Concentrator (SDAC) through a position XDCR
unit. This position is shown on the lower display unit of the ECAM.
GENERAL The yaw control is done by the rudder, with a maximum deflection
of 25° for the A320 and A321, and 30° for the A318 and A319. The rudder
is operated by three moving body servocontrols with a common mechanical
input.
RUDDER PEDALS The two pairs of rudder pedals are connected together.
They are linked by a cable loop to the mechanical summing point which in
turn is connected to the hydraulic rudder actuators via a differential
unit. Mechanical rudder control is always available from the rudder
pedals. The pedal position signals are sent to the ELevator Aileron
Computers (ELACs) by the transducer (XDCR) unit. If installed, the Force
Transducer Unit (FTU) is used to measure pilots forces applied on the
pedals. This information is not used in flight control system but
transmitted to the Flight Control Data Concentrator (FCDC) to be
recorded by the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR).
ELAC In flight, the ELACs transmit the yaw damping and turn coordination
to the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) for rudder deflection. There
is no feedback to the pedals for yaw damping and turn coordination.
FAC The two FACs control the yaw damper servo controls. FAC 1 has
priority. FAC 2 is in hot stand-by.
RUDDER The rudder is powered by three hydraulic actuators operating in
parallel. The position of the rudder is transmitted to the System Data
Acquisition

CONTROLS The rudder trim actuator is an electromechanical unit, which
converts the electrical input from the Flight Augmentation Computers
(FACs) into a rotation of its output shaft. The rudder trim actuator can
be controlled either by the RUDder TRIM control switch located in the
center pedestal of the cockpit, in manual mode, or by the Flight
Management &amp; Guidance Computers (FMGCs) in AP mode. In both cases orders
are sent via the FACs. In automatic control, the rudder trim function
controlled by the FAC, fulfills the generation and the accomplishment of
the engine failure recovery function. In this case, the engine failure
compensation slow law orders are sent to the rudder trim actuator. The
AP also provides signals, which validate the detection of engine failure
as a function of the engine rating.
DESCRIPTION/OPERATION The rudder trim actuator has two DC motors,
installed on the same shaft. Each one is controlled by one independent
electronic module, with only one motor operating at a time, via FAC1 or
2. The motors permanently coupled to a reduction gear, drive the output
shaft, via a torque limiter. Then the output shaft drives four Rotary
Variable Differential Transducers (RVDTs), transmitting the output shaft
position signal to the FACs.

RUDDER LIMITER OPERATION (3) TRAVEL LIMITATION UNIT The mechanical
design of the Travel Limitation Unit (TLU) is such that a single
mechanical failure (rupture or disconnection) cannot cause the loss of
the travel limitation function. The TLU has two brushless electric
motors separately controlled by an electronic assembly. Each motor
drives two screws via a reduction gear and permits the symmetrical
linear displacement of two nuts used as adjustable stops. A non-locking
rotary stop limits the stroke of one of the screw/nut assemblies which
are irreversible. There are two levers on each connection shaft; one is
connected to the input rod and the other is used as a punctual stop. The
movement of each screw is transmitted to a Rotary Variable Differential
Transducer via the reduction gear which permits to indicate the position
of the variable stop. NOTE: Note: To prevent icing, there is a heating
system which includes two coils and their regulating thermostats.

RUDDER LIMITER OPERATION (3) FAC If both FACs fail, the rudder travel
limitation value is frozen immediately. In this case, an emergency
control brings back the stops to the low speed configuration (maximum
possible deflection of the rudder) when slats are extended. NOTE: Note:
To bring back the stops to the low speed configuration, the motors are
used as 2-phase asynchronous motor energized by 26V 400 Hz power. This
control mode is achieved when the coil of a specific relay ( each motor
has a relay ) is energized for a period of 30 s approximately. This time
is sufficient to bring back the stops to the low speed configuration.

SPEED BRAKE &amp; GROUND SPOILER D/O (3) SPEED BRAKE FUNCTION The speed
brake function is controlled by the pilot from the speed brake lever.
The speed brakes are operated by Spoiler and Elevator Computers (SECs) 1
and 3, and supplied from the hydraulic system. The surfaces used for
this function are spoilers 2 thru 4. When one surface is not available
on one wing, the symmetrical one, on the other wing, is inhibited. The
switching to alternate or direct laws does not have an effect on the
speed brake function. The different priorities of this function are: -
The roll order has priority over the speed brake function. When the sum
of roll and speed brake commands, relative to one surface, is greater
than the maximum possible deflection, the symmetrical surface is
retracted until the difference between the two surfaces is equal to the
roll order. - If the Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) protection is activated with
speed brakes extended, the speed brakes are automatically retracted.
NOTE: To do the test of the spoiler 1 on the ground, a 6° extension of
the spoiler 1 is possible with the speedbrake control lever.

SPEED BRAKE &amp; GROUND SPOILER D/O (3) GROUND SPOILER FUNCTION The ground
spoiler function, calculated in the SECs, is done by all the spoilers 1
thru 5. When the logic conditions which cause the lift dumper extension
are fulfilled, 50 deg deflection orders are sent to the spoilers. The
partial lift dumping function is activated when one Main Landing Gear
(MLG) is not compressed. Spoilers 1 thru 5 are partially deflected (10
deg) to decrease the lift, help the compression of the second MLG strut,
and thus get full ground spoiler extension.

PITCH CONTROL NORMAL D/O (3) SIDE STICK
TRIM WHEELS
The side stick sends electrical orders to the ELevator Aileron Computers
(ELACs) and Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs).
The mechanical trim, which has priority over the electrical trim, is
operated from the manual trim wheels.
ELAC There are two ELACs. ELAC 2 normally controls the elevators and
Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) with ELAC 1 as a backup. In case
of ELAC 2 failure, ELAC 1 automatically takes over.
SEC In case of dual ELACs failure, SEC 1 or 2 automatically takes over
pitch control.
FMGC When the Autopilot (AP) is engaged, the Flight Management and
Guidance Computer (FMGC) sends AP commands to the ELACs.
ELEVATORS Each elevator is powered by two actuators, one in active mode,
and the other in damping mode with automatic changeover in case of
failure. Both actuators become active in case of large pitch demands.
ELAC 2 controls the green and yellow actuators and ELAC 1 controls the
blue actuators.
THS The THS is positioned by a screw actuator driven by two hydraulic
motors, which are controlled by one of the three electric motors. One
electrical trim motor is operative at a time, and the other two are in
standby. Motor 1 is controlled by ELAC 2, motor 2 by ELAC 1 or SEC 1,
and motor 3 by SEC 2.

PITCH CONTROL ABNORMAL D/O (3) ALTERNATE LAW If the normal law of the
ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) 2 fails, the control goes to the
ELAC 1. If the normal law of both ELACs fails, the alternate law takes
over. The failures lead to an activation of the alternate law with
reduced protections.
IN ELAC WITH PROTECTIONS Alternate law with reduced protections
including load factor and stability augmentation, is active in ELAC 1 or
2 in case of either: - double self-detected Air Data Reference (ADR) or
Inertial Reference (IR) failure, - 2nd not self-detected ADR failure, -
double hydraulic failure blue and green or yellow and green, - loss of
roll normal law, - alternate law active in ELAC 1 with emergency
electrical supply.
IN ELAC WITHOUT PROTECTIONS Depending on the failures, the pitch channel
can switch to an alternate law without protections. Alternate law
without protection including stability augmentation lost and load factor
protection retained, is active in ELAC 1 or 2 in case of either: - 2nd
not self-detected ADR failure, - triple ADR failure.

ELAC2 (in normal control) sends a drive command to the servomotor
No1.The electrical motor No1 causes the input levers and control valves
to move and at the same time a mechanical feedback signal is sent from
the override mechanism to the cockpit causing the trim wheels to move.
The hydraulic fluid is supplied to both hydraulic motors through the

and move the ball screw through the power differential. The rotation of
the screw jack gives a feedback signal to the feedback differential,
causing the control valves moving back to neutral, consequently the

normal mode and interactive mode. Normal mode: - the FCDCs send the
flight control system failures to the CFDS, - the CFDS adds general data
such as time, date, ATA chapter, flight phase, leg, to the failure
message on the MCDU display. Interactive mode: the CFDS sends to the
FCDCs: - the request for consultation of the BITE inside each
computer, - the maintenance test request. The CFDS receives faulty Line

PCU/SFCC DESCRIPTION This presentation shows the detailed operation of
the Power Control Unit (PCU) and the Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC),
through a normal extension sequence. As slat and flap system control is
identical, only the flap system is shown. Each SFCC flap channel
includes 2 lanes and an output module that controls its related valve
block. Each valve block includes three solenoid valves. Two of them,
called directional valves, command the control valve spool for
retraction or extension, while the enable solenoid valve controls the
Pressure-Off Brake (POB). The output module has several functions : -
collect and analyze the data from lanes 1 and 2, - output data to the
related valve blocks.

SLATS/FLAPS CONTROL D/O (3) SOLENOID VALVE EXTENSION SELECTION Moving
the slat flap lever rotates the Command Sensor Unit (CSU), which issues
a new position demand signal to each SFCC. This signal is processed in
flap lanes 1 and 2. The position demand and the actual position from the
Feedback Position Pick-off Unit (FPPU) are compared in the SFCC flap
lanes. If the requested and actual positions are different, each lane
generates command signals that are compared by the output module. If the
command signals are in agreement, the output module generates drive
commands for PCU valve block activation. Each SFCC channel controls its
related solenoid valves. As the extend solenoid is energized, the
control valve spool moves from neutral towards the fully deflected
position. The direction of valve spool movement controls the direction
of rotation of the motor. The degree of valve spool movement controls
the rotation speed of the motor. The position of the control valve spool
is monitored by a Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT) mounted
on one end of the valve block.

SLATS/FLAPS ABNORMAL LOCKING OPERATION (3) GENERAL Here is a brief
reminder of the Wing Tip Brake (WTB) application logic. Asymmetry,
runaway, overspeed and uncommanded movement are detected by cross
comparison of Asymmetry Position Pick-Off Unit (APPU) and Feedback
Position Pick-off Unit (FPPU) signals. If any of these failures are
detected by a Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC) and confirmed by the
second one, the WTBs are applied. NOTE: Note that if an SFCC does not
operate, the other SFCC receives a WTB-arm signal automatically. Thus,
if the second SFCC subsequently detects a failure, a solenoid valve on
each WTB is energized.

SLATS/FLAPS ABNORMAL LOCKING OPERATION (3) ASYMMETRY Asymmetry is
defined as a positional difference between the LH and RH APPUs.
Asymmetry is usually due to a broken shaft between both APPUs. The
asymmetry threshold is above 5° synchro positional difference between
both APPUs.
RUNAWAY The SFCCs identify a runaway by comparing the LH and RH APPU
positions with the FPPU position. The reason for a runaway on slat
transmission could be a broken shaft between the slat PCU and the
T-gearbox. To avoid that air loads move the slats in a runaway
condition, the WTBs will be applied. As LH and RH flap transmissions are
directly connected to the Flap PCU only a gearbox failure can cause a
runaway. To avoid that air loads move the flaps in a runaway condition,
the WTBs will be applied.
OVERSPEED An overspeed is detected when the rotation speed of the
transmission measured by any Position Pickoff Unit (PPU) is too high.

SLATS/FLAPS ABNORMAL LOCKING OPERATION (3) FAILURE MONITORING If PCUs
are in operation, extended solenoid and enable solenoid are energized
and the flaps extend. PPU information is used for system monitoring. If
one SFCC detects an asymmetry, its associated valve block is
de-energized. A "WTB arm" signal is sent to the other SFCC flap channel
to check whether asymmetry is confirmed, or not. If the other SFCC
confirms the asymmetry, the WTB solenoid is energized, PCUs are
de-energized and the flap drive system is stopped. A reset of the WTBs
can be done on ground only via the Centralized Fault Display System
(CFDS). If asymmetry is only detected by one computer, the associated
flap drive system is considered faulty.

examples on abnormal operations which cause the system to operate at
half speed. As slat and flap operations are identical, only flaps
operation will be shown. When half speed is detected, a level 1 caution
is generated and a fault message is displayed on the EWD. The STS page
appears after the pilot confirms the Flap fault by pressing the CLEAR
button on the ECAM control panel or calls the STS by pressing STS button
on the ECP. A green message SLAT/FLAP SLOW is displayed on the SD. NOTE:
the STS message " SLAT/FLAP SLOW" will only appear if both Engines are
running. On ground with engines off ,no Slat / Flaps STS message will

SLATS/FLAPS ABNORMAL HALF SPEED OPERATION (3) SFCC FAILURE In this
example Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC) 2 flap channel is inoperative
and SFCC 1 operates normally. Each flap channel lane of SFCC 1 generates
command signals. The drive commands, generated in SFCC1 Output module,
control the related solenoid valve in the flap PCU. Only the related
green hydraulic motor is operative. As the yellow valve block is not
energized, the Pressure-Off Brake (POB) holds the output shaft of the
yellow hydraulic motor. Due to the differential gearbox, the system
moves with full torque at half speed.

motor. Signals from the Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT)
are used to compare the position of the control valve with the drive
command orders. In this example, a green hydraulic low pressure is
detected by SFCC1. As soon as the hydraulic pressure drop is detected,
the PCU valve block solenoids are de-energized. The POB holds the output
shaft of the green hydraulic motor. Only the yellow valve block is
energized, so only the yellow hydraulic motor is operative. Due to the
differential gearbox, the system moves with full torque at half speed.
As the green hydraulic system also supplies one slat PCU motor, the slat
system is affected as well.

SLATS MECHANICAL DRIVE D/O (3) GENERAL Torque shafts and gearboxes
transmit power from the Power Control Unit (PCU) to the actuators which
drive the slat operating mechanism.
PCU The PCU incorporates two hydraulic motors, each controlled by an
electrically signaled valve block. The slat PCU drives the slat
transmission system via a single output shaft.
TORQUE SHAFTS The rotation of the torque shafts drives all gearboxes and
rotary actuator input shafts simultaneously and at the same speed.
Steady bearings, attached to the structure, support the torque shafts
where small angular changes of alignment occur.
GEARBOXES Six gearboxes are used in the slat transmission system where
changes in torque shaft alignment occur: - one 19-degree bevel gearbox
changes alignment under the wing center box, - one T-gearbox changes
alignment through 90 degrees in each wing, - two 63.5-degree bevel
gearboxes take drive from below each wing level into the wing leading
edge.
ACTUATORS The actuators produce the torque and speed reduction necessary
to drive the slats at the required rate. Each actuator drives its
associated slat track through a pinion driven by the actuator output
shaft.

SLATS MECHANICAL DRIVE D/O (3) TRACKS The slats are attached to the
forward ends of the tracks which run in guide rollers. Slat 1 is
supported by four tracks, but only T2 and T3 are driven. T1 and T4
prevent slat loss in case of attachment failure. Slats outboard of the
pylon are supported by two driven tracks.
TORQUE LIMITERS Each actuator incorporates a bi-directional torque
limiter which protects the structure from overload.
WTB The Wing Tip Brakes (WTBs) stop and hold the transmission if the
Slat Flap Control Computers (SFCCs) detect abnormal operation such as
asymmetry and runaway. Once applied, the WTBs can only be reset on the
ground by maintenance action via the Centralized Fault Display System
(CFDS).
APPU The Asymmetry Position Pick Off Units (APPUs) enable the SFCC to
monitor the system for asymmetry and runaway conditions. One APPU is
mounted outboard of track 12 in each wing. It gives the slat actual
position to the SFCC.

attached to the flap bottom surface immediately outboard of each track
position. The forward end of each link arm is bolted to the drive lever
on its associated actuator. At tracks 2, 3 and 4 a track fairing
operating arm is attached to the flap bottom surface. The operating arm
is connected to a linkage that operates the moveable track fairing
during flap extension and retraction. The link arms transmit the drive
from the rotary actuators directly to the flap surface.

FLAPS DRIVE STATIONS D/O (A321) (3) GENERAL Each flap is supported by
carriages that run on tracks extending from the wing rear spar. Each
carriage has a containment device to hold it on the track if a failure
occurs. The carriages, tracks and beams at tracks 2, 3 and 4 are of
similar construction. Track 1 is attached to the fuselage. A hinge
mechanism connects the leading edge of the tab surface to the primary
surface of the flap.

FLAPS ATTACHMENT FAILURE DET DESCRIPTION (3) SENSORS Two flap disconnect
sensors are fitted on the interconnecting strut between inner and outer
flaps on each wing. The flap disconnect sensors, which are proximity
sensors, detect any flap disconnection.
LGCIU Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) receives
signals from two sensors and transmits this data to its related Slat
Flap Control Computer (SFCC). The LGCIUs are used to process signals
from proximity sensors.
SFCC The SFCCs monitor the flap-attachment failure detection sensors to
find connection failure. If the SFCCs receive a flap disconnect
signal: - the valve block solenoids on the Power Control Unit (PCU) are
de-energized, - the Pressure-Off Brakes (POBs) lock the two hydraulic
motors, - the SFCCs give a class 1 level 2 caution and the ECAM display
unit shows a failure message. System reset is only possible on the
ground. The ECAM display unit shows a failure message if: - the SFCC
gets different data from the two sensors on the same wing or, - one
sensor gives incorrect data.

Introduction of new Flight Control Data Concentrator (FCDC) software In
some cases, Reverser INOP may not be indicated to flight crew prior to
selection. In addition, if an ADR is rejected by the ELAC flight control
computer due to faulty air data parameters, the associated failure
message generated does not easily allow the identification of which air
data parameter (angle of attack or speed) is faulty. Moreover, In case
of side stick potentiometer failure detection identified by ELACs and/or
ELAC X FAULT warning, the associated failure message generated does not
easily allow the identification of the faulty equipment. Post
2022/2023 - A new logic has been introduced in FCDC software to standard
58: This is to add indication of additional cases of reverse system
inoperative and to distinguish between the failed Air data parameter ,
identifying an angle of attack probe failure by generating a specific
maintenance message, and in conjunction with FWC from standard H2F5 and
ELAC from standard L93/L84, the appropriate ECAM alert.

FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM TROUBLE SHOOTING AND MINIMIZE NO FAULT FOUND RATE
(ELAC/SEC) Put the trouble shooting on fault message into focus and not
only on the ECAM warning. Indeed, message gives precise information on
the possible root causes. TSM task related to the fault message has to
be followed. Follow step by step the TSM related to the failure
messages: Taking into account previous action done (i.e. LRU removal),
if issue is still there on A/C, do the following step proposed by the
TSM. Send Trouble Shooting data with removed LRU to ease repair in shop
: Repair shop can do dedicated tests or actions (e.g. relay replacement)
if the PFR, test result and / or trouble shooting data, if available,
are given. Intermittent faults must follow a trouble shooting as per TSM
: Intermittent fault = repetitive fault experienced in flight and not
confirmed on ground. - After three occurrences of the same phenomenon
(even if the ground test is still OK), the other steps of the TSM
procedure must be followed. - While doing the wiring inspection, it is
advised to check the wires to help reproducing the issue on ground. Do
the follow-up of A/C &amp; remove the LRU, to confirm the failure origin and
identify potential rogue units: This lets : - either explain No Fault
Found (NFF), if the issue is still shown on A/C. - or to confirm the
failure origin (Fault Found (FF) in accordance with removal cause).

-   or to identify potential rogue Units, if the issue is no more on A/C
    despite NFF LRU. Removed LRU can be put in quarantine pending the
    end of Trouble Shooting: This applies for intermittent trouble
    shooting issues and:
-   give updated and complete information to the repair shop.
-   avoid installation of a unit with intermittent failure on a new A/C.
-   get easier LRU follow-up. Use Thales Chronic unit policy (send units
    suspected as chronics to Thales) : As per Thales policy, chronic
    unit policy (deep investigations) applies to computers:
-   removed 3 times within 18 months.
-   Whatever the reason of removal.

ELEVATOR SERVOCONTROL SWAPPING TOOL (BUNDLE) When applicable, use the
elevator servocontrol swapping tool (bundle). This tool lets either
confirm a servocontrol failure or direct on other possible causes, which
are wiring or computer issue. It can be used in case of an "ELEVATOR
SERVO FAULT" or "ELAC PITCH FAULT" warning message experienced. In this
procedure, the operator can interchange the wiring between two
servocontrols (the one supposed unserviceable and one known as
serviceable). Let there be "X" as ELAC &amp; SEC computers (E1, S1 or E2,
S2) and related servocontrol. Without the swapping tool (normal wiring),
computers "A" control the elevator Servocontrol "A" and computers "B"
control the elevator Servocontrol "B". When the swapping tool is used,
computers "A" control the elevator Servocontrol "B" and computers "B"
control the elevator Servocontrol "A". Two wiring mode can be used to
connect the servocontrols : - Adjacent servocontrol wiring. - Opposite
servocontrol wiring. NOTE: Note: As solenoid valve short-circuit could
cause damage a serviceable computer, swapping is not applicable for
servocontrol solenoid valves issues: see caution note in TSM tasks.
