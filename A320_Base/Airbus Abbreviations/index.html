Accident Investigation Policy and Occurrences Procedure Guide. ICAO
Annex 13 (Amendment 9) Definition: "An occurrence associated with the
operation of an aircraft, which takes place between the time any person
boards the aircraft with the intention of flight, until such time as all
such persons have disembarked, in which: a) A person is fatally or
seriously injured as a result of a. Being in the aircraft b. Direct
contact with any part of the aircraft, including parts which have become
detached from the aircraft c. Direct exposure to jet blast Except when
the injuries are from natural causes, self-inflicted or inflicted by
other persons, or when the injuries are to stowaways hiding outside the
areas normally available to the passengers and crew, or: b) The aircraft
receives substantial damage or structural failure, which adversely
affects the structural strength, performance or flight characteristics
of the aircraft, and would normally require major repair or replacement
of the affected component (before next flight). Except for engine
failure or damage when the damage is limited to the engine,

its cowling or accessories; or for damage limited to propellers, wing
tips, antenna, tires, brakes, fairing, small dents or puncture holes in
the aircraft skin. or: c) The aircraft is missing or is completely
inaccessible. Note: The above definition of an accident does not cover
all possible events. Airbus Expanded Accident Definition: Airbus has
adopted the ICAO definition, but has expanded it beyond aircraft
boarding and disembarkation to encompass ground accidents resulting in
death or serious injury from aircraft-related causes. In other words,
the Airbus definition covers aircraft-related injury or death of
passengers, flight and cabin crews, and ground, dispatch, airport,
maintenance and cleaning personnel that occur outside of "block times",
as well as during any phase of flight operations."

current ones. The NTO is issued in exceptional circumstances and would
normally have a temporary validity. The statement contains information
technically acceptable to Airbus and specifies any conditions, limits or
limitations identified as necessary. The statement is not approved by
the Airbus prime Airworthiness Authority (DGAC - French Airworthiness

Quality
Quality
The totality of characteristics of an entity that bears on its ability
to satisfy stated and implied needs.
ISO 8402
Notes: 1. In a contractual environment or in a regulated environment,
such as the nuclear safety field needs are specified, whereas in other
environments, implied needs should be identified and defined. 2. In many
instances, needs can change with time; this implies periodic review of
requirements for quality. 3. Needs are usually into characteristics with
specified criteria. Needs may include for example, aspects of
performance, usability, dependability, (availability, reliability,
maintainability), safety, environment, economics and aesthetics. 4. The
term "quality" should not be used as a single term to express a degree
of excellence in a comparative sense nor should it be used in a
quantitative sense for technical evaluations. To express these meanings,
a qualifying adjective should be used. For example, use can be made of
the following terms: a) "relative quality" where entities are ranked on
a relative basis in the "degree of excellence" or "comparative sense"
(not to be confused with grade); b) "quality level" in a "quantitative
sense" (as used in acceptance sampling) and "quality measure" where
precise technical evaluations are carried out. 5. The achievement of
satisfactory quality involves all stages of the quality loop as a whole.
The contributions to quality of these various stages are sometimes
identified separately for emphasis; for example quality due to
definition of needs, quality due to product design, quality due to
conformance, quality due to product support through its lifetime. In
some references, quality is referred to as "fitness for use" or "fitness
for purpose" or "customer satisfaction" or "conformance to the
requirements". These represent only certain facets of quality as defined
above.

Quality Assurance
Quality
All the planned and systematic activities implemented within the quality
system, and demonstrated as needed, to provide adequate confidence that
an entity will fulfill requirements for quality. Notes: 1. These are
both internal and external purposes for quality assurance. a) Internal
quality assurance: within an organization, quality assurance provides
confidence to the management. b) External quality assurance: in
contractual or other situations, quality assurance provides confidence
to the customers or others. 2. Some quality control and quality
assurance actions are interrelated. 3. Unless requirements for quality
fully reflect the needs of the user, quality assurance may not provide
adequate confidence.
ISO 8402
Quality Audit
Quality
Systematic and independent examination to determine whether quality
activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and
whether these arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable
to achieve objectives. Notes: 1. Often called "quality system audit",
"process quality audit", "product quality audit" or "service quality
audit". 2. Quality audits are carried out by staff not having direct
responsibility in the areas being audited but, preferably, working in
cooperation with the relevant personnel. 3. One purpose of a "quality
audit" is to evaluate the need for improvement or corrective action. An
audit should not be confused with quality "surveillance" or "inspection"
activities performed for the purpose of process control or product
acceptance. 4. Quality audits can be conducted for internal or external
purposes.
ISO 8402
Quality Control
Quality
Operational techniques and activities that are used to fulfill
requirements for quality. Notes: 1. Quality control involves operational
techniques and activities aimed both at monitoring a process and at
eliminating causes of unsatisfactory performance at all stages of the

control and quality assurance actions are interrelated.

Codes allocated to a change (MOD/MP) launched in design and production.
These codes make it possible to: - Express the configuration(s) for
which the change has to be developed, - Determine the ranges of MSN's on
which the change shall be embodied before delivery. These codes consist
of the Standard(s), Industrial Standard(s) and/or Versions for which the
change is valid, the corresponding modification category and the
embodiment point (or range). Note: When the change is only applicable to
in-service aircraft, the validity does not indicate the embodiment
points.

Visual Flight Rules
Aircraft Operation/Flight Operations
VFRs are rules governing aircraft operation during visual weather
conditions, that is with a specified minimum visibility and minimum
distance away from cloud, and governing the flight plan of an aircraft
operating under these conditions. Flight above a cloud layer is
permitted if the way to the destination airport is clear of cloud. The
pilot need not have an instrument rating but the aircraft must have a
specified minimum of equipment, including a radio if the flight plan
crosses controlled zones.

Work Breakdown Structure
Aircraft Project Management
Redundant term used in the past to refer to an aircraft which had been
completed but not allocated (no logo on the vertical stabilizer). The
WBS is a deliverable-oriented, organized grouping of project elements
which organizes and defines the total scope of a project. Each
descending level element represents an increasingly detailed definition
of project components; which may be either products or services.
