on the engine inlet which could affect the engine operation. The engine
air intake is heated during icing conditions using its related bleed
air. The hot air is then discharged overboard.
**SOURCE**
Hot air for the Nacelle anti-ice system is supplied by a dedicated HP
Compressor (HPC) bleed:
\- on the CFM-LEAP, 7th stage,
\- on the PW1000G, 6th stage.
**VALVE**
The NAI System is controlled and monitored by the Propulsion Control
System (PCS) (EEC and EIU). Each engine NAI System consists of two
electrically controlled, pneumatically operated Pressure Regulating and
Shut-Off Valves (PRSOV).
The EEC energizes the solenoid to CLOSE the PRSOV. Therefore, in case of
loss of electrical power supply, the valves will go fully open provided
the engine bleed air supply pressure is high enough. In the absence of
air pressure, the valve is spring-loaded to the closed position.
**CONTROLS**
When the ENG ANTI ICE P/BSW is selected ON, signals are sent to EEC for
controlling the valves and to the EIU to calculate the bleed decrements.
**ECAM PAGE**
If at least one of the two engine air intake anti-ice protection systems
is selected ON, a message appears in green on the upper ECAM right

PROTECTION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION
**NAI SYSTEM**
Each engine air intake has its own independent Nacelle Anti-Ice (NAI)
protection system and control.
NAI System uses the hot bleed air from the 7th stage High Pressure
Compressor (HPC).
The air is sent through ducts, 2 Pressure Regulated Shut-Off Valves
(PRSOVs) located in Core Zone and is then discharged into the air intake
lip.
The EEC monitors the system operability with two Pressure Transducers
(PTs) and Fan temperature sensor.
**AIR INLET**
The airflow exits the D-duct by a single exhaust grid at the bottom of
the nacelle outside the fan. Ducts are insulated in the fan compartment,
in order to keep duct surface temperature below 200Â°C, to protect from
duct burst and to minimize the risk of flammable fluids ignition.

PROTECTION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION
**PRSOV CONTROL AND OPERATION**
The NAI system is controlled and monitored by the Propulsion Control
System (PCS): Electronic Engine Control (EEC) and Engine Interface Unit
(EIU).The EECs control the PRSOV\'s operation by
energizing/de-energizing the solenoids.
PRSOV 1 is controlled by EEC A and PRSOV 2 is controlled by EEC
B. Each PRSOV pneumatically regulates the downstream air pressure.
When the NAI PB S/W is selected to \'ON\' position, the EECs de-energize
the 2 solenoids and the PRSOVs go to a regulating or open position.
The PRSOV 1 regulates the upstream pressure at 88 psig then in cascade
PRSOV 2 the downstream pressure at 68 psig.
**MONITORING**
The EECs do a detailed monitoring of the PRSOVs with two PTs (PT
1 & PT 2) located downstream each PRSOV.
PT1 is located in between the PRSOVs in the AFT side of the fan case. It
gives the feedback to channel B only and use for trouble shooting.
PT2 is located downstream of PRSOV 2 near where the air is delivered. It
gives the feedback to both the EEC channels for monitoring function in
case of single failure of EEC channel.
Two temperature sensors located in the fan case bottom and top, provide
the 2 EEC (channels) with the fan compartment temperature measurement
for NAI leakage detection.
When the engine is running and a \"Hot Air Leakage\" event is detected,
the EEC energizes PRSOVs solenoids, which provide insulation function.

PROTECTION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION
They remain latched until the engine is shutdown (N2\<20% and Master
**ENGINE ANTI ICE P/BSW**
Lever in Off position) and the A/C is on the ground.
The P/B SW sends a discrete signal to the 2 EEC channels to operate the
PRSOVs. The 2 EECs check valid signal through the Cross Channel Data
Link (CCDL).
The P/B SW position and the opposite engine P/B SW position are
monitored by the EIU for computing the bleed decrements.
The \"FAULT\" light is triggered by the EIU based on the input from EEC.
It appears when the engine is running and NAI is failed in OPEN or
CLOSED. It also appears in case of monitoring fault.
**PCS (EEC and EIU)**
The EEC controls the PRSOV to open when the P/B SW is set to ON.
The EEC monitors the position of the PRSOV by the two NAI transducers to
trigger associated fault messages.
Failure messages are computed by the EEC and sent by the EIU to the FWS
and CFDIU.
**FAILURE CONDITION**
The fail safe position of the valves in case of EEC dual channel failure
is OPEN.
In case of a single valve failure, the corresponding valve being failed
open, the anti-ice function is still available.
Per Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) a PRSOV can be manually locked
open or closed.
The two pressure Transducers (PT1 for core zone and PT2 for fan zone)
monitors leak or burst scenarios and a dual fan case thermocouple helps
in identifying over temperature conditions due to leaks or burst. The
EEC monitors the same and generates warning messages to the FWS.
The Upstream and Downstream PRSOVs are commanded and latched to OFF if a
burst duct is detected ignoring the NAI Command Selection.

The PRSOVs operation and functionality depend on the valve inlet
pressure.
In normal mode, when the NAI P/B is selected the PRSOVs regulate, the

Here are the cockpit effects of the possible failures.

LAVatory(ies) (LAV(s)) and galley which use the failed drain mast must
be shut off. As a result, the LAV(s) will not be usable and must be
secured closed and locked.

SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE
**MAINTENANCE TIPS**
When the aircraft is parked, it is recommended to install protective
covers on the air data probes (static ports, pitot probes, AOA probes,
TAT
probes). The protective covers help protect the probes from
contamination.
The covers should be marked with REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT. Ground personnel
must insure that the covers are removed before flight or before power is
applied to the probes (engine start or ground test).
The probe heat system operates automatically to power the air data probe
heaters when at least one engine is running. It is also designed to
operate automatically when the aircraft is in flight. During the
troubleshooting and the on ground operations, observe the following
precautions:
\- if the Probe Heat Computer (PHC) power supply C/B is pulled, the PHC
internal relay will relax and the related probes will be heated. Make
sure to pull ALL of the associated probe heat C/B\'s (Static supply
(28VDC), AOA supply, Pitot supply & TAT supply (all 115 VAC)).
\- if the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply C/B is pulled, the
PHC
will sense an \"engine running\" condition and the probes will be
heated.
Make sure to pull ALL of the probe heat C/B\'s (Static supply (28VDC),
AOA supply, Pitot supply & TAT supply (all 115 VAC)).
\- if the C/B of the LGCIU is pulled, it simulates FLIGHT situation. So
the probe heating is also switched ON.
