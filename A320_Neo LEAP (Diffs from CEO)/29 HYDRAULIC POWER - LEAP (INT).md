\- brakes,
\- nose wheel steering,
\- cargo doors,
\- thrust reverser operation,
\- Constant Speed Motor / Generator (CSM/G).
Hydraulic fluid cannot be transferred from one system to another.
A reservoir in each hydraulic system is pressurized with air to prevent
cavitation.
The green and yellow hydraulic systems are each pressurized by an Engine
Driven Pump (EDP) 1 and 2.
The yellow hydraulic system can also be pressurized by an electric pump.
It is mainly used on ground for maintenance and cargo door operation.
If no electric power is available, a hand pump in the yellow system can
be used to operate the cargo doors.
A Power Transfer Unit (PTU) enables the green system to be pressurized
by the yellow system and vice versa. It transfers the hydraulic power
but does not transfer the hydraulic fluid.
Fire shut-off valves shut off Hydraulic fluid supply to the EDPs in case
of fire.
They isolate the systems in case of an engine fire.
The blue hydraulic system is pressurized by an electric pump.
The electric pump is the main pump for the blue system.

PRESENTATION (1) **SAFETY PRECAUTIONS**
When you work on the aircraft, make sure that you obey all the AMM
safety procedures. This will prevent injury to persons and/or damage to
the aircraft. Here is an overview of main safety precautions relative to
the Hydraulic Power System.
Make sure that the hydraulic system you work on is isolated before you
pressurize the other hydraulic systems.
Make sure that the travel ranges of the flight controls are clear.
Movement of the flight controls can cause injury to persons and/or
damage to the aircraft.
Do not get hydraulic fluid or hot gas from hydraulic reservoir on your
body. Use protective clothing to prevent risk of poisoning and burns.
Use solvents, cleaning agents, sealants and other special materials in a
ventilated area. To prevent inadvertent breathing or contact with your
body, use applicable gloves, eye protections and face mask.
Install safety devices and warning before working on or near landing
gear and related doors.
