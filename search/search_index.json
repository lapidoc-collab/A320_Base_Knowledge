A decision was made on the system indicator lights on the overhead panel that indicator lights do not come on when systems are in normal operation and there are no failures. This ergonomic design enabled the pilots to immediately see when a system is faulty or has been manually shut off. Most of the pushbuttons with light have two stable positions: pressed in and released out, each position is related to a control signal sent to a system. Pressed in (recessed): - normally used system activation (AUTO or ON), - temporarily used system activation (ON), - system activated for maintenance operation (ON) or override (OVRD). Released out (flush with the panel) - deactivation of a system (OFF), - manual activation of a system (ON), - activation of an alternate system (ALTN). Some pushbuttons have only one stable position: - released out. When pushed, they send a control signal to the system.

Airbus divides GSE into two categories: - tools, - standard GSE. Tools can be split into two categories: - standard tools, - specific tools STANDARD TOOLS Standard tools are hand tools such as spanners, sockets, gauges, torque wrenches... The specifications (size, range, capacity, accuracy...) are given in the related Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) task to let operators use the tool brand of their choice. Standard tools for Aircraft Maintenance are all in US units. Metric tools maybe required for shop maintenance. They are not required for aircraft maintenance but will be required to maintain Airbus specific tools and, in some cases, for aircraf component maintenance in the shop.

All maintenance tools for \"on - aircraft\" maintenance such as the AMM, Trouble Shooting Manual (TSM)... and for \"off - aircraft\" maintenance such as the Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) are found in the Support Equipment Summary (SES) document. The SES covers all Airbus aircraft types and all associated documentation. If a tool does not appear in the SES it is not a tool for Airbus aircraft or equipment. All specific tools called up for \"on - aircraft\" maintenance in the AMM and the TSM are illustrated in the Tool Equipment Manual (TEM).

MPD reflects all repetitive scheduled maintenance tasks declared by AD/CN, AOT, ISB, SIL, and MOD/SB and analyzed under the MRB. A typical scheduled repetitive task (Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) scavenge filter) is listed with the following data: - the threshold interval, source document, cross-references to other manuals or documents (Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) and SIL), - Man Hours required to accomplish the work, - the applicability in this Envelope document. Note the Zonal inspection, requested by C CHECK interval, on the tension of the fan cowl latches, the AOT, AMM and SIL cross-referenced. Some maintenance tasks have a higher ranking of requirement, when the maintenance requirement is identified as: - \"Airworthiness Limitations Item\" (ALI) or \"Life limit parts\", - \"Certification Maintenance Requirements\" (CMR). The approved document MRB REPORT Appendix 1 lists all these airworthiness approved issues, the ALIs and CMRs. The MPD details these airworthiness related items in the \"Time controlled Items\" and \"Life Limits\" sections. It is the responsibility of each operator to adjust his own maintenance program in accordance with his National Authority.

The forward point \"A\" is located forward of the nose landing gear. The points \"B\" are located outboard of the engine pylons. A safety stay must be positioned at the rear of the aircraft after jacking to stabilize the aircraft. You can lift the aircraft at the forward jacking point only, with the wheels of the main landing gear on the ground. When the aircraft is weighed on landing gear jacks the following jacking points must be used to lift it. - 2 jacking points located in the main landing gear, - 1 jacking point located in the nose landing gear. LIMITATIONS The open air jacking operation is limited if the wind velocity exceeds permissible values which depend on aircraft gross weight and center of gravity position. In any condition, the aircraft must be pointing upwind. The LH, RH and nose jack pad adapters are different and must not be interchanged. Those for the A321 are also different from those of the other aircraft and must not be interchanged. SHORING Shoring is necessary to give support to the wing in order to release the loads on the structure when you do major work or modifications. The AMM shoring procedure gives the general principle only. Use the detailed shoring instructions given in: - SRM 51-51-50, when shoring is required for specific Airbus repairs. - ARM 3-28, when shoring is required for recovery of the aircraft. SHORING OF THE AIRCRAFT PRECAUTIONS Before you lift the aircraft, you must be sure that the ground safety-locks are in position on the landing gears and the weight of fuel is applied equally on the two sides of the aircraft centerline. The three jacks must be operated together. When the jacking operation is completed, install the safety stay to make the aircraft stable. Do not use the safety stay to lift the aircraft. The safety stay must be removed for the gear swing. First you must lift the aircraft, refer to the AMM 07-11-00. Put SHORES in position below the wing front spar and rear spar. For detailed instructions refer to the SRM 51-51-00. Make sure that the wing touches the shores. JACKING POINTS Put jacking pads below the jacking points to apply the loads equally. NOTE: It is necessary to use the jack pad adapters when the aircraft is put on jacks.

Load cells on each jack or platform scales are used for weighing. QUICK LEVELING PROCEDURE WITH THE ADIRU First, follow the Inertial Reference (IR) alignment procedure. Then on the MCDU scratchpad the alpha call-up code has to be entered: - PTCH for the pitch angle to do a check of the longitudinal alignment, - ROLL for the roll angle to do a check of the transverse alignment. To start this procedure, first of all the aircraft must be lifted. After that, read the pitch and roll angles in the MCDU scratchpad. Then operate the hydraulic jack below the wing to get the transverse alignment. Then operate the forward hydraulic jack to get the longitudinal alignment. When you have done the longitudinal alignment, do a check of the transverse alignment.

For this method two persons are necessary: - one in the cargo compartment to move the spirit level, - another one near the aircraft to operate the jacks. While the aircraft is being lifted, put a spirit level on a track: - in the Y axis, perpendicular to the tracks, and operate the hydraulic jack below the wing to get the transverse alignment, - in the X axis, and operate the forward hydraulic jack to get the longitudinal alignment. When you have done the longitudinal alignment, do a check of the transverse alignment.

The A/C may be towed or pushed back: - at maximum ramp weight, - with the engines shut down or running at idle. To begin the procedure, make sure: - that the safety devices are installed on the landing gears (L/G), - the wheel chocks are in place, - and check if the parking brake is ON. Do not tow the A/C if the dimension H is more than 300 mm (11.8 in). If you do, you can cause damage to the internal centering cams of the nose landing gear (NLG). Referring to your A/C maintenance manual, make sure that the A/C is stable. Let us suppose that this procedure has been correctly done. During this procedure, depending on the configuration you are in, the A/C needs to be energized either by using the APU, a specific ground cart, an engine running, or by using the tractor itself. Let us suppose that the A/C is already energized and the EIS start procedure done. Outside, on the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, set the ground-towing control lever to the towing position and install the pin. In the cockpit, - on the upper ECAM page, the \"Nose.WHEEL STEERinG DISConnected\" message comes into view on the memo page. - check on the Yellow brake-pressure triple-indicator that the accumulator pressure pointer is in the green range. We recommend pressurizing the yellow hydraulic system using the yellow electrical pump, thus, the braking system will be more efficient and safer. Now, we have to install the tow bar. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD CAUTION: Caution: make sure that the tow bar has: - a damping system - a calibrated shear pin - two calibrated turn shear pins. This is to prevent high loads causing damage to the L/G. Refer to your A/C maintenance manual for the calibration of these pins. On the NLG, install the tow bar on the tow fitting and connect the tow bar to the tractor. CAUTION: Caution: put the parking brake control switch in the off position before you tow or push back the A/C. This is to prevent high loads causing damage to the NLG. On the Yellow brake-pressure triple-indicator, the brakes pressure pointers go down. In the cockpit, set the lighting system: - set the exterior light navigation and logo switch to ON. - at night, set the interior light dome switch to bright and if the anti-collision lighting is necessary for the local airport regulations or the airline procedures, set the exterior light beacon switch to ON. On the VHF system: - in order to communicate with the control tower during towing operations, release out the VHF pushbutton switch and select the control tower frequency on the radio management panel. - in order to communicate with the ground mechanics, on the audio control panel, set the interphone radio switch to the interphone position and release out the interphone reception pushbutton. For safety reasons, a distance of 3 meters (10 ft) must be kept clear around the nose wheels, tow bar and tractor when the aircraft moves. Towing speed limitation depends on the position of the passenger/crew and cargo doors. For these speed limitations refer to your A/C maintenance manual.

When you use the front fittings to push the A/C rearwards with engine at idle this angle is limited to 40 degrees. At this point, be sure that all warnings and cautions of your A/C maintenance manual procedure and previous precautions are applied. Now, the A/C can be towed slowly and smoothly. Two other persons have to monitor the wing tips during the towing operation and one person is required in the cockpit in order to operate the brakes. When you complete the towing operation, make sure that the nose wheels are aligned with the A/C centerline. Inform the cockpit to apply the parking brake, and check that the parking brake light is ON on the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box. Put the wheel chocks in position. Disconnect the tow bar from the nose gear fittings. On the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, remove the safety pin and set the ground-towing control lever to the normal position. At the same time, in the cockpit, on the ECAM memo display the message \"N.WHEEL STEERG DISC\" disappears. On the lighting system: - reset the exterior light beacon and navigation & logo switches to OFF. - reset the interior light dome switch to OFF. On the communication system: - cut the cockpit/control tower VHF link by pressing in the VHF pushbutton on the radio management panel. - reset the interphone radio switch to the neutral position. Depressurize the yellow hydraulic system, do the EIS stop procedure and de-energize the A/C electrical circuits.

In details, this system provides the following functions: - cabin temperature control, - pressurization control, - avionics ventilation, - cargo compartment ventilation & heating (optional). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 6 of 129 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY SYSTEM OVERVIEW Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 7 of 129 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) For the zones in which warmer temperatures are necessary, the ACSC sends a signal to the related TRIM AIR VALVE to open. Hot air mixes with the Mixer Unit discharge air and the temperature increases. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) CABIN TEMPERATURE CONTROL The Single Aisle family has two air conditioning packs installed in the wing root area, forward of the landing gear bay. The packs supply conditioned air to the cabin for air conditioning, ventilation and pressurization. The primary component of each pack assembly is the air cycle machine. Hot air from the pneumatic system is supplied to the pack through the pack Flow Control Valve (FCV). The FCV adjusts the flow rate through the pack and is the pack shut-off valve. During normal operation, the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) calculates the flow mass demand and sets the flow control valve in the necessary reference position. The pack temperature control system controls the pack outlet temperature and sets its maximum and minimum limits. The system includes two ACSCs. Each ACSC controls one pack. To control the pack outlet temperature, the ACSC modulates the BYPASS VALVE and the RAM-AIR INLET doors. The packs supply the mixer unit. Three separate aircraft zones are supplied from the mixer unit: - cockpit, - forward cabin, - aft cabin. Two cabin recirculation fans are installed to reduce the bleed air demand and therefore save fuel. These fans establish a recirculation flow of air from the cabin zones to the mixer unit. In normal operation, there are no ECAM indications associated with the cabin fans. The ACSC controls and monitors the temperature regulation system for the cabin zones. On the overhead AIR COND panel, the flight crew selects the desired individual compartment temperature. The hot air system for cabin temperature control has a trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) and trim air valves controlled by the ACSC.

The pressurized areas are: - the cockpit, - the avionics bay, - the cabin, - the cargo compartments. The concept of the system is simple. Air is supplied from the air conditioning packs to the pressurized areas. An outflow valve is used to adjust the quantity of air that is released from the pressurized cabin. Automatic control of the outflow valve is provided by two Cabin Pressure Controllers (CPCs). Each CPC controls one electric motor on the outflow valve assembly. The CPCs interface with other aircraft computers to optimize the pressurization / depressurization schedule. There are two automatic pressurization systems. Each CPC and its electric motor make up one system. Only one system operates at a time with the other system acting as backup in case of a failure. The system in command will alternate each flight. A third motor is installed for manual operation of the outflow valve in case both automatic systems fail. To protect the fuselage against excessive cabin differential pressure, safety valves are installed on the rear pressure bulkhead. The safety valves also protect against negative differential pressure. The Residual Pressure Control Unit (R PCU) prevents residual pressure in the cabin and takes over the control of the outflow valve automatically. To do this, it supplies power directly to the manual motor of the outflow valve.

This includes the equipment in the avionics compartment, the flight deck instruments and the circuit breaker panels. A blower fan and an extraction fan supply the air through the avionics equipment. NOTE: Note: These fans operate continuously while the aircraft electrical system is supplied. The Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) controls the fans and the configuration of the skin valves in the avionics ventilation system based on flight / ground logic and fuselage skin temperature. There are 3 configurations for the skin air inlet and outlet valves: - open circuit: the two valves are open (on ground only), - closed circuit: the two valves are closed (in flight or if there is low external air temperature on ground). The air temperature is decreased in the skin heater exchanger. The skin heat exchanger is a chamber which lets the air be in contact with the fuselage skin during flight, - intermediate circuit: the inlet is closed and the outlet is open, but not fully.

A heating system can also be installed in these two compartments or only one of them. The heating system will only be installed together with a ventilation system. The operation is equivalent for the two compartments, thus we will only look at the forward cargo compartment as an example. Air from the main cabin is supplied into the cargo compartment by the extract fan or by differential pressure in flight (FWD Cargo Compartment only). After its circulation through the compartment, the air is discharged overboard. The operation of the two isolation valves and the extract fan is controlled automatically by the cargo Ventilation Controller (VC). One VC can control one cargo compartment or the two of them. For the heating of the cargo compartment, the pilots select the desired compartment temp and hot bleed air is mixed with the air coming from the main cabin to increase the temperature if necessary. The supply of hot air is controlled by the Cargo Heating Controller. Each heated compartment has a dedicated Cargo Heating Controller. There is NO direct air conditioning supply to the cargo compartments. The pilots cannot add \"cold\" air to the compartments.

Hot air pressure is maintained above the cabin pressure, which lets the hot airflow join the pack air supply when necessary. Part of the cabin air is recirculated to decrease air supply demand. The conditioned air is distributed to three main zones: - cockpit, - forward cabin, - aft cabin. Normally, the mixer unit lets the cockpit be supplied from pack 1 and FWD and aft cabins from pack 2. PACK UNITS The airflow from the air bleed system is regulated by two pack Flow Control Valves (FCVs). Two independent packs then supply air with a regulated temperature to the mixer unit. Both packs supply air at the same temperature. LAV AND GALY VENTILATION The LAVatory and GALleY ventilation system uses air from the cabin zones. A fan extracts this air through the outflow valve. NOTE: Note: The LAV and GALY ventilation system is also used to ventilate the cabin zone temperature sensors. MIXER UNIT The mixer unit mixes air with a regulated temperature from the packs with part of the cabin air supplied by the recirculation fans. The mixer unit can also receive conditioned air from an LP ground connection or fresh outside air from the emergency ram air inlet. The emergency ram air inlet supplies outside fresh air for ventilation of the A/C in emergency conditions when there is loss of both packs or smoke removal. ACSC The Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) does: - temperature regulation in accordance with demand, - flow control and monitoring in accordance with flow control demand. TRIM AIR PRV Hot air tapped upstream of the packs supplies the trim air valves through a trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV). This valve regulates the downstream pressure 4 psi above the cabin pressure. HOT TRIM AIR A trim air valve associated with each zone optimizes the temperature by adding hot air, if necessary, to the air from the mixer unit.

The flow regulation is done by a torque motor under the control of the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC). If the pack compressor outlet temperature is > 215\u00b0C (419\u00b0F), the FCV starts to reduce the flow. A compressor outlet temperature > 260\u00b0C (500\u00b0F) results in a pack overheat warning. the exchangers. To increase cooling, the ram air inlet flap opens more and the BYP valve closes more. To increase heating, the ram air inlet flap closes more and the BYP valve opens more. During take-off and landing, the ram air inlet flap is closed to prevent ingestion of foreign objects. NOTE: Note: Part of the hot air, downstream of the pack FCV, is sent to the trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV). Each pack FCV is automatically closed during either a same side engine start sequence or an opposite side engine start sequence, if the crossbleed valve is detected open. It reopens 30 seconds after the end of any engine start sequence. EXCHANGERS - COMPRESSOR Bleed air is ducted to the primary heat exchanger, then to the compressor. The air is cooled in the main heat exchanger. It then goes through the reheater, the condenser and the water extractor in order to remove water particles from the air entering the turbine. TURBINE The air expands in the turbine section, which results in a very low turbine discharge air temperature. The turbine drives the compressor and the cooling air fan. RAM AIR INLET FLAP AND BYP VALVE The BYPass valve and the ram air inlet flap are simultaneously controlled by the air conditioning system controller. The BYP valve is operated by an electro-mechanical actuator to modulate the pack discharge temperature by adding hot air.

The FCU operates in MAIN or BACK-UP mode, controlled by the ACSC through the solenoids. The functions of the components are: - Solenoid 1 controls the ON/OFF (isolation) function. When this solenoid is energized, the FCV is open and regulates when bleed air pressure is available. - Solenoid 2 controls the MAIN or BACK-UP operation. When this solenoid is de-energized, the FCV operates in MAIN mode. The solenoid is energized for BACK-UP operation.

The flow regulation is a function of the torque motor controlled by the related ACSC compared with the flow setting on panel 30VU. The ACSC uses the signal from the DIFFERENTIAL PRESS SENSOR to determine the air flow that goes through the pack. ACSC 1 only does the air flow calculation. The signal is then sent to ACSC 2 for the flow control of pack 2. In some special aircraft configurations, the air flow is set to a specified value. These default settings are: HIGH FLOW: - during pack operation with the APU bleed air supply, - during single pack operation. LOW FLOW: - during take-off and landing. The PACK INLET PRESSURE SENSOR is used to calculate the bleed air necessary for the pack operation.

The primary heat exchanger is an air-to-air heat exchanger type and the cooling medium used is external ram air. The compressor increases the air pressure and thus increases the energy of the air. At the same time, the air temperature increases again.

The humidity contained in the air will condensate and make water droplets. This is necessary to extract the humidity from the air. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 50 of 129 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY CONDENSER Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 51 of 129 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY FLOW CONTROL & PACK COMPONENTS D/O (3) WATER EXTRACTOR AND INJECTOR The air from the condenser is sent through the WATER EXTRACTOR. Guide vanes will supply this air at high speed and centrifugal forces will extract the water from the air flow. The extracted water is injected into the ram air duct through the WATER INJECTOR. This increases the cooling efficiency of the primary and main heat exchangers. This is usually done only on ground or in low altitudes. REHEATER The air, which then contains almost no water, goes to the REHEATER. The REHEATER uses warm air from the main heat exchanger outlet to increase again the temperature of the cold air that comes from the water extractor. This is necessary to vaporize the last remaining water droplets before the air is sent to the ACM turbine and to prevent damage to the turbine.

The result is a fast decrease of the air pressure and air temperature to below 0\u00b0C (-50\u00b0C as maximum negative temperature). PACK DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR AND CHECK VALVE The cold air flows through the condenser again. This cold airflow is used to decrease the temperature of the warm air to below the dew point before the air goes into the water extractor. Downstream of the condenser, the ACSC uses the PACK DISCHARGE TEMPerature SENSOR to monitor the pack outlet temperature. The sensor is used for indication on the ECAM COND page. A pack overheat warning will start at a temperature of more than 88\u00b0C. The PACK CHECK VALVE, which is downstream of the condenser, stops leakage of air from the distribution system when the FCV is closed. The check valve is attached to the pressure bulkhead of the forward fuselage.

PACK TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND BYPASS VALVE In relation to the input made by the pilots from panel 30VU and the related temperature selector, the ACSC compares the specified temperature with the sensed pack temperature. To adjust the temperature, the ACSC sends an electrical signal to the stepper motor of the Bypass Valve (BYP VLV). When controlled to a more open position, the valve bypasses hot air from the ACM compressor inlet around the ACM to the turbine outlet and thus increases the outlet temperature of the pack. This temperature control is used for short term and for a fast pack response. RAM AIR ACTUATOR For long term pack temperature control, the ACSC modulates the ram air cooling flow through the heat exchangers. To do this, it controls the position of the RAM AIR ACTUATOR and thus the position of the ram air inlet flap. The position of the ram air inlet flap is monitored by the SPEED AND DIRECTION SENSOR attached to the actuator. In some special aircraft configurations (take-off and landing), the ram air flap is controlled to the fully closed position to prevent dirt ingestion from the nose landing gear. ACM FAN During aircraft operation on ground, the ACM FAN is used to supply cooling air around the primary and the main heat exchangers. In flight with ram air available, the fan will be bypassed to prevent a negative effect on the ACM operation.

If the difference between these two pressure values is more than a specified limit, then there can be icing at the condenser This causes the ACSC to command the bypass valve (BYP VLV) to a more open position and hot air flows directly into the turbine outlet airflow. This hot air will melt the ice at the condenser, which causes the pack discharge pressure to get back to a normal value. When the pressure values are below the activation threshold, the bypass valve goes back to the normal temperature regulating position.

The ACSC will send a signal to the RAM AIR INLET ACTUATOR if the temperature increases to more than 180\u00b0C. This will cause an increase of the cooling airflow around the heat exchangers and an overheat condition will be prevented. If there is no positive effect on the compressor outlet temperature, the ACSC will send a signal to the torque motor of the FCV to control it to a more closed position. This will decrease the hot air supply into the pack. At a temperature of 260\u00b0C and with the aircraft on ground, the ACSC will close the FCV and send a signal to the panel 30VU. This signal causes the FAULT light in the related PACK pushbutton switch to come on. In flight, the FCV remains open. An ECAM warning will start.

It is connected to the corresponding ACSC. PACK INLET PRESSURE SENSOR The pack inlet pressure sensor signals a pack inlet pressure drop to the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC). It is used to determine the appropriate BYPass valve position. When the pack inlet pressure is low, the BYP valve is controlled to a more open position in order to decrease the Differential Pressure (DELTA P) of the air conditioning pack. At the same time, the ram air inlet flap is controlled to a more open position to compensate for the decreased efficiency of the turbine/compressor cycle. Also, when engines are idle, if the cooling demand cannot be satisfied, the engine idle setting can be changed by a thrust demand. WATER EXTRACT TEMPERATURE SENSOR DELTA P SENSOR The pack discharge temperature sensor signals the pack outlet temperature to the ACSC for ECAM display. The pack outlet temperature sensor also gives pack overheat warning indications if the pack outlet temperature exceeds 88\u00b0C (190\u00b0F). A DELTA P sensor measures a differential pressure at the Flow Control Valve (FCV) inlet. This DELTA P, which is equivalent to the airflow, is converted into an electrical signal and sent to the ACSC. It is used for ECAM display and FCV control. The water extract temperature sensor signals the water extractor temperature for the pack outlet temperature control. The pack temperature sensor has two thermistors: one sensing element is connected to lane 1 and the other to lane 2 of the related ACSC. They are used to modulate the pack outlet temperature. PACK DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR The compressor discharge temperature sensor signals the compressor outlet temperature to the ACSC for pack temperature control and overheat detection. Pack temperature control: - up to 180\u00b0C (385\u00b0F): normal operation, - 180\u00b0C to 220\u00b0C (428\u00b0F): the ram air inlet flap opens more in order to increase the RAM airflow. The pack FAULT light comes on in if there is pack overheat of 260\u00b0C (500\u00b0F). If the A/C is on ground, automatic FCV closure occurs.

The mixer unit, installed under the cabin floor, uses cabin air, which has entered the underfloor area and has been drawn through recirculation filters by recirculation fans. This air is mixed with conditioned air from the packs. The quantity of cabin air mixed with conditioned air varies from 37% to 51% (the cabin fans operate at a constant speed, but the airflow from the Pack Flow Control Valve (FCV) can vary.) TEMPERATURE SENSORS There are two mixer unit temperature sensors, one on either side of the mixer unit. They give the actual temperature of the mixer unit to the Air Conditioning System Controllers (ASCSs). The cockpit mixer unit temperature sensor is connected to the ACSC 1 and the cabin mixer unit to the ACSC 2. Each mixer unit temperature sensor has two thermistors, one connected to lane 1 and the other to the second lane of the ACSC. MIXER UNIT FLAP The mixer unit flap ensures sufficient flight deck air supply if pack 1 is selected off. An electrically operated mixer unit flap is installed to ensure that sufficient fresh air is delivered to the cockpit in case of pack 1 failure.

Cabin zones demanding a higher temperature than that which is available from the mixer unit receive additional hot trim-air added by the trim air valve. The trim air valves are operated by ACSC 1 for the cockpit and ACSC 2 for the FWD and aft cabin zones. TRIM AIR PRV The trim air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) is pneumatically operated and electrically controlled by a solenoid. The solenoid controls the ON/OFF function. The trim air PRV regulates the pressure of the air supplied to the trim air valves, 4 psi above the cabin pressure. The ON/OFF function solenoid de-energizes when the HOT AIR P/B is set to OFF or when the temperature of any duct is above 88\u00b0C (190\u00b0F). This closes the valve. HOT AIR PRESSURE SWITCH Due to a malfunction of the trim air PRV, the hot air pressure switch signals overpressure to ACSCs 1 and 2 for ECAM display and the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) and monitoring. If pressure in the system is 6.5 psi greater than the cabin pressure, ACSC 1 sends a fault signal to ECAM. This signal stays until the pressure falls below 5 psi. TRIM AIR VALVES The trim air valves lets the zone temperature be adjusted by modulating the hot airflow added to air from the mixer unit. The trim air valves close when the trim air PRV closes. The butterfly of the trim air valves is controlled by a stepper motor. The trim air valve position is determined using the step-counting principle.

The ACSC sends data to the Electronic Control Box (ECB) and receives an APU bleed valve open discrete. The ACSC sends to the ECB the increase of APU flow used for increased bleed airflow. When the ECB sends a signal to the ACSC, the APU bleed valve open discrete is used for flow demand calculation. SDAC System data information is transmitted to the System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC) via ARINC buses for system monitoring. The system data information is used for warning and display. These data are temperature, valve position and others. EIU The ACSC sends data to both Engine Interface Units (EIUs). Each EIU sends one discrete to the ACSC. EIUs 1 and 2 send to the ACSC: - the take-off thrust used for pack ram air inlet closure, - the High Pressure (HP) fuel valve position used for bleed demand circulation and for engine start sequence, so that the pack Flow Control Valves (FCVs) are controlled to close during engine start. The ACSC sends to EIUs 1 and 2: - the engine power increase used for bleed airflow increase, - the bleed and the anti-ice status used for thrust limit calculation. CPC The Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC) 1 or 2 (depending who is in control) sends data to the ACSC for zone and pack temperature control. The A/C altitude is used for zone temperature compensation and pack water extractor outlet temperature limitation. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) FDIMU The ACSCs send system main status data to the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) for maintenance monitoring functions. The ACSC sends to the FDIMU: - the trim-air Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) position, - pack flow, water extractor and pack compressor discharge temperatures, BYPass valve and ram air inlet flap positions. CFDIU ACSC 2 sends BITE data to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) for system monitoring. The BITE data is used for temperature control system monitoring. Only the ASCS 2 is connected to the CFDIU. Therefore all BITE data from/to ACSC 1 are transmitted through the ACSC 2. AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CONTROLLERS The ACSCs mainly receive temperature and flow demands, CFDIU control signals and send back maintenance data signals. The ACSCs also receive a signal from the DITCHING P/B to close both pack FCVs if there is a ditching. ACSC 1 and 2 receive a signal from the engine FIRE P/B, to close the related pack FCV in case of engine fire. The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) Director 1 sends a data signal for ACSC 1, and the CIDS Director 2 sends a signal for ACSC 2 for CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 72 of 129 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY temperature regulation (+ or - 2.5\u00b0C) from the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP). FAN PARAMETERS The ACSCs receive discrete signals from recirculation and toilet fans for monitoring. The lavatory and galley extraction and the cabin recirculation fan operation are used for monitoring and transmission to the SDACs and CFDIU. ANTI-ICE AND PNEUMATIC PARAMETERS Anti-ice and pneumatic parameters are used to detect faults and to make sure that the status of the bleed air system is transmitted to the CFDIU and EIUs. The valve positions, low and high pressure, are used for anti-ice system fault detection for the CFDIU and thrust limit calculation for the EIUs. LGCIU 2 Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 2 sends a ground/flight signal to both ACSCs for pack air inlet flap operation. The ground/flight signal is used for pack ram air inlet flap closure during take-off and landing phases. BSCU The Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU) sends a wheel signal to both ACSCs for pack ram air inlet flap operation. The wheel speed is used for pack ram air inlet flap closure during take-off and landing phases.

EMERGENCY RAM AIR INLET FLAP OPERATION In case of failure of both packs in flight or a smoke removal in flight, an emergency ram air inlet flap can be opened for A/C ventilation. In case of smoke removal or loss of both packs, the RAM AIR P/B must be set to ON. When set to ON, and if DITCHING is not selected, the emergency ram air inlet flap opens. The flap, installed between the LP GND connection and ram air inlet, closes one side of the Y-duct when air is supplied from the other side. The check valve stays closed. The A/C must descend to less than 10000 ft. When the cabin differential pressure is less than 1 psi, the Cabin Pressure Controller in control half opens the outflow valve. The air then goes through the check valve to the mixing unit.

When manual mode is used, the manual part of controller 1 operates only as a back-up indication circuit processing outputs for indicating and monitoring. CPC 1 manual part outputs for monitoring and indicating are: FWC and SDAC. CPC 2 manual part is not used. OUTFLOW VALVE In automatic mode, the outflow valve is controlled by the operating controller. The outflow valve is of the double flap and motor driven type. In automatic operation, the outflow valve is operated by electronics module 1 or module 2 depending on the operating controller: - electronics module 1 is controlled by controller 1, controller 1 plus motor 1 are linked to system 1, - electronics module 2 is controlled by controller 2, controller 2 plus motor 2 are linked to system 2. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) Two electronic actuators interface with the controllers. A pressure switch, which only operates in automatic mode, is installed in each electronic actuator. It closes the applicable outflow valve in case of cabin altitude above 15000 ft. Motor 3 is controlled from the CABIN PRESSure panel by the MANual Vertical/Speed ConTroL toggle switch when manual mode is selected on the MODE SELection P/B. The manual motor is used in case of failure of systems 1 and 2. The outflow valve position monitoring is based on a triple potentiometer principle. Potentiometer 1(2) generates a feedback signal, sent to CPC 1(2) through electronic actuator 1(2). It is used for indication and initialization functions in automatic operation. Potentiometer 3 generates a feedback signal, sent straight to the CPC 1 manual backup part. It is used as indication function in manual operation only. SAFETY VALVES The safety valves prevent excessive positive and negative differential pressure (DELTA P) in the fuselage. They are installed on the aft pressure bulkhead above the A/C flotation line. The safety valves are poppet-type pneumatic valves. They operate independently. RPCU The RPCU interfaces with the CPCs and takes over the control of the outflow valves automatically if the outflow valve is not in the fully open position when the aircraft is on ground. This is to prevent any door violent opening in case of residual cabin pressure. The control of the Outflow Valve (OFV) by the Residual Pressure Control System (RPCU) is done through the MOT 3, when the following situation is detected: - both main landing gears are compressed, or one main landing gear is compressed and the Parking Brake is set to ON, and - both Master Switches are in OFF or speed is below 100 knots AND CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 80 of 129 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY - outflow valve is not fully open, and - cabin pressurization system is in manual mode or both CPCs are inoperative.

The signals are: - Thrust lever angle in Takeoff (TO) position, - MAXimum CONTinuous or FLeXible detent, - N2 at or above idle, used for pre-pressurization and pressurization sequences. LGCIU Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a flight/ground signal to both controllers to initiate pre-pressurization, pressurization and depressurization sequences. The ground/flight signal is used for pre-pressurization, pressurization, depressurization sequences and system transfer. ADIRU MOTORS A discrete signal from the active controller will select the corresponding motor and enable signal, while outflow valve positioning and monitoring signals are transmitted by RS 422 buses. The signals in AUTO MODE are: - \"enable signal\" to motor in control, - outflow valve positioning and monitoring. In MANUAL MODE, the feedback position from motor 3 is sent to controller 1. The Residual Pressure Control Unit (R PCU) controls the residual pressure in the cabin and takes over the control of the outflow valve automatically by providing power directly to the manual motor (motor 3). CONTROLLER 1/CONTROLLER 2 Each Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) sends the static pressure and the barometric correction signals to both controllers for pressure control. These signals are: - Static pressure, - BARO (barometric) correction, - ADIRU validity, used for all sequences and priority selection. ADIRU 1, 2, 3 sends signals to controller 1 and ADIRU 2, 1, 3 sends signals to controller 2. FMGC Each Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) sends cruise flight level and landing field elevation data to both controllers. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) The signals are: - Cruise flight level, - Landing field elevation, used for pressurization profile. Discrete signals between both controllers ensure controller transfer. The system 1 or 2 active signal is used for controller transfer. AIR COND PANEL AND CABIN PRESS PANEL The position of the pressure panel switches and emergency RAM AIR switch is transmitted to both controllers. The CABIN PRESSurization panel signals are: - ditching, - landing field elevation selection, - manual mode selection, used for manual operation. The AIR CONDitioning panel signal is the emergency ram air inlet selection, used for outflow valve half opening.

MANUAL MODE The calculation of the cabin altitude in the MANual mode is done in the Display Management Computer (DMC) to standard atmosphere. The Cabin Pressure Control System (CPCS) manual backup circuit supplies a cabin pressure value to the SDAC. Thus, there can be a small difference in the cabin altitude values between the AUTO and MAN modes if the aircraft altitude is higher than 5000 ft above take-off or landing fields. There can be a difference between the cabin altitude values due to the barometric conditions (weather) if the aircraft altitude is lower than 5000 ft above take-off or landing fields. The active CPC uses the auto-motor to control the outflow valve to the requested position. It also supplies data for indication on the Electronic Instrumentation System (EIS). Only one CPC operates the system at a time, while the other system is in hot standby. The change of control from one CPC to the other is fully automatic after each flight, on landing. The CPCs will also change in flight if there is a failure of one of the control systems. MANUAL OPERATION The MAN V/S toggle switch controls the manual motor of the outflow valve when the MAN SEL switch is selected to MAN. These controls are installed in the cockpit, on the CABIN PRESS overhead panel. In manual mode, the backup channel of the CPC in position no. 1 is used. It has a pressure sensor to start the excess cabin altitude warning and pressure outputs for the indication on the EIS. If the MAN Part of CPC1 is active, the data for indication on EIS come from the ADIRUs and the SDAC. PRESSURIZATION CONTROL SYSTEM AUTOMATIC OPERATION The system has two identical, independent, automatic systems. Each system has a CPC, which controls the pressure through a flap-type outflow valve. In the automatic operation, the CPCs use the data from the Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS) and the ADIRS.

This warning is generated if cabin altitude exceeds 9550ft. A manual mode selection signal is sent from the pressure panel to both SDACs. The MANual MODE SEL signal is used for ECAM display. NOTE: Note: Each manual part is a separate, electrically supplied part. SDAC SAFETY VALVES/SDAC The safety valve position signals are sent to both SDAC. The safety valve position signal is used for ECAM display. Both controllers send ARINC and discrete signals to the System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC). When the system is in automatic mode, ARINC and discrete signals are used for monitoring and warning indications. In manual mode, 3 analog signals are provided from the manual part of CPC1 only. CFDIU Both controllers send BITE data to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) via ARINC buses. This data is sent continuously or on request. The signal is a BITE data, used for Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) monitoring. CIDS In case of excessive cabin altitude, the pressure controllers send a discrete signal to the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS). The cabin altitude exceeding 11300 ft signal is used for passenger signs. CABIN PRESS PANEL In case of failure of both automatic systems, the controllers send a discrete signal to the pressure panel for FAULT light illumination.

Air is taken from different sources depending on the A/C configuration and ambient conditions. Ventilation air is blown to the equipment by a blower fan and extracted by an extraction fan. The cockpit temperature sensor for the temperature control system is connected to the extraction part of the avionics ventilation. LAVatories and galleys The lavatory (LAV) and galleys (GALY) ventilation system is used to remove unpleasant odors before they enter the cabin. Ventilation air is supplied from cabin distribution ducts and discharged overboard via the outflow valve by an extraction fan. The FWD and AFT cabin zones temperature sensors are connected to the lavatory and galley extraction system. CARGO The FWD and aft cargo compartments are ventilated by cabin ambient air coming from the cabin zones through openings in the cabin floor behind the sidewall panels. The FWD cargo compartment is ventilated by means of an extraction fan or by differential pressure. The aft cargo compartment is ventilated by means of an extraction fan only. NOTE: Note: The ventilation system is optional and independent for each compartment. CONTrollers The Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) ensures control and monitoring of the AVNCS ventilation system. The cargo ventilation controller (CONT) controls and monitors the isolation valves and the extraction fan of the cargo ventilation system.

The valve is equipped with a handle which is used to crank the valve open or closed. When the Skin Air Inlet Valve is deactivated CLOSED, the Conditioned Air Inlet Valve must be deactivated to the OPEN position. This allows supplemental cooling from the cockpit air conditioning supply for the avionics equipment when the normal supply is affected. The conditioned air inlet valve is located in the avionics compartment. The valve is equipped with a manual lever/position indicator which may be used to put the valve in the OPEN position. Deactivation procedure: - push latch to release the handle from the valve, - pull the handle to engage the splines, - set the Deactivation switch to OFF, - turn the handle counter-clockwise until the flap is closed, - stow and latch the handle, - remove the electrical connector from the Conditioned Air Inlet Valve and move the manual override handle to the OPEN position, - perform AEVC BITE. AVIONICS VENTILATION CONDITIONED AIR INLET VALVE In addition to the Skin Air Inlet Valve deactivation, other ventilation system deactivation tasks also include deactivation of the Conditioned Air Inlet Valve in the OPEN position. These affected components are: - the blower fan, - the extract fan, - the ventilation filter.

In this configuration, the ventilation BLOWER fan pulls air in from the open Skin Air Inlet Valve on the LH side of the fuselage. The air is circulated through the ventilation system and then the EXTRACTION fan discharges the air overboard through the open Skin Air Outlet Valve. If maintenance is being performed on the aircraft in heavy rain conditions with the ventilation system in the OPEN configuration, the blower fan may draw water into the ventilation system and subsequently, into the aircraft computers. To prevent water ingestion, the ventilation system should be put in the CLOSED configuration by selecting the EXTRACT pushbutton to OverRriDe (OVRD) on the VENTILATION panel. For additional cooling in the CLOSED configuration, select the packs ON. If the Skin Air INLET or OUTLET valve fails on the ground and no replacement part is available, either valve may be manually operated to the OPEN position. This will allow cooling for the avionics equipment if the aircraft is powered for maintenance operations. Before flight, the failed valve must be deactivated in the proper configuration.

It computes orders and sends them to the Electrical Flight Control System (EFCS) and to the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) to control flying surfaces and engines. When the AFS is not active, the above-mentioned components are controlled by the same systems but orders are generated by specific devices: side sticks and thrust levers. If the pilot moves the side stick when the AFS is active, it disengages the autopilot. Back to manual flight, when the sidestick is released, the EFCS maintains the actual aircraft attitude. NAVIGATION A fundamental function of the AFS is to calculate the aircraft position. To compute the aircraft position, the system uses several aircraft sensors, which give useful information for this purpose. SYSTEM DESIGN To meet the necessary reliability, the AFS is built around 4 computers. There are two interchangeable Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) and two interchangeable Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs). It is a FAIL OPERATIVE system. Each FMGC and FAC has a command part and a monitor part to be FAIL PASSIVE. FLIGHT PLAN The AFS has several flight plans predetermined by the airline in its memory. A flight plan describes a complete flight from departure to arrival; it gives vertical information and all intermediate waypoints. The plan can be displayed on the EFIS or on the Multipurpose Control & Display Units (MCDU). OPERATION There are several ways to use the AFS but the normal and recommended one is to use it to follow the flight plan automatically. Knowing the position of the aircraft and the flight plan chosen by the pilot, the system is able to compute the orders sent to the flying surfaces and the engines so that the aircraft follows the flight plan. The pilot has an important monitoring role. NOTE: During AFS operation, side sticks and thrust levers do not move automatically.

The AFS is designed around: - 2 Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs), - 2 Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs), - 2 Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDUs), - 1 Flight Control Unit (FCU). CONTROLS The FCU and the MCDUs let the pilots control the functions of the FMGCs. The FAC engagement P/BSWs and the RUDder TRIM control panel are connected to the FACs. The MCDUs are used for long-term control of the aircraft and do the interface between the crew and the FMGC allowing the management of the flight. The FCU is used for short-term control of the aircraft and is the interface required for transmission of engine data from the FMGC to the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). NOTE: The FAC includes an interface between the AFS and the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) called Fault Isolation and Detection System (FIDS). OTHER SYSTEMS The AFS is connected to the majority of the aircraft systems. Examples of AFS data exchanges: - reception of the aircraft altitude and attitude from the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS), - transmission of autopilot orders to the ELevator and Aileron Computers (ELACs). FMGC There are two interchangeable FMGCs. Each FMGC is made of two parts: the Flight Management (FM) part and the Flight Guidance (FG) part. The FM part gives the functions related to flight plan definition, revision and monitoring and the FG part gives the functions related to the aircraft control. FAC There are two interchangeable FACs. The basic functions of the FACs are the rudder control and the flight envelope protection.

Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 10 of 142 COMPONENT LOCATION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 11 of 142 FAC GENERAL (2) FUNCTIONS The basic functions of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) are: - yaw damper, - rudder trim, - rudder travel limitation, - flight envelope protection, - Fault Isolation and Detection System (FIDS). YAW DAMPER The yaw damper has four functions and controls the rudder via yaw damper actuators. Upon Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC), ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) or FAC orders, the yaw damper provides: - dutch roll damping, - turn coordination in cruise, - engine failure compensation in auto flight, - yaw guidance order execution. RUDDER TRIM The rudder trim orders come from the RUDder TRIM selector, or from the FMGC to control the rudder via the rudder trim actuator. The rudder trim gives: - the manual trim with RUD TRIM selector, - auto trim on yaw axis and the generation of engine failure recovery function when the autopilot is engaged. RUDDER TRAVEL LIMITATION The rudder travel limiting unit limits the deflection of the rudder according to the aircraft speed. The rudder travel limiting function: - limits the deflection for structure integrity, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) - prevents excessive deflections which would penalize the aircraft performance. Aircraft speed information is given by the Air Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs). FLIGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION For flight envelope protection, the FAC computes the various characteristic speeds for aircraft operation, the low energy warning, the excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) and wind shear detections. The characteristic speeds are computed using data from the ADIRU, the Landing Gear Control Interface Unit (LGCIU), the FMGC, and the Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC). Then, they are displayed on the PFDs. The alpha floor (excessive AOA) and wind shear detections are sent to the FMGCs. The low energy warning computation is sent to the Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) which generate an aural warning: \"SPEED, SPEED, SPEED\". FIDS For maintenance purposes, the FIDS centralizes the failure information from the various BITE of the AFS computers and provides an interface between these BITEs and the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). The FIDS function is only active in FAC 1. CONTROLS Each FAC receives inputs from its related P/BSW, the RUD TRIM selector and the RUD TRIM RESET P/B. The RUD TRIM selector deflects the rudder. The RESET P/B returns the rudder to the neutral position. DISPLAYS Some of the data computed by the FAC is displayed: - the characteristic speeds are displayed on the speed scale of the PFDs. CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 12 of 142 - the rudder trim position is displayed on the F/CTL ECAM page and on the RUD TRIM control panel.

Typical actions are: - before departure, on the MCDUs, the pilots select the flight plan which will be followed later on by the aircraft. - in flight, on the FCU, the pilots can engage the AP and can modify different flight parameters leading to an immediate change in the control of the aircraft. The FM part mainly gives the flight plan selection with its lateral and vertical functions. The FM part gives the navigation, performance optimization, radio navigation tuning and information display management. Data computed by the FM part is occasionally used by the FG part. MCDU LATERAL FUNCTIONS Basically, the MCDUs give the long-term interface between the crew and the FMGCs. The MCDUs show, for example: - the introduction or the definition, the modification and the display of flight plans, - the display, the selection and the modification of the parameters associated with the FM functions, - the selection of specific functions. The main lateral functions are: - aircraft position determination, - Inertial Reference System (IRS) alignment through the MCDU, - automatic or manual (through MCDU) selection of VOR, DME, ILS, ADF frequencies, - guidance computation along the lateral flight plan. A navigation database supplies all necessary information to build a flight plan; however pilots can enter other data using the MCDU. FCU VERTICAL FUNCTIONS Basically, the FCU gives the short-term interface between the crew and the FMGCs. For example, the FCU can be used for: - the engagement of the AP, Flight Director (FD) and A/THR functions, - the selection of required guidance modes (e.g. heading hold), - the selection of various flight parameters (e.g. heading value). The main vertical functions are: - optimized speed computation; the resulting target speed being used as reference for guidance functions, - performance predictions as time, fuel, altitude, wind at various points of the flight, - guidance computation along the vertical flight plan. A performance database supplies necessary data; however pilots have to enter other data using the MCDU. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd FLIGHT PLAN A flight plan contains the various elements and constraints of the route the aircraft must fly along from take-off to landing. A flight plan can be selected, built-up, modified and monitored through the MCDU. Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 18 of 142 DISPLAYS GUIDANCE GENERAL GENERAL The FG part gives the AP, FD and A/THR functions. These functions work according to modes generally chosen on the FCU. The normal way to operate the aircraft is to use the management part as reference source for the guidance part. Various displays are used to present Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS) data and information. The main displays presenting flight management and guidance information are: - the MCDUs (display part), - the FCU (display Part), - the PFDs, - the NDs, - the ECAM/EWD and ECAM STATUS pages. AP The AP function calculates the signals for the flight controls in order to follow the selected modes. The AP controls the pitch, roll and yaw axis according to the selected modes. Example of AP mode: Altitude hold. MCDU The MCDUs display all data related to the management part. Example: Identification of the successive waypoints of the flight plan. FD The FD displays the guidance commands on both PFDs, allowing the pilots to fly the aircraft manually according to the FMGC demands. Two cases have to be considered: AP not engaged: - the FD function displays symbols on the PFD which gives orders to the pilot to maintain the desired parameter(s). In this case, the pilot follows these orders by acting on the flight controls. AP engaged: - the FD function displays symbols on the PFDs representing the AP orders to be monitored by the pilot. A/THR The A/THR function calculates the signal necessary for engine control in order to follow a given mode. Example of A/THR mode: Acquisition and holding of a speed or a Mach number. FCU The FCU is also considered as a display as it includes indication lights and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) windows. The FCU includes: - lights giving mode indications, - LCD windows showing reference parameters. Example: During a climb with AP, the altitude window displays the altitude the aircraft is going to capture. PFD The PFDs mainly display the FD symbols and the status of guidance functions and their modes. They also display reference parameters. Example: The target speed value is represented by a symbol on the speed scale of the PFD. ND The NDs mainly display the flight plan and various navigation data. Example: Airports or waypoints around the present position of the aircraft.

AP engagement is indicated by the illumination of the AP 1 P/BSW or/and the AP 2 P/BSW (Three green bars) and by the white \"AP1\", \"AP2\" or \"AP1+ 2\" indication on the top right corner of each PFD. The AP guidance modes are selected from the FCU or the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs). The AP function is a loop where, after a comparison between real and reference parameters, the FMGC computes orders, which are sent to the flight controls. The loop is closed by real values coming from sensors and given by other systems (e.g. ADIRS) to the FMGCs. When the AP is engaged, the load thresholds on the rudder pedals and the side sticks are increased. If a pedal or side stick load threshold is overridden, the AP disengages. The AP can be engaged in flight, provided the aircraft has been airborne for at least 5 seconds. MODES If the airfield is equipped with ILS installations, the AP can perform a complete landing with approach, flare and roll out. A second AP can be engaged (AP 1 active, AP 2 in standby). There are lateral modes and vertical modes. Basically, one of each is chosen by the pilot or by the system. The AP being engaged, one lateral mode and one vertical mode are simultaneously active. According to flight phases, the lateral mode controls: - the ailerons via the ELevator Aileron Computers (ELACs), - the spoilers via the ELACs and the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs), - the rudder via the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs), - the nose wheel via the ELACs and the Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU). The vertical mode controls the elevators and the THS via the ELACs. GROUND CRUISE In cruise, only one AP can be engaged at a time, priority given to the last engaged. Engaging the second AP disengages the first one. The ailerons and the spoilers execute the orders of lateral modes; the elevators and the THS execute the orders of vertical modes. NOTE: The rudder is controlled not by the AP but directly by the FACs. LANDING NOTE: The rudder is controlled by the AP via the FACs. During roll out, the AP gives steering orders to the rudder and the nose wheel. These orders depend on the aircraft speed. Aileron and spoiler AP orders are null. The THS is reset to 0.5 nose up. NOTE: The spoilers are directly controlled by the SECs as airbrakes. During roll out, at low speed (about 60 knots), the pilot normally disengages the AP by pressing a takeover pushbutton located on the side stick. For maintenance purposes, the AP can be engaged on ground with both engines shut down. Hydraulic power is not required. When an engine is started, the AP disengages.

A non lit FD P/BSW means that no FD symbols can be displayed on the corresponding PFD. -FD2 is displayed on each PFD to show that no FD symbols can be displayed on PFD 1 and FD 2 is engaged on the F/O side. NOTE: On ground, as long as no AP/FD mode is active, there are no FD symbols on the PFDs. PRINCIPLE The FD displays the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) guidance commands on both PFDs. In manual flight, the FD displays guidance orders to help the pilots to apply commands on the controls in order to follow the optimum flight path, which would be ordered by the AP if it was engaged. When the AP is engaged, the FD helps the FMGC demands to be checked. The FD modes are the same as the AP modes and are selected the same way. The FMGCs calculate AP/FD orders which are transformed into symbols by the Display Management Computers (DMCs). There are two types of symbols: the FD bars, the Flight Path Director (FPD) and Flight Path Vector (FPV) symbols. The central HeaDinG-Vertical Speed (HDG-V/S)/TRacK-Flight Path Angle (TRK-FPA) P/BSW on the FCU makes the pilots switch between these two types of symbols. FD PUSHBUTTONS Upon FCU power up, in go around, or when losing the AP during the roll out phase of the landing, the three green bars of the FD P/BSWs come on automatically. A lit FD P/BSW means that the FD symbols can be displayed on the corresponding PFD: PFD 1 for the CAPT FD P/BSW Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 24 of 142 ENGAGEMENT ...

The FPV symbol position is computed by the Air Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRS). FD BARS The FD bars can be displayed provided HDG-V/S is selected on the FCU. HDG-V/S is automatically selected at system power up. NOTE: The yaw bar is identical to the FD bar case and appears with the same conditions. NOTE: At certain system configuration changes, the FMGCs send a command to the DMCs to make the FD bars flash for 10 seconds. AP/FD modes are correctly followed when the FD bars are centered on the fixed aircraft model of the PFDs. There are three FD bars: - the pitch bar, - the roll bar, - and the yaw bar. The horizontal pitch bar can be displayed if a vertical mode is active except during the roll out phase of the landing. The vertical roll bar can be displayed if a lateral mode is active. Below 30 feet RA at take-off when a LOCalizer (LOC) signal is available and during landing, the roll bar is replaced by a yaw bar index. This bar is then centered when it is just below the central yellow square. FPD/FPV SYMBOLS The FPD and the FPV symbols can be displayed provided TRK-FPA is selected on the FCU. NOTE: At certain system configuration changes, the FMGCs send a command to the DMCs to make the FPD and FPV symbols flash for 10 seconds. AP/FD modes are correctly followed when the FPD and FPV symbols are superimposed. The FPD symbol supplies command signals to intercept and fly the lateral and vertical flight path as defined by the FMGCs. The FPD symbol is removed if no guidance mode is provided by the FMGCs. The FPV symbol represents lateral and vertical flight path information Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 26 of 142 FD BARS & FPD/FPV SYMBOLS Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 27 of 142 AUTOTHRUST PRESENTATION (2) AUTOTHRUST FUNCTION The A/THR function sends a computed thrust command (thrust target) to the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) for automatic engine control. The A/THR functions are: - acquisition and holding of a speed or a Mach number, - acquisition and holding of a thrust, - reduction of the thrust to idle during descent and during flare in final approach, - protection against excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) called alpha-floor protection, by ordering a maximum thrust when an alpha-floor detection signal is received from the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs). AUTOTHRUST LOOP PRINCIPLE To get the A/THR function, the thrust target computed by the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) is chosen by the Flight Control Unit (FCU). Then each FCU processor sends, along its own bus, the thrust target to the FADEC via the Engine Interface Units (EIUs). When A/THR is engaged: - the FCU A/THR P/BSW is lit, - the engagement status is displayed on the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA). When engaged, the A/THR can be active or not depending on the position of the thrust levers. When engaged and not active, the thrust control is manual. The thrust is commanded according to the position of the thrust levers. When engaged and active, the thrust control is automatic. The thrust is commanded according to the A/THR computed thrust target. AUTOTHRUST DISCONNECTION A/THR disengagement can be manual or automatic. A/THR is manually disconnected: - either by pressing the A/THR instinctive disconnect switch on any thrust lever, - or by setting all thrust levers to idle position, - or through the dedicated FCU P/BSW, A/THR is automatically disconnected in case of failure detection. AUTOTHRUST ENGAGEMENT The engagement of the A/THR function can be manual or automatic. The A/THR is engaged manually by pressing the A/THR P/BSW on the FCU. This is inhibited below 100 feet RA, with engines running. The A/THR is engaged automatically: - when the AP/Flight Director (FD) is engaged in Take-Off (TO) or Go Around (GA) modes, - or in flight, when the alpha-floor is detected; this is inhibited below 100 feet RA except during the 15 seconds following the lift-off. NOTE: To effectively have A/THR on the engines, the engagement of the A/THR is confirmed by a logic of activation in the FADEC.

The line maintenance of the AFS is based on the use of the Fault Isolation and Detection System (FIDS) active in the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) 1 and of the BITEs located in the various AFS computers. Access to the fault data is made through the Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDUs) via the CFDIU. Like for other systems, the CFDIU works in NORMAL mode and MENU mode (See ATA 31-CFDS). According to its internal architecture, each AFS Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) has one or several BITEs. The basic purpose of a BITE is to detect, isolate, memorize failures, the Flight Control Unit (FCU) and MCDU BITEs only perform the detection task. The failure detection is triggered by specific events listed in the maintenance manual. Example of Flight Guidance (FG) CoMmanD (CMD) triggering event: ILS own failure. The failure localization corresponds to an analysis processed to identify the source of the failure. FIDS The FIDS is a card physically located in each FAC. Both FACs are interchangeable, but only the FAC 1 FIDS is active due to the side 1 signal. The FIDS is used as a system BITE to concentrate maintenance information. The FIDS is linked in acquisition and reception to the CFDIU and is connected to the BITEs of the various AFS computers. It receives commands from the CFDIU, interprets these commands and transfers them, if applicable, to the various BITEs concerned. It receives malfunction reports from the BITEs, manages these reports, and, if applicable, consolidates the BITE diagnosis (occurrence, correlation...) and generates a fault message, which is sent to the CFDIU. NOTE: If the FIDS fails, the BITEs continue to work and the results can be read in the shop or after FAC 1 change. The NORMAL mode function is the same as in other systems. In addition to the usual system report functions, the MENU mode gives access to GROUND SCAN, AFS TEST and LAND TEST. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) FAC/FM/FG BITE As the FAC and FG have a BITE in the CMD and the MONitor (MON) sides, the fault analysis is generally made on each side and a synthesis is made on the CMD side. Each BITE memorizes the result of the analysis, the failure context, the flight leg number, the time and date of each given failure. Then the BITE sends the result of the analysis, with a maximum of two suspected LRUs in the order of probability, to the FIDS. FCU BITE Each FCU BITE computes the maintenance status of its related part and permanently sends this maintenance data to the FG CMD part. MCDU BITE The MCDU does the tests on its processor, memory and display unit. If a failure is found by the MCDU BITE: - the FAIL annunciator comes on and the display is blank, - the MCDU FAIL output discrete is set and sent to the FM part and then to FG 1 and FG 2 CMD parts through the crosstalk bus.

The PRESENT FAILURE SCAN function is used to isolate failures present when the function is selected. The manufacturer for development purposes uses the PROGRAM page. AFS TEST An AFS TEST is done: - to check an AFS LRU before removal, - to check an AFS LRU after installation, - to get trouble shooting data (even if the test is OK). LAND TEST The LAND TEST gives the test availability of the LANDing mode and equipment required to obtain CATegory 3. There are several successive pages in which actions, checks and answers are requested from maintenance.

These tests are only done on ground, except for the FCU, which can make safety tests on ground or in flight. During these tests, no action should be done on the system. If a unit does not pass the safety test, it is declared failed and unusable and an ECAM message is displayed on the STATUS page. NOTE: The recommended conditions to do the safety test are: . aircraft on ground, engines stopped, hydraulic power (green/yellow) for FAC only, . pull the C/B of the involved computer (both C/Bs for FCU), . wait 15 seconds (7 minutes for FCU), and then push the C/B of the involved computer, . wait 1 minute for safety test execution.

The yaw damper order calculated by the ELAC provides turn coordination; dutch roll damping and engine failure compensation. If both ELACs fail, only the dutch roll damping (alternate law) is computed by the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) using the Air Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) data. When the AP is engaged, the FAC calculates the yaw damper order except in LANDing mode where it is computed by the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC). When the AP is engaged: - dutch roll damping law is given by the FAC using ADIRS data. - engine failure compensation fast law is given by the FAC using the ADIRS data in Take-Off/Go-Around (TOGA) or RunWaY modes only. - turn coordination law computes the yaw order to the FMGC roll order. In LAND mode, the FMGC yaw order controls the yaw damper actuators via the FAC. The rudder travel limitation is computed by the FAC and sent to the rudder travel limiting unit. The FAC rudder travel limiting law computes this limit using the calibrated airspeed (Vc) given by the ADIRS. OPERATION ELAC NORMAL LAW This schematic represents the ELAC normal law. RUDDER TRIM The RUDder TRIM selector via the FAC controls the rudder trim in manual mode. In the rudder trim auto mode, the FAC computes the engine failure compensation and the turn coordination. When the AP is engaged: - the turn coordination law computes the yaw orders related to the FMGC roll order. Signals are simultaneously sent to the rudder trim actuator and the yaw damper actuators. - the engine failure compensation slow law orders are sent to the rudder trim actuator.

As soon as the AP is engaged, the yaw damper operates in the mode given below: - Dutch roll damping - Turn coordination to reduce the sideslip in turn as a product of the roll order from the FMGC. Additionally, for the rudder trim operation in automatic mode the autopilot has priority thus, the manual pilot trim is not possible in AP engaged configuration. The order for rudder trim deflection is a product of the turn coordination and (in the event of an engine failure) engine fail compensation. The AP also provides signals which validate the detection of engine failure as a function of the engine rating. In all cases the rudder trim deflection is always indicated on the rudder trim control panel.

In TOGA/RWY mode the yaw damper will now include engine failure compensation in the event of an engine failure. This mode provides lateral guidance function, at takeoff, on the runway centerline by means of the LOC beam and by following an optimum longitudinal flight path after rotation. This mode is available: - for the FD during takeoff run and in flight - for the AP 5 seconds after lift-off. The mode is engaged when the pilot selects the takeoff thrust by positioning the throttle control levers beyond the MCT/FLX TO gate.

In normal operation, both are engaged but only one is active. Yaw damper 1 has priority. The yaw damper function is achieved by: - 2 electro-hydraulic actuators with an external centering element. Each actuator comprises 1 jack, 1 Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT), 2 solenoid valves, 2 selector valves, 1 pressure switch and 1 Servo Valve (SV). - 2 Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs). - 2 Rotary Variable Differential Transducers (RVDTs). In AUTOmatic mode, the FAC computes the dutch roll damping in clean configuration, the engine failure compensation in Takeoff/Go-Around (TOGA) and RunWaY modes. The turn coordination law is computed by using roll orders from the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC). GENERAL In manual mode, the AP is not engaged and the ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) sends to the FAC: - the turn coordination, - the dutch roll damping, - the engine failure compensation yaw orders. MANUAL ALTERNATE After a dual ELAC failure, turn coordination and engine failure compensation are lost. Only a simplified alternate law of dutch roll damping is computed by the FAC. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) When the LANDing mode is engaged, the yaw order is computed directly by the FMGC. POWER LOOP Yaw damper 1 and 2 operate with the changeover logic. The yaw damper actuator does not move the rudder pedals. The yaw damper function operates as follows: - order is computed by the laws and sent to the rudder via the related yaw damper actuator. - yaw damper actuator 1 is powered by the green hydraulic system. - yaw damper actuator 2 is powered by the yellow hydraulic system. MANUAL MODE LAND MODE The yaw damper laws control the SV, and the changeover logic controls the two solenoids S1 and S2, which in turn control the selector valves (H). S1 and S2 when powered, move the internal hydraulic parts to a position, which makes it possible for the SV to operate the output jack. If one of the selector valves fails or the signal from the FAC 1 fails, the hydraulic Press switch sends a fail signal to the changeover logic, which then transfer the operation to YD 2. The feedback in the power loop is given by an LVDT for the command side and a RVDT for the monitor side. In case of dual yaw damper loss, a centering spring rod moves the rudder to the neutral position. MONITORING At power up, the yaw damper function safety tests are initiated. The continuity between the standby yaw damper and its SV is tested. The computation is monitored by the comparators between command and monitor part. The ELAC, FMGC and Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) peripheral inputs are always monitored. The power loop is monitored by a comparator between the yaw order and the rudder position CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 64 of 142 feedback. In flight, the hydraulic pressures are monitored by the FAC. The LVDTs and the RVDTs are always monitored.

This function gives: - characteristic speeds on the PFDs through the Display Management Computers (DMCs), - the speed limits to the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) for autoflight, - the alpha-floor detection to the FMGCs for A/THR engagement, if it is not engaged, - low energy awareness. The FAC also computes the weight and the center of gravity. SPEED COMPUTATION DISPLAY The speeds computed by the FAC are sent to the PFD and the speed limits to the FMGCs. In normal operation, FAC 1 data are displayed on the CAPT PFD and the FAC 2 data on the F/O PFD. If a parameter or the computer fails, the associated PFD is automatically switched to the opposite FAC by the DMC. If the air data source used by the FAC is different from the data source used by the DMC for speed display, the message ADR DISAGREE appears on the ECAM. SPEED COMPUTATION Aerodynamic laws and the aircraft configuration parameters are used for the characteristic speed computation. The computation principle is based on the fact that most of the speed data are a function of the aircraft weight. In flight, the FAC computes the weight with the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS), FMGC and Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC) parameters and then, from the weight, it computes the characteristic speeds and the Center of Gravity (CG). On the ground, the FAC uses the weight given by the FMGC. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 68 of 142 GENERAL ...

This function is a protection of the aircraft against excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA). The FAC compares the aircraft AOA (alpha) with the predetermined threshold (function of the slat/flap configuration). This threshold is decreased if windshear occurs. NOTE: If a windshear condition is detected, the red WINDSHEAR message is displayed on the PFD and the audio warning \"WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR\" starts. If this threshold is exceeded, the FAC sends a signal to the FMGC to engage the A/THR function and apply full thrust. If the aircraft is in clean configuration, the windshear compensation function is not available. The ELAC will start the alpha-floor protection if one of these conditions occurs: - alpha protection condition and side stick deflection > 14 degrees, - pitch angle > 25 degrees and side stick deflection > 14 degrees. If there is a failure of the two ADIRS, the alpha-floor detection does not operate.

This warning tells the crew that it is necessary to increase the thrust to get back a positive flight path angle through pitch control. The audio warning, \"SPEED SPEED SPEED\", starts before alpha-floor in relation to the AOA, to the configuration deceleration rate and to the flight path angle. It is inhibited when RA is greater than 2000 ft or when alpha-floor is active or when the aircraft is in clean configuration.

SPEED PROTECTION = (VMO + 6 kts / MMO + 0.01). SPEED TREND The yellow pointer starts from the speed symbol. The end of this arrow gives the speed value, which will be attained in 10 seconds if the acceleration or deceleration remains constant. This arrow appears only when greater than 2 kts and is removed when less than 1 kt. It is also removed in case of failure of the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs). TARGET AIRSPEED This symbol is either magenta or cyan and gives the target airspeed value or the airspeed corresponding to the Mach number. The target airspeed value is the value computed by the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) in managed speed mode (magenta) or manually entered on Flight Control Unit (FCU) for selected speed mode (cyan). The target speed is a magenta double bar when associated with the ECONomy speed range. Otherwise it is a magenta or cyan triangle. When out of speed scale, the target speed value is displayed in numeric form below or above the speed scale. ECON SPEED RANGE In descent mode, with the ECON mode, the selected speed symbol is replaced by two magenta half triangles on EIS 1 or by two magenta thick lines on EIS 2: upper and lower limits calculated by the FMGC. They indicate the range of descent speed: +20 kts and -20 kts or Vmin or VLS whichever is higher.

The VLS corresponds to 1.13 Vs during take-off or following touch and go. It becomes 1.23 Vs as soon as any flap or slat selection is made. It remains at this value until landing. Above 20000 ft, VLS is corrected for Mach effect to maintain 0.2 g buffet margin. VLS information is inhibited from touch down up to 10 seconds after lift-off. The top of a red and black strip along the speed scale defines the Stall Warning Speed (VSW). It represents the speed corresponding to the stall warning. VSW information is inhibited from touch down up to five seconds after lift-off. The FACs computes the VSW in pitch alternate or pitch direct law. ALPHA PROTECTION SPEED The top of a black and amber strip along the speed scale defines the alpha protection speed. It represents the speed corresponding to the Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) at which alpha protection becomes active. The FACs compute this speed in pitch normal law. ALPHA MAX SPEED The top of a red strip along the speed scale defines the alpha max speed. It represents the speed corresponding to the maximum AOA that may be reached in pitch normal law. The FACs computes this speed in pitch normal law. VMAX It is defined by the lower end of a red and black strip along the speed scale and determined by the FACs. Vmax represents the lowest of the following values: - VMO (maximum operating speed) or the speed corresponding to MMO (Maximum Operating Mach), - VLE (maximum landing gear extended speed), - VFE (maximum flap extended speed). DECISION SPEED (V1) The decision speed V1 is shown by a cyan symbol. The crew through the Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU) manually inserts the decision speed. When out of indication range, it is digitally shown on the upper part of the scale. It is removed after lift-off. MINIMUM FLAP RETRACTION SPEED This speed is represented by a green -F symbol. It is available when the flap selector is in position 3 or 2. It is computed by the FACs. MINIMUM SLAT RETRACTION SPEED This speed is represented by a green -S symbol. It is available when the flap selector is in position 1. It is computed by the FACs. VFE NEXT Two amber dashes show the predicted VFE at the next flap/slat position. It is given by the FACs and only displayed when the aircraft altitude is below 15000 ft. GREEN DOT This is the engine out operating speed in clean configuration. It is displayed in flight only by a green dot. It represents the speed corresponding to the best lift to drag ratio.

When the windshear detection function is inoperative, the aural warning sounds, the MASTER CAUTion comes on and the failure is shown amber on the EWD page. NOTE: -The phases of the flight phase inhibition schematic are FWC phases, not Flight Management (FM) phases. -The status page is obtained by pressing CLeaR or STatuS keys of the ECAM control panel. It does not appear automatically after warning activation. FAC 1+2 FAULT LOW ENERGY WARNING The aircraft energy level is a function of current speed, acceleration rate and flight path angle. When it becomes lower than a threshold, under which the thrust shall be increased, an audio \"Speed-Speed-Speed\" message is triggered every five seconds. This aural warning indicates that, with the current thrust, it is not possible to recover a positive flight path angle through pitch control. Thrust must be then increased until warning disappearance or alpha floor is triggered. This warning is available between 100 ft and 2000 ft out of alpha floor conditions. WINDSHEAR DETECTION The FACs achieve the windshear detection function independently of the ON/OFF selection of the overhead panel FAC P/BSW. The FACs trigger a red warning whenever windshear conditions are encountered. The warning triggers: - an aural warning, WINDSHEAR, repeated three times, - a WINDSHEAR red message displayed in the center of both PFDs (15 seconds mini). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) In case of FAC 1 and FAC 2 fault, the MASTER CAUT comes on, the aural warning sounds, both FAC P/BSW FAULT lights come on amber and the \"SPD LIM\" red warning is displayed on the speed scale of the PFD. The failure is shown amber on the ECAM displays. The \"OFF THEN ON\" action performed on a FAC P/BSW resets the computer if the fault disappears. An action on the MASTER CAUT P/B cancels the MASTER CAUT light. If this fault occurs on ground with engines shut down, the reset is automatic when the fault disappears. FAC 1(2) FAULT In case of FAC 1 or FAC 2 fault, the master caution comes on; the aural waning sounds and the related FAC P/BSW FAULT light comes on amber. The failure is shown amber on the displays.

When the A/THR function is disengaged: - the thrust levers control the engines, - on the FCU, the A/THR P/BSW light is off, - the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) displays neither the A/THR engagement status nor the A/THR modes. THRUST LEVERS The thrust levers are manually operated and electrically connected to the Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADECs). NOTE: The thrust levers never move automatically. Each lever has 3 sectors defined by detents and stops. The thrust levers can be moved on a sector which includes specific positions: - rear sector: for idle reverse up to max reverse. - center section: 0: corresponds to an idle thrust, CL: corresponds to a climb thrust. - forward section: FLX/MCT: corresponds to a FLeXible take-off thrust or a Maximum Continuous Thrust after an engine failure, TOGA: corresponds to a maximum Takeoff/Go Around thrust. The FADECs compute the thrust limit, which depends on the position of the thrust levers. If both thrust levers are in the same detent, the thrust limit corresponds to this detent. If both levers are not in the same detent, the thrust limit corresponds to the next higher detent. The Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) select the highest thrust limits of the FADEC 1 and FADEC 2 for thrust target computation. A/THR FUNCTION LOGIC The A/THR function can be ENGAGED or DISENGAGED. When it is engaged, it can be ACTIVE or NOT ACTIVE. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd A/THR ENGAGED AND ACTIVE When the A/THR function is engaged, A/THR is active if: - at least, one thrust lever is between the CL detent (included) and the 0 stop (included), and, at the most, one thrust lever is between the FLX/MCT detent and the CL detent, and there is no engine in FLX TO mode, - or the alpha-floor protection is active independently of the thrust lever positions. NOTE: In case of one engine failure, the A/THR activation zone is between the FLX/MCT detent and the 0 stop, instead of the CL detent, and the 0 stop. Because the A/THR function is active: - the A/THR system controls the engines, - on the FCU, the A/THR P/BSW light is on, - the FMA displays the A/THR engagement status in white and the A/THR mode. A/THR ENGAGED AND NOT ACTIVE When the A/THR function is engaged, A/THR is not active if: At least one thrust lever is above the FLX/MCT detent, or both thrust levers are above the CL detent, or at least one engine is in FLX TO mode, with the alpha-floor protection not active. Because the A/THR function is not active: - the thrust levers control the engines as long as a thrust lever is outside the A/THR active area, Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 84 of 142 - the A/THR P/BSW light is on, - the FMA displays the A/THR engagement status in cyan and the MANual THRust rating in white, surrounded with an amber box.

The reference can be: - a speed or a mach number; in this case, the source is either the FCU for a value chosen by the pilot, or the FMGC itself, - a thrust; in that case, the sources are: The FADECs which compute the thrust limit when the A/THR is not active. The FMGC itself within the thrust limit always computed by the FADECs when the A/THR is active. The A/THR modes are SPEED/MACH, THR, RETARD, which can be overpassed by the alpha-floor protection. The A/THR function protects against an excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA). Each Flight Augmentation computer (FAC) detects the alpha-floor signal. In case of excessive AOA or avoidance maneuver, the FACs send an order to the FMGCs which activate the alpha-floor protection. The A/THR automatically engages or stays engaged active and the engine thrust becomes equal to the TOGA thrust for any thrust lever position. In this condition, the green message A. FLOOR with an amber flashing box is displayed on the FMA. When the alpha-floor detection is no longer present in the FACs, the green message TOGA LK (LK for Lock) with an amber flashing box is displayed on the FMA. The alpha-floor protection can only be cancelled through the disengagement of the A/THR function. MODES DESCRIPTION The choice of the mode is automatically made by the FMGCs according to the active AP or Flight Director (FD) vertical mode. This choice is based on a simple law: priority to the speed control. - when the AP controls the aircraft speed with the elevators, the A/THR has to control the engines by a fixed thrust demand (THR mode). - when the AP controls another aircraft parameter (e. g. altitude), the A/THR has to take care of the aircraft speed by a variable thrust demand to the engines (SPEED/MACH mode). - Beside these two modes, RETARD is only available in automatic landing when engine thrust has to be reduced to idle for the flare phase below 40 feet RA. A/THR OPERATION IN FLIGHT TAKE-OFF The aircraft is on ground and ready for take-off. Neither the AP nor the A/THR are engaged. The engines are controlled by the thrust levers. To take-off, the pilot sets the thrust levers to the TOGA stop or to the FLX/MCT detent if a flexible temperature is selected on a Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU). This engages the A/THR function but it remains not active. DEFAULT MODES THRUST REDUCTION ALTITUDE When no vertical mode is engaged, the A/THR operates only in SPEED/MACH modes except: - when THR mode engages automatically in case of alpha-floor protection activation, - when, A/THR being in RETARD mode, the AP disengaged, the A/THR function remains in RETARD mode. At the thrust reduction altitude, a message on the FMAs indicates to the pilot that he has to set the thrust levers into the CL detent. As soon as the thrust levers are in the CL detent, the A/THR is active. If a thrust lever is set into the CL-MCT or O-CL area, a message on the FMAs warns the pilot to set the thrust lever to the CL detent: - white LVR CLB message if it is in the CL-FLX/MCT area, - amber LVR ASYM message if it is in the O-CL area. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 88 of 142 The A/THR remains active. Then, the thrust levers remain in this position until the approach phase. When the A/C reach the thrust reduction altitude, LVR CLB appears and flashing. AUTOMATIC LANDING During automatic landing, before touch down, an auto call out, RETARD, indicates to the pilot that he has to set the thrust levers to the 0 stop. When he does it, the A/THR disengages. This lets the automatic activation of ground spoilers if they are in armed condition. Then, on ground, the pilot moves the thrust levers on the REVerse sector. DISCONNECTION Besides the normal A/THR operation, the A/THR function is disengaged either by a pilot action or in case of a system failure. The A/THR function can be disengaged either by pressing at least one of the two red instinctive disconnect P/Bs on the side of the thrust levers or by pressing the A/THR P/BSW on the FCU. A/THR disengagement can also be triggered due to an external system failure. When the A/THR function is active, the actual engine thrust does not necessarily correspond to the thrust lever position. DISCONNECTION CONSEQUENCES Consequently, it is important to know what happens after an A/THR disconnection: When the disconnection is made by the instinctive disconnect P/B, the thrust is immediately adjusted to the thrust lever position. In other cases, after FCU P/BSW disconnection, or failure: - when a thrust lever is in its detent, the thrust on the corresponding engine is frozen at its last value just before the disconnection (memo mode). - as soon as a thrust lever is moved out the detent, or if it is not in a detent, the thrust on the corresponding engine is smoothly adapted to the thrust lever position.

The master Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) imposes all the changes of AP/Flight Director (FD) modes and/or A/THR engagement to the slave FMGC. Here is an example of a master FMGC. Look at the flow chart to understand the priority logic. With no AP, no FD1 but FD2 engaged, FMGC2 is the master because, by following the flow chart, the first three answers are NO, but the fourth one is YES.

FMGC1 normally drives the FD symbols (crossbars or flight path director symbols) on the CAPT PFD. FMGC2 normally drives the FD symbols on the F/O PFD. The 1FD2 indication is displayed on each Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) to show that FD1 is engaged on CAPT side and FD2 is engaged on F/O side. If one FMGC fails, the remaining FMGC drives the FD symbols on both PFDs. If FMGC1 fails, the 2FD2 indication is displayed on each FMA to show that FD2 is displayed on both PFDs. If both FDs fail, a red flag is displayed on each PFD, provided that the corresponding FD switch is on.

There is no priority logic in single operation. The last engaged AP is the active one. Both APs can be engaged as soon as the APPROACH mode is selected on the Flight Control Unit (FCU). AP1 has priority, AP2 is in standby. The FCCs use the AP1 commands first. A switching is done to the AP2 commands in case of AP1 disengagement.

The A/THR function is, in fact, composed of two systems (A/THR1 and A/THR2), which are ready to be engaged at the same time, but only one system is selected. However, the selection of A/THR1 or A/THR2 depends on the engagement of the AP and FD. It is done according to the master/slave principle, which is known by the FCU and summarized in the table. When the selected A/THR function is active (according to the thrust lever position), the master FMGC controls the engines, via the FCU. Consequently, in automatic control, it is the same FMGC which controls the engines and the flight controls. To recover the A/THR function, when one AP is engaged and its own A/THR has failed, the opposite AP should be engaged to switch from the master FMGC to the other (which now becomes the master) and to switch to the opposite A/THR.

In general, the FCU provides the short term interface between the crew and the Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS). The FCU is the main interface to engage functions and guidance modes and to select parameters. NOTE: In fact, there is one FCU panel which controls two identical processing channels: FCU 1 and FCU 2. Only one channel is active at a time, the other is in standby. If both channels fail, all FCU controls are inoperative: A/THR, AP/Flight Director (FD) 1 and AP/FD 2 are not available. DISPLAY Here are listed some examples of function engagement, selection of required guidance modes and flight parameters. The FCU allows: - engagement of APs, FDs and A/THR, - selection of guidance modes; e.g. HeaDinG, Vertical Speed (V/S) or TRacK, Flight Path Angle (FPA), - selection and display of the various guidance targets whenever a manual selection is required (SPeeD - HDG - TRK - V/S - FPA - ALT).

At Flight Management (FM) initialization, that means at power up, both FM parts exchange information. Initial cross-comparison is made on the following parameters: Navigation database identification, performance database identification, FM operational program identification, aircraft program pin data and engine program pin data. NORMAL MODE If the FM parts agree, normal mode is active. When keys are pressed, they are immediately processed by both FMs, regardless of the Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU) from which they originate. INDEPENDENT MODE If the FM parts disagree, a white message FMS1/FMS2 A/C STS DIFF is displayed on the MCDUs and the system then reverts to independent mode. Each FM part manages its own MCDU. A failure in the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) inter system buses results in an amber MCDU message INDEPENDENT OPERATION. SINGLE MODE If one FM part has failed, a single mode is active. Both MCDUs are driven by the remaining FM part. A white message OPP FMGC IN PROGRESS is displayed on the MCDU corresponding to the failed FMGC. NORMAL MODE In normal mode, the FM part receives the master/slave activation from the Flight Guidance (FG) part. The master computer imposes the following parameters upon the slave computer: - flight phase, - flight plan sequencing, - active performance mode and speeds, - clearance and maximum altitudes, - ILS frequencies and courses, if any. After a flight plan change, there is a comparison on the active leg and, every second, on the active performance mode and active guidance mode. If it is different, the slave computer will synchronize itself to the master computer by copying the master values. Also, aircraft position, Gross Weight (GW) and target speeds from master and slave computers are compared every second. If the difference is greater than 5 Nm, 2 tons or 2 Kts respectively, an appropriate message is displayed on the MCDUs: - FMS1/FMS2 POS DIFF, - FMS1/FMS2 GW DIFF, - FMS1/FMS2 SPD TGT DIFF. Pilot action is then required. independent mode In independent mode, there is no interaction from one system to the other one. The FMGCs only send their status information to each other (e.g., in this case, the independent mode). SINGLE MODE In single mode, both MCDUs are driven by the same FM part, but they can still display different pages. Messages linked to the navigation process are displayed on both MCDUs.

In normal mode, the MCDUs can be used simultaneously on different pages. Any modification or entry on one MCDU is sent to the other MCDU via the FMGC cross talk. In independent mode, both MCDUs operate separately. Although the cross talk is present, an entry on one MCDU is not applied to the other one. In single mode, both MCDUs basically work as in normal mode, but with the valid FMGC only. displays FM information is displayed on NDs and on PFDs. For FM information, in normal or independent modes, FMGC1 supplies PFD1 and ND1, FMGC2 supplies PFD2 and ND2. In single mode, the remaining FMGC supplies all the displays. radio navigation The schematic shows the architecture of the radio navigation receivers controlled by the FMGCs in normal or independent modes. For the selection of radio navigation frequencies and courses, in normal or independent modes, each FMGC controls its own side receivers through a Radio Management Panel (RMP). Only the actual frequencies and courses from the receivers are displayed on the PFDs and the NDs. In case of an FMGC failure, the valid FMGC controls its own side receivers as usual, through an RMP, but also the other side receivers, directly without going through a RMP. If both FMGCs fail, the crew must use the RMPs to select the frequencies and courses.

The elements are mainly taken from the database or directly entered by the pilot. The limitations are mainly speed, altitude or time constraints originated by the ATC. The function that integrates these elements and limitations to construct a flight plan is called flight planning. In addition to this, the Flight Management (FM) part gives the aircraft position and the follow-up of the flight plan, this is called navigation. Everything can be prepared prior to the take-off but can also be modified quickly and easily during the flight operation. In case of an FM problem, the remaining valid Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) is used as sole source to command both Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDUs) and NDs after automatic switching. NAVIGATION DATABASE The navigation database gives all necessary information for flight plan construction and follow-up. The pilot will either select an already assembled flight plan called COmpany ROUTE, or will build his own flight plan, using the existing database contents. This database has a tailored coverage, updated every 28 days. Some room is kept to allow manual entry of 20 NAVigation AIDS, 20 waypoints, 10 runways and 3 company routes. NOTE: Optionally, aircraft are equipped with the second generation of Flight Management System (FMS2). The room kept allows manual entry of 20 NAVAIDS, 20 waypoints, 10 runways and 5 company routes. The database cannot be erased. However and as an option, the manually entered data can be erased when the flight phase is over (i.e. aircraft on ground for 30 seconds). Two cycle database can be loaded and the selection is made automatically by using data from the aircraft clock or Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) manually. The database loading into either FMGC is done with the help of a Portable Data Loader (PDL) or via the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU) if installed. Then, the cross loading function allows database loading into the other FMGC through crosstalk busses. NAVIGATION The navigation process gives the system with current aircraft state information consisting of present position, altitude, winds, true airspeed and ground speed. This is achieved using inputs from the Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), air data sensors, GPS, navigation radios, Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) and Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) flight envelope computation. Position can be updated manually during the flight or automatically, on the runway threshold at take-off for example. ACARS FUNCTION The FMS uses the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) function to exchange data between the ground station and the master FMGC via the ATSU. This interface makes the exchange of flight plan initialization, take-off, wind, and broadcast data and flight reports with the ground. Via the ACARS, the crew may send a request for wind data to the ground. In response to this request, or automatically, the ground sends climb, cruise, descent and alternate wind data to the aircraft. LATERAL FLIGHT PLAN The lateral flight plan gives the sequential track changes at each waypoint within 3 main sections. - DEPARTURE: initial fix (origin airport), Standard Instrument Departure (SID)... - EN ROUTE: waypoints, NAVAIDS... CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 118 of 142 - ARRIVAL: Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR), approach, missed approach, go around... The lateral steering order can be followed by the pilot or the AP with the NAV mode selected. profiles. Fuel and time are the main actors in this particular part of the FM function and direct the airline choice. VERTICAL FLIGHT PLAN According to the pilot selection on the EFIS control panel of the FCU, the flight plan is shown in relation to the aircraft position on the ROSE-NAV or ARC modes. The aircraft model is fixed and the chart moves. The difference between the two modes is that the half range is available when the ND is set to ROSE-NAV mode, as there is only frontal view when it is set to ARC mode. In PLAN mode, the flight plan is shown, with NORTH at the top of the screen, centered on the TO waypoint. Depending on the selected range, the aircraft may or may not be visualized on this display. The plan display can be de-centered by scrolling the flight plan on the MCDU. The PFD shows the FM guidance following engagement of the AP/Flight Director (FD) lateral and longitudinal modes. The vertical flight plan gives an accurate flight path prediction, which requires a precise knowledge of current and forecast wind, temperature and the lateral flight path to be flown. The vertical flight plan is divided into several flight phases: - PREFLIGHT: fuel, weight and V2 insertions, - TAKE-OFF: speed management, thrust reduction altitude, acceleration altitude, - CLIMB: speed limit, speed management, - CRUISE: top of climb, cruise altitude, top of descent, - DESCENT: speed limit, speed management, deceleration, - APPROACH/MISSED APPROACH/GO AROUND: thrust reduction altitude, acceleration altitude. The vertical steering order can be followed by the pilot or the AP. Any level change in the vertical profile is initiated after a pull or push action on the altitude selector knob on the Flight Control Unit (FCU), except for departure when the vertical profile is armed on ground and will automatically be active after take-off phase. DISPLAY PERFORMANCE The performance database contains optimal speed schedules for the expected range of operating conditions. Several performance modes are available to the operator with the primary one being the ECONomic mode. The ECON mode can be tailored to meet specific airline requirements using a selectable Cost Index (CI). A CI is defined as the ratio of cost of time to the cost of fuel. The Fuel Quantity and Indication Computers (FQICs) give the fuel quantity. The speed and the thrust values associated with a given CI are used to determine the climb and descent Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 119 of 142 PERFORMANCE DATABASE OPTIMISATION (DPO) The DPO updates the Performance Database of the aircraft Flight Management System (FMS) to enable consistently more efficient descents by allowing the aircraft to remain in the cruise phase longer and removing the 'level-off' stage at the bottom of the descent, which reduces carbon emissions. In addition, the Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) works in tandem with DPO to reduce noise. The DPO function enables aircraft to use an optimum engine model to compute the profile of the descent, requesting less fuel when the engine is using idle thrust. In addition, it maximises the time spent at efficient cruise level by setting the top of descent later in the profile. Essentially what this means is that the aircraft stays at the higher cruise altitude and effectively descends under its own natural weight rather than flying a forced descent which is less fuel efficient BASIC FUNCTIONS Fuel Savings DPO reduces fuel consumption, resulting in proportional C02 and NOx reductions. Relaxing Idle Margin The level of Idle considered to compute the descent profile is reduced resulting in a less conservative slope Update engine performance model Using a more accurate engine model allows to compute a more realistic descent profile. The differences between managed and open descent are highly reduced. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) Airbus describe the new software as its \"Descent Profile Optimisation\" (DPO) function and this can be added to the FMC function software of all legacy A320 ceo aircraft worldwide The enhancement to the aircraft's on-board Flight Management System (FMS) performance database offers the ability to generate fuel savings and reduce CO2 emissions. Optimisation of an aircraft's flight trajectory is one of the key factors to further improve efficiency in cooperation with Air Traffic Control. The DPO function allows aircraft to descend from cruise altitude using only idle engine thrust, which reduces fuel consumption, resulting in proportional CO2 and NOx (nitrogen oxide emissions) reductions. To further enhance fuel reduction, DPO maximises the time spent at efficient cruise level -- by not starting the descent too early and subsequently minimising the amount of time spent at an inefficient 'leveloff' stage at the bottom of the descent -- when the aircraft's engines generate thrust to maintain level flight in dense air prior to final landing approach. When installed on the A320ceo aircraft, the DPO solution will help Airlines achieve fuel savings per aircraft, per year, enabling even more efficient operations particularly at constrained airports. In addition, DPO will help us reduce CO2 emissions by many tons per aircraft, per year, allowing Airlines to contribute towards more sustainable flight operations. DPO is one of the several flight operations optimisation solutions offered by Airbus and can be complemented by IDLE Factor Optimiser (IFO), a cloud based solution service offered by flight operations services subsidiary Navblue, to optimise aircraft performance. Together with improved Air Traffic Management, these fuel savings solutions enable operators in their decarbonisation journey.

In case of Go-around, this enhancement enables the flight crew: - To keep the NAV mode engaged, or - To automatically arm the NAV mode that avoids pilot action on the HDG/TRK selector knob. This function may be activated via pin programming (Mod. 25612, 38399, 38670): Speed overshoot/undershoot prevention Speed overshoot or undershoot may occur when Automatic Flight System (AFS) experiences a perturbation (wind gradient, engine failure, etc). Activation of the Speed protection package (AP/FD speed protection, AP/FD engagement /disengagement conditions) is performed via pin programming. This function requires at least the FMGC FMS 2 (mandated by EASA AD 2016-0122 & FAA AD 2017-20-10) and FCU standard M11.

DISPLAY Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 128 of 142 This Page Intentionally Left Blank Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 129 of 142 NAVIGATION BACK-UP D/O (OPTION) (3) GENERAL The MCDU BACK-UP NAV (B/UP NAV) must be used as a back-up system when both Flight Management (FM) parts have failed.The MCDU BACK-UP NAV (B/UP NAV) gives to the crew limited information, which can be used to complete the current flight. The MCDU B/UP NAV is activated through the \"SELECT NAV B/UP\" prompt on the MCDU MENU page. The B/UP NAV functions work independently and may be activated separately. FLIGHT PLANNING Before activation of the BACK-UP NAV function, a condensed form of the flight plan is transferred from the FM part to the MCDU. This downloading is updated in case of: - FM primary Flight Plan (F-PLN) changes, - FM lateral leg sequencing, - FM long power off, - FM source selector change, - FM resynchronization. Downloading includes waypoint position, waypoint identifier, leg type, discontinuity, overfly and turn direction information in a maximum of 150 legs. At BACK-UP NAV activation, a last updating is done and then any other updating is ignored. A reduced capability is given to the MCDU B/UP NAV function compared to the FM function. NAVIGATION The BACK-UP NAV function is based on Inertial Reference (IR) inputs from the ownside IR or IR3, which gives the position, ground speed, track, heading, altitude and wind. The selected IR depends on pilot selection, through the IR source selector, to be consistent with the current Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) displayed IR data on the related PFD and ND. The MCDU B/UP NAV gives, the crosstrack error and the bearing/distance/time to go to the active waypoint, depending on the aircraft latitude/longitude and on the active leg of the flight plan. It supplies the automatic leg change when the TO waypoint is reached. It is very important to note that all this data is only for display, there is no steering order issued by the MCDU, and the NAV mode cannot be engaged. ND DISPLAY The MCDU transmits the BACK-UP F-PLN to the NDs. It has active F-PLN vectors and waypoints related to the fixed aircraft position in ROSE or ARC modes, or to the moving aircraft reference in PLAN mode. In all cases, the flight plan line is dashed in green (as NAV mode cannot be engaged). Options selectable on the EFIS control panel are not allowed (AiRPorT, Non-Directional Beacon, VOR.D, WayPoinT, ConSTRaint). MCDU PAGE AVAILABILITY All flight-planning operations are directly applied through the B/UP F-PLN page. It displays each leg of the active route, giving position information for each waypoint, as well as computed course, time and distance for the connecting legs. The revisions, available on the B/UP F-PLN page, are: - waypoint insertion, - waypoint deletion, - discontinuity deletion, - overfly deletion/insertion. Pressing the DIR key enables the selection of a waypoint to join it directly. The B/UP F-PLN/DIR TO page is similar to the F-PLN page but line 1 is reserved for waypoint entry. Pressing the PROGress key gives navigation information. The B/UP PROG page displays the aircraft position with identification of the selected CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 130 of 142 IR. It also gives ground speed, and active leg track with aircraft track. The top line displays the waypoint identifier and altitude at the last sequenced waypoint, also called overhead (OVHD). The bottom line enables access to the B/UP IRS pages. The B/UP IRS pages correspond to IR1 or 2, function of MCDU1 or 2, and IR3. IR provides, for display information about position, the true track, the true and magnetic headings, the ground speed and the wind. DEACTIVATION Backup Navigation is deactivated upon one of the following events: - The Deselect NAV B/UP prompt is pushed on the MCDU MENU page - The following condition becomes true: onside FM is Healtly and offside FM is failed - The FM subsystem is selected via its menu text prompt on the MENU page. When Backup navigation is not available, no Select NAV B/UP nor Deselect NAV B/UP prompt is displayed. The field is blank. Upon Backup Nav deactivation, the Backup Nav functions are disabled and the FM is given back control of the Nav Display.

DEACTIVATION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 132 of 142 AUTO FLIGHT SYSTEM OPERATION, CONTROL & INDICATING (3) FMGC FAILURE Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 133 of 142 FMGS WARNINGS (3) GENERAL NOTE: All warnings in this lesson are generated by Flight Warning Computer (FWC) logics, except for some cases, which are indicated. BOTH FD'S FAILURE NOTE: - the phases of the flight phase inhibition schematic are FWC phases not Flight Management (FM) phases, - the status page is obtained by pressing CLeaR or STatuS keys of the ECAM control panel. It does not appear automatically after warning activation. In case of non-engagement or disengagement of both Flight Directors (FDs) not due to an action on the FD P/BSWs, a red FD flag appears on both PFDs. The FD failure can be internal or due to peripherals. This warning is not generated by the FWC but by a Display Management Computer (DMC) logic. The red FD flag on a given PFD is inhibited when the corresponding FD P/BSW, located on the EFIS control panel of the Flight Control Unit (FCU), is off. AP OFF The AP loss warning is divided into two cases. First, when the AP loss is due to an action on a take over P/BSW. The second case is when the AP loss is due to another reason than an action on a take over P/BSW. ACTION ON TAKE OVER PUSHBUTTON The visual and associated audio warnings are temporary: - the red MASTER WARNing light flashes for 3 s, - the red AP OFF message is displayed for 9 s, - the cavalry charge aural warning sounds for 1.5 s. Pressing the MASTER WARN P/BSW or a second action on the take over P/BSW immediately cancels the MASTER WARN flashing and the red AP OFF message; the cavalry charge is cancelled only after 0.5 s. An AP re-engagement cancels everything at once. OTHER REASON If the two APs are engaged and just one is lost, the warning is not triggered. An action on the MASTER WARN P/BSW or on the take over P/B cancels the MASTER WARN flashing and the red AUTO FLT AP OFF message; the cavalry charge is cancelled only after 1.5 s. A successful re-engagement of the AP cancels everything at once. Either AP1+2 or AP1 or AP2 is displayed on the status page. FCU 1+2 FAULT In case of FCU 1 and FCU 2 fault, the MASTER CAUTion comes on; the aural warning sounds and the failure is shown amber on the displays. NOTE: The STATUS messages are never inhibited. FCU 1(2) FAULT In case of FCU 1 or FCU 2 fault, the related amber indication appears on the displays. NOTE: The STATUS messages are never inhibited. A/THR OFF The A/THR loss warning is divided into two cases. First, when the loss is due to an action on an instinctive disconnect P/BSW or to a thrust levers setting on idle performed above 50 ft. The second case is when the loss of the A/THR function is due to any other reason. PILOT ACTION The warnings are temporary: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue: 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 Page 134 of 142 - the amber MASTER CAUT light goes off after 3 s, - the amber A/THR OFF message disappears after 9 s. The MASTER CAUT light and the amber A/THR OFF message are cancelled by an action on the MASTER CAUT P/BSW or on an instinctive disconnect P/BSW or by an A/THR re-engagement. NOTE: The amber message: A/THR OFF displayed on the EWD is not inhibited by any flight phase. OTHER REASON The MASTER CAUT light and the amber AUTO FLT A/THR OFF message are cancelled by an action on the MASTER CAUT P/BSW or on an instinctive disconnect P/B or by an A/THR re-engagement. NOTE: This warning is not triggered when the thrust levers are set on idle below 50 ft. As the A/THR is OFF and the engine thrust is locked, the thrust levers have to be moved. If the thrust levers are not moved within 5 seconds, an additional repetitive warning is triggered every 5 seconds. A/THR LIMITED When the A/THR is active and the thrust levers are below the CLimb detent, the MASTER CAUT comes on and a repetitive warning is triggered every 5 seconds until the levers are put back in this detent. In case of one engine out, the same principle applies except that the Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) detent replaces the CL detent. AUTOLAND The AUTOLAND red warning tells the pilot that, depending on the procedures, he has to do a go-around or a manual landing. This warning can only be activated in LANDing mode with at least one AP engaged. The AUTOLAND red warning is triggered in the following cases: - both APs OFF below 200 ft RA, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 / V2500) - When following ILS beams, in case of a LOCalizer excessive deviation (1/4 dot above 15 ft RA) or GLIDE excessive deviation (1 dot above 100 ft RA). LOC and GLIDE scales flash on the PFD, - loss of LOC signal above 15 ft or loss of GLIDE signal above 100 ft. The FD bars flash on the PFD. The LAND mode remains engaged. A triple click aural warning is generated in the event of landing capacity downgrading. The warning is cancelled by LOC mode or AP disengagement or by doing a go-around. NOTE: A warning test can be done by pressing the captain or the first officer AUTOLAND P/BSW. CAPACITY CHANGE The warning corresponding to a landing capacity downgrading is an aural warning and messages on the status page. This flight phase inhibition just concerns the triple click aural warning. It is triggered when there is a downgrading of landing capacity or when the LAND mode is disarmed or disengaged. Messages on the status page can always be displayed except when the system is in LAND mode (armed or active) and except in phase 1 or 10. NOTE: In LAND mode, the landing category is displayed on the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) of the PFD. ALTITUDE ALERT The altitude alert takes into account the difference between the aircraft altitude and the reference altitude selected on the FCU. It has an effect on the altitude window of the PFD and can trigger the C-chord aural warning. The altitude alert is inhibited by Glide Slope (G/S) capture and canceled by turning the FCU altitude knob, or by setting the landing gear lever to DOWN with slats extended or when the landing gear is downlocked.

The radio communication systems are used for communications to and from the aircraft. The radio communication system is used for the communication of the crew with ground stations and with other aircraft through VHF Data Radio (VDR), High Frequency Data Radio (HFDR) and SATCOM if installed. The VHF transceivers are the same and interchangeable. The HF transceivers are also the same and interchangeable. VDR 1 and VDR 2 are usually used by the flight crew for voice communications. VDR 3 is used for Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) functions and as back-up voice communications if there is a failure of system 1 or 2. The HF transceivers are used when the aircraft is not in the applicable range of the VHF radios.

Three dialog buses are used for the exchange of information between the three RMPs. Each RMP periodically transmits its context on its dialog bus. Each RMP can control any radio XCVR but is more particularly dedicated to one system. Basic allocation: - RMP 1 VHF 1, - RMP 2 VHF 2. Possible allocation (depending on options): - RMP 3 HF 1, HF 2 and VHF 3. In normal operation, the navigation systems are tuned automatically or manually from the MCDUs by the FMGCs via internal relays of the onside RMPs. The RMP is thus transparent to the onside FMGC. In case of failure of one FMGC, the onside navigation systems are tuned directly by the remaining FMGC. The BITE functions of the system are available through the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). LGCIU In order to increment the fault memories in case of Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) failure, each RMP receives a discrete giving the landing gear configuration. RMP 1 receives this discrete from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1, and RMP 2 and 3 from LGCIU 2. NOTE: Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) uses VHF 3 for data transmission. NAVIGATION If the standby navigation mode is selected, the navigation systems frequencies are controlled by RMP 1 and RMP 2 only. The standby navigation is selected in the event of failure of both Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs). In this condition: - RMP 1 controls VOR 1, Automatic Direction Finder 1 (ADF) and Instrument Landing System 1 (ILS) and 2, - RMP 2 controls VOR 2, ADF 2 and ILS 1 and 2. For ILS functions, Multi-Mode Receivers (MMRs) 1 and 2 always operate on the same frequency which can be controlled from any RMP, either directly or through the cross talk bus. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CFDIU RMP FAILURE The system architecture gives access to all communication functions in case of failure of any RMP. A RMP failure is indicated by the blanking of the display windows. If a failure occurs, the failed RMP has to be switched off. When selected off, the RMP sends a discrete signal for system reconfiguration. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 17 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY RADIO ...

Aero-H+-HSD SATCOM lets the aircraft fly in the spot beam coverage to transmit and receive multichannel voice, fax, e-mail and circuit mode data services. Packet mode data services and emergency calls are available world-wide in the global beam. The system Aero-H+-HSD SATCOM includes: - a Satellite Data Unit (SDU), - a High Speed Data Unit (HSDU), a second HSDU is optional, - a splitter, - an attenuator, - a High Gain Antenna (HGA). The SDU is the interface to other aircraft systems. It contains all data processing functions. It also contains the modems, channel tuning synthesizers, high-stability reference oscillator, to/from intermediate frequency to/from L-band conversion and the High Power Amplifier (HPA) used to amplify the SDU-generated L-band signal to a power level necessary for correct transmission to the satellite. SDU The SDU is the primary system of the SATCOM system. It does most of the data-handling, protocol, modulation/coding and demodulation/decoding functions of the Aircraft Earth Station (AES). The SDU is connected to: - the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) to send the relative azimuth and relative elevation command to the Beam Steering Unit (BSU) to point the steerable beam of the HGA for best reception and transmission, - the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) for BITE, - the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) when the VHF link with ground station is not possible, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD - the Cabin Telecommunication Unit (CTU) for the cabin/passenger telecommunications equipment to get the best performance from the resources supplied by the SATCOM, - the MCDUs to display call status information and system configuration information for the SDU, - the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU) installed on the pedestal and used to up/download software, - the Flight Warning Computer (FWC), to send warnings and cautions during the flight, - the Audio Management Unit (AMU) to make audio transmission (the calls are started with the related SATCOM channel SAT 1 or SAT 2 transmission key on the Audio Control Panel (ACP)), - the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) to transmit air/ground information discrete outputs. The RF signal is sent to the HPA through an attenuator and it is received from the Diplexer/Low Noise Amplifier (D/LNA). HSDU The HSDU supplies one channel at a maximum data rate of 64 kb/s. The HSDU gives two communication services (also known as Swift64): - the Mobile-Integrated Services Digital Network (M-ISDN) for communications charged by minutes of connection, - the Mobile Packet Data Services (MPDS) for communications charged by the number of bits transmitted. HGA The high gain antenna is an electronically steerable phased array. Simultaneous transmission and reception of satellite signals (full duplex operation) supplies two bands of operation: receive (Rx) band and transmit (Tx) band. Beam steering of the antenna is done via serial transmission of phase shifter data from the D/LNA unit. Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 42 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY The HGA supplies +12 dBic nominal gain with near hemispherical coverage and can be used for the transmission of high-rate data and voice communications.

The satellite system transmits the 406 MHz distress signal to a Local User Terminal (LUT), when the LUT is in range. The LUT receiving range is a radius of approximately 2.500 km (1367.00 NM). When the LUT is not in receiving range, the satellite system stores the distress signal until transmission is possible. The LUT automatically processes the distress signal to identify and show the position of the aircraft to a radius of approximately 1.8 km (5900 ft). The processed data is transmitted to a Mission Control Center (MCC). The MCC sends the data to an applicable Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), where Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are started. The 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz signals are used to find the aircraft in the final stage of SAR operation. ELT DESCRIPTION The ELT system includes these components: - An ELT, - An Aircraft Identification Module (AIM), - A Remote Control Panel (RCP), - An antenna, installed on the upper external fuselage between FRame 64 and FR65, - An indicator, - A horn. - An electronic unit, - A battery pack, - An interface, - A connector. The electronic unit and the battery-pack are kept in the housing. The electronic unit has two different G-switches installed (North American and European). The battery-pack is made of five lithium batteries connected together. You can get access to the battery-pack through a cover on the attachment side of the ELT. The cover is installed with screws. The interface includes: - An ARM/OFF/TX switch, - An antenna connector, - An RCP connector, - An indicator. The connector is installed on the back end of the ELT (against flight direction), and connects directly to the AIM. The RCP connector is used to connect an RCP, or a Beacon Message Programmer (BMP). The ELT is programmable to one of the five approved protocols: - Serialized Aviation User Protocol, - Aviation User Protocol, - 24 bit Aircraft Address Number, - Aircraft Operator Designator Number and Serial Number, - Serial Number Protocol. AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION MODULE The AIM is installed on the same support bracket as the ELT, and is held in position with bolts, washers and nuts. It is connected directly to the ELT connector and has a connector on the rear side for connection to a BMP. EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER REMOTE CONTROL PANEL The ELT is installed with bolts, washers and nuts on a support bracket, and the interface points in flight direction.

The RCP can: - Manually start ELT operation (if the ELT ARM/OFF/TX switch is set to the ARMED position), - Reset ELT operation to the ARMED mode (this is not applicable when the ELT ARM/OFF/TX switch is set to the TX position), - Start and monitor a BITE test. The ON-ARMED-TEST/RESET switch has these functions: - Set to the ON position for manual operation of the ELT. You must lift the switch guard to set the switch to the ON position, - Set to the ARMED position for automatic operation of the ELT. The switch is kept in the ARMED position by a switch guard. The switch guard stops accidental operation of the ELT, - Set to the TEST/RESET position to start an ELT BITE test, or to reset ELT operation to the ARMED mode. Set the switch to the TEST/RESET position for not longer than 2 seconds to start a BITE test. The ON indicator comes on when the ELT operates, or to give the BITE test result. During ELT transmission the indicator slowly flashes continuously. EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER The ELT operates automatically or manually. The battery-pack supplies the power to operate the ELT. The signal transmission can continue for approximately fifty hours. The three-position switch controls three modes: - OFF mode: there is no power available from the battery-pack and the ELT circuits are not energized. The ELT cannot detect a crash or transmit rescue signals. You cannot operate a BITE test in this mode, - ARMED mode: the necessary circuits are energized and the ELT can detect a start signal from the G-switch, the RCP or the ELT ARM/OFF/TX switch. After the signal is received, the ELT switches to transmit mode. You can operate a BITE test in this mode. There are 3 different types of operation in the armed mode: - Automatic operation occurs when the G-switch detects an impact sufficient to start the transmit mode, - Manual operation occurs when you need to transmit a signal (aircraft out of operation, injured passengers/crew members), or when you do a BITE test, - Accidental operation occurs when the ELT is connected to its system in the A/C and the G-switch starts transmission without a real emergency (hard landing). - Transmit mode: the ELT starts to transmit 121.5/243 MHz and 406 MHz signals to the antenna. AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION MODULE The AIM automatically programs the 406 MHz message in the ELT with one of the different message protocols. During an ELT BITE test the AIM transmits this aircraft identification code to the ELT. After the data transfer occurs the AIM verifies that the data was transmitted correctly. You can also program the AIM with a NULL message that will not reprogram the ELT. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) BITE TEST This BITE test can be done with the RCP or the ELT. On the RCP: - Set the ON-ARMED-TEST/RESET switch to the TEST/RESET position for not longer than two seconds, then back to the ARMED position, - The indicator flashes two times, - An emergency signal can be heard on the 121.5 MHz frequency, at the cockpit loudspeaker.

In normal operation, DIR 1 is active and DIR 2 is in hot stand-by. DIR 2 receives and computes the same data as DIR 1 but its outputs are disabled when director1 is available. The director commands cabin equipment via Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs). The cargo smoke system is linked by Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. The Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) is linked by ethernet buses. Each DIR is separated in two parts: - the DIR main functions with the integrated Vacuum System Control (VSC) function, - the smoke detection board. Both parts work independently with segregated hardware and software. System reconfiguration for the installation of options, cabin reconfiguration or Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) expansion is limited to software database changes. These databases are the On Board Replaceable Module (OBRM) and Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The CIDS is also designed to detect internal and external faults. The CIDS is a Type 1 system. The DIRs are connected by ARINC data buses to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) for maintenance purposes. In the normal mode, the SerViCE BUS supplies the FAP (with the optional power supply with CIDS A318 type, the FAP is supplied by the HOT BAT BUS), all DIRs, and all DEUs with 28V DC. The system operates at full capacity. In the emergency mode, only the ESSential BUS supplies 28V DC to the CIDS. The type A DEUs, which are connected to the top lines, are then only supplied with power when a Passenger Address (PA) signal is present. If there is no PA signal, the DIR operates the top line cut-off relays to stop the power supply to the DEUs. The DIR is a central control and interface component of the CIDS. The current cabin layout and properties of layout related equipment are stored in the DIRs. The DIR provides the following functions: - the transmission of digitized audio signals, - the transmission of control data and commands, - the adaptation of received DEU data, - the control of other CIDS functional units, - the control of the FAP, - the data transfer to the Passenger Entertainment System (PES), - the service interphone system, - the control of the Additional Attendant Panel (AAP) via type B DEUs, - the interface to cockpit and avionics compartment, - the handling of cabin systems related inputs and outputs, - the control and interface of other systems, - the realization of programming functions, - the realization of test functions, - the activation of emergency mode with minimum power consumption.

One twisted pair of cable on each cabin side connects all type A DEUs installed on the same side. One top line data bus on each side of the passenger cabin connect the type A DEUs to the directors. Top lines are bi-directional serial high-speed data buses. FUNCTIONS NOTE: Note: The last connection box on the top line includes a bus termination resistor for impedance matching. The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) uses each type A DEU to control cabin lighting, signs and cabin loudspeakers according to cabin parameters programmed in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The passenger functions are centralized in the Passenger Service Unit (PSU). The Passenger Interface and Supply Adapter (PISA) is the PSU interface with the DEU A. A PISA is integrated into each PSU. Each DEU can control up to 6 PISAs or stand alone PISAs. One PISA interfaces with: - reading light switches and Light Emitting Diode (LED) reading lights, - passenger call buttons and call lights/seat row numbering lights, - loudspeakers, - No Smoking (NS) and Fasten Seat Belt (FSB) signs. One stand alone PISA interfaces with: - loudspeaker, - NS, FSB signs - Attendant work lights. Each type A DEU interfaces with: - PISAs and STA PISAs, - loudspeakers, - fluorescents strips and ballasts units, - NS and FSB signs. CONNECTION BOX Each connection box is connected to a DEU. It gives the DEU its own address by the two coding switches. This method enables replacement of DEUs without selecting their address. CIDS POWER-UP When the CIDS is powered-up or reset, the DIR follows a power-up routine. This includes the initialization and testing of each DEU and connected equipment. The test results are transmitted to the DIR which compares them with its programmed data to decide on their status. At least 95 % of possible DEU failures are automatically detected. FAIL SAFE OPERATION A broken wire in one top-line bus will only affect the type A DEUs behind the crack on this bus. The sound level of the operable top line is increased to make sure that the Passenger Address (PA) distribution is fulfilled for the other (not operable) top line side. An open circuit disables all DEUs after the break in the line. EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS All DEUs operate in emergency mode when the DC SerViCE bus is no longer powered. The DEUs are then supplied from the DC ESSential Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 85 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY bus.

One twisted pair of cable on each cabin side, above the ceiling, connects all type B DEUs installed on the same side. FUNCTIONS Up to 8 type B DEUs can be installed in the cabin. The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) uses each type B DEU to control the different devices needed by the cabin crew and the aircraft systems. The Attendant Indication Panels (AIPs), located in the cabin crew stations, indicate (in written form) Passenger Address (PA), INTerPHone (INTPH) and other system information to the cabin crew. The Additional Attendant Panel (AAP), located in the aft cabin, to remote control of light, evac and reset. The switch panel located adjacent to the middle RH and exit RH attendant station, gives indication of the EVAC alert, on reset of acoustic and visual EVAC alert indications related to the respective attendant station, or reset of all acoustic and visual lavatory smoke warnings. The Area Call Panels (ACPs) located on the ceiling near the cabin crew stations, draw the cabin crew attention by colored lights. Each cabin crew station has a handset for passenger address and interphone functions. The following equipments are connected to type B DEUs: - drain mast control unit, - Emergency Power Supply Units (EPSUs), - slide and door sensors, - call lights, - lavatory smoke detectors, - waste service panel, - potable water service panel, - flush control unit, - Liquid Level Sensor (LLS), Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) - Liquid Level Transmitter (LLT), - potable water quantity transmitter, - vacuum generator overheat signal. MIDDLE LINE DATA BUS One middle line data bus on each side of the passenger cabin connects the type B DEUs to the DIRs. Note that the last connection box on the middle line includes a bus termination resistor for impedance matching. Middle lines are bi-directional serial high-speed data buses. CONNECTION BOX Each connection box is connected to a DEU. It gives the DEU its own address by the two coding switches. This method enables replacement of DEUs without selecting their address. CIDS POWER-UP When the CIDS is powered-up or reset, the DIR follows a power-up routine. This includes the initialization and testing of each DEU and connected equipment. The test results are transmitted to the DIR which compares them with its programmed data to decide on their status. At least 95 % of possible DEU failures are automatically detected. FAIL SAFE OPERATION A failure of one middle line disables all cabin crew functions in the middle line side. EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS All DEUs operate in emergency mode when the DC SerViCE bus is no longer powered. The DEUs are then supplied from the DC ESSential bus. The type A DEU PA circuits and type B DEU INTPH circuits remain operational. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 88 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL ...

The active DIR assigns priorities to each source. It transmits the signal in digital form via the two top-line data buses to the type A Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs) and, optionally via the Passenger Entertainment System Main Multiplexer (PESMMUX), to each Passenger Control Unit (PCU). The type A DEUs send the signal to the cabin loudspeakers for broadcasting. The announcements can be heard, at each passenger seat, with a headset. The basic levels of priority are the following ones: - 1st priority: Flight compartment, - 2nd priority: Cabin attendant stations, - 3rd priority: Prerecorded announcement, - 4th priority: BGM and/or entertainment system (if installed). As an option the FWD attendant station could have the 2nd level of priority, in this case the other attendant stations will have the 3rd level of priority. The levels of priority and the defined options are programmed in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM) flash card integrated into the FAP. SOURCES A PA announcement can be manually initiated from the cockpit and from the cabin. The announcement from the cockpit can be initiated with: - the cockpit handset, - other equipment: handmic, boomset mic, oxygen-mask mic in conjunction with the Audio Control Panels (ACPs), - the No Smoking (NS) (or optionally EXIT) and Fasten Seat Belts (FSB) switches set to ON. The announcement from the cabin can be initiated with: - the attendant handsets, - the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP); from which the prerecorded announcements, stored in the PRerecorded Announcement and Music (PRAM) flash card (optional) integrated into the FAP, can be selected and initiated, as the BoardinG Music (BGM). Instead of the flash card, PRAM-audio cassette/compact disc reproducer can be optionally installed. - the Video Control Unit (VCU) if a video system is installed (optional). A PA announcement can be automatically initiated from the PRAM when: - the NS (or optionally EXIT) or FSB cockpit switches are set to AUTO and the landing gear is down and locked or slats and flaps are activated, - a cabin decompression occurs. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) PA LEVEL The CIDS transmits the PA announcements and the BGM to all passenger related loudspeakers. When an engine is running, the PA volume is increased automatically by + 6 dB, and by + 4 dB in the event of cabin depressurization, monitored by the Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC). The PA volume is also increased in case of a data bus failure (top line). If during a PA announcement the cockpit door is opened, there is a volume decrease of the PA announcement in the cockpit door area, to avoid a feedback with the cockpit. The CIDS gives the possibility to change the volume of chimes and announcements in all defined cabin areas independently. To change the settings in one area, the LEVEL ADJUSTMENT page must be selected on the FAP. The related Adjust button must be pushed on the LEVEL ADJUSTMENT page to open the related VOLUME ADJUSTMENT subpanel. To select the respective location the up/down buttons must be pushed on the VOLUME ADJUSTMENT subpanel. The volume of announcements and chimes is increased/decreased by pushing the related plus/minus button on the subpanel.

A communication is always initiated by a dial procedure with the attendant handset or by pushbuttons on the CALLS panel in the cockpit. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) director (DIR) accepts audio signals from the various interphone sources in the aircraft and assigns priorities to each source. The DIR does telephone exchange switching and call functions from cockpit call switch settings or the attendant handset keypad entries. All this is done with reference to the parameters defined in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). Chimes are transmitted via the top line data bus and the DEU A to Passenger Address (PA) loudspeakers. In the cockpit, the amber light (flashing) on the ATTendant transmission key on the audio control panel annunciate interphone calls, accompanied by a buzzer sounds. In the cabin, the area call panels and Attendant Indication Panels (AIPs) are used for annunciation. same communication mode, the source with the higher priority will have preference. If they have the same priority, the interphone source which was dialed first will be given preference. CALL FROM THE CABIN Interphone communications are done with the attendant station handsets which are connected to the type B Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs). To initiate a call, take the handset off the hook and then select the pushbutton on the keyboard. When the communication link is established, all the visual indications in the cabin are reset when the cabin handset is taken off its hook. All ATTND stations in the cabin have a RESET key to reset the interphone function, and proceeds to a new dialing.

Class 1 faults are recorded in the CFDS LAST/CURRENT LEG REPORT and the POST FLIGHT REPORT. GENERAL The indication of the failures depends on their importance. On the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP), there is a Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) CAUTion light in the upper left corner of the touchscreen. It is normally off. The CAUT light comes on amber and flashes when the active director (DIR) detects a fault that needs cabin crew action. The action needed is shown in the heading row (e.g. Please select Doors page). When you select the page, the CAUT light stops flashing and remains on continuously. If the fault is cleared the CAUT light goes off. For some faults, the required page is automatically shown on the FAP, there can also be a blue card message. This is a blue rectangle with a fault message written in amber. Major CIDS faults (class 1) are also indicated to the flight crew with Flight Warning System (FWS) level 2 or level 1 alerts. All CIDS faults generate Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS)/MCDU class 1, 2, 3 messages. Contrary to cockpit indications, the FAP failures indications do not depend on flight phases. NON CRITICAL CIDS FAULTS Non critical CIDS faults (e.g. Cabin Assignment Module (CAM) layout transmission failure) have no flight crew related effects, so there are no 'in flight' cockpit alerts. In most cases there is no FAP CAUT and/or message. However some of these faults are class 2 maintenance faults only. The cabin crew is not alerted, but these class 2 faults are indicated to the cockpit crew in flight on the ECAM STATUS page after manual selection and are the subject of an ECAM report (POST FLIGHT REPORT...) on the ground after engines shutdown. The ECAM STATUS page shows MAINTENANCE CIDS 1 (2). NOTE: The STATUS page does not appear automatically after a warning.

The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) is customizable. A system reconfiguration for the installation of options, cabin reconfiguration or CIDS expansion is limited to software database changes: the On Board Replaceable Module (OBRM) and the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The OBRM defines the operating software of the CIDS, and all connections to the related systems and emergency functions. The CAM defines the cabin layout. According to the program, the directors (DIRs) will consider the various cabin features and options validated by the CAM software and will make sure that the CIDS operates properly. This software is in the CAM A part. The CAM also has another essential role: To define all messages and page layouts of the FAP screen. It is known as CAM B. During the CIDS power-up, the DIRs will compare CAM and OBRM layout with their memories. If they find a difference, CAM data will be downloaded automatically. OBRM data can be downloaded manually by the FAP SOFTWARE LOADING page only. In the case of a total FAP failure combined with loss of the CAM and the OBRM flash cards, the CIDS will operate in restricted operating mode (basic functions active), thanks to the simplified operating software and cabin layout memory stored in the DIRs. The CIDS programming can operate on: - SOFTWARE LOADING, - CABIN PROGRAMMING, - LAYOUT SELECTION, - LEVEL ADJUSTMENT. To load the CIDS software, the SOFTWARE LOADING page on the FAP should be used (SW Load button). This page is protected by an access code and is only available on ground. Plug in new data storage hardware (OBRM flash card) to load the new software version. The FAP \"SOFTWARE LOADING\" page will show the CIDS hardware and software details as follows: - DIRs and FAP Part Numbers (PN), Serial Numbers (SN) and Functional Item Number (FIN), - active OBRM PN and software PN, - in slot OBRM PN and software PN. NOTE: Note: When the 'active' and 'in slot' data is different, it is highlighted in amber. If there is no difference, it is highlighted in green. NOTE: Note: The FAP pages are protected from unauthorized use by a password except for the FAP SET-UP page.

By moving over plastic materials (synthetic fibers), wearing synthetic fiber clothing, electrical charges build up on the body. Thus voltages of 12000 to 35000 volts can develop on a person. Touching connector pins of computer units, a discharge path is formed through wiring and components. Integrated Circuit (IC) chips can be partly damaged or totally destroyed. Rubbing materials from the \"tribo-electris\" series against each other and then separating them from each other causes a build-up of electrostatic charges. If the materials are far apart in the series, there will be a higher electric charge.

They are installed on the center pedestal, with an optional one installed on the overhead for the 3rd observer seat. The panels have an over center ON/OFF switch. When the ON/OFF switch is switched to the ON position, two frequencies that were previously selected appear in the ACTIVE and STandBY windows. To operate the transceiver, you might have to select a new frequency on one of the VHF or HF transceivers. To do this, you must select the transceiver that you wish to transmit on. To select the radio, the related radio pushbutton must be pushed on the RMP. The related green LED will come on. The desired frequency can be selected in the STand-BY/CouRSe window using the dual selector knob. Pressing the transfer pushbutton activates the frequency and displays it in the active window, whereas the previous active frequency transfers to the stand by window. the related reception knob must be released out. The reception knob comes on white. To adjust the reception volume level, the selected reception knob must be turned. Communication can now be established. VHF 1 OPERATION When a Push-to-Talk (PTT) switch is depressed on one of the hand mikes, the related hand mike is connected and the transceiver transmits. The boomset mike is connected to a transceiver when the INT/RAD switch is held in the RAD position on the ACP or the PTT is pressed on the side stick. On the ACP, several reception knobs can be selected simultaneously. If the reception knob is pressed in again, the receiver is disconnected and the white light goes off. TRANSMISSION MODE To connect one of the acoustic devices (microphone) to the transmission line, the related transmission key must be selected on the Audio Control Panel (ACP). When the transmission key is pressed (green light on) you are ready to transmit. This selection can be disabled when you select another transceiver or when you press the lighted pushbutton again. Only one transmit key can be selected at a time. RECEPTION MODE In order to listen on the selected transceiver, you must operate the Audio Control Panel (ACP).

With weight off wheels, the service interphone system is disabled due to the logic of the system. The on ground discrete from the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) disables all service interphone connections. The reason for this is to stop potential static noise started and amplified through the AMU due to the length of wires acting as antennae, into the audio system. To re-enable the service interphone, the SerViCE INTerphone OVeRriDe P/BSW must be switched to 'ON'.

The Digital Radio and Audio Integrating Management System (DRAIMS) received EASA certification in March 2020 for the A320 Family. The digital audio system will become the baseline for the A320 Family of aircraft over the next few years (and A330/A350) Here we look at the changes to the aircraft systems architecture linked to the installation of digital audio, what benefits it brings and the different operating modes from a flight crew perspective.

In the legacy architecture, the heart of the system, the Audio Management Unit (AMU), is connected to all peripheral equipment using multiple analogue links. Additional standalone computers such as the Cockpit Amplified Loudspeaker, the Audio Mixing box and the SELCAL box, perform functions not included in the AMU. IMPROVING AND STREAMLINING THE ARCHITECTURE The AMU has a completely new design. It now includes some of the previously external computers (such as the SELCAL box) and has a dual channel configuration with internal reconfiguration capability to improve robustness. Wherever it is technically feasible, links are now digital between the AMU and the peripheral equipment. Now, the RMPs (and not the AMU) manage the boomsets, headsets, hand microphones, oxygen mask microphones and loudspeakers. The power supply has been updated with dual power supply for RMP and AMU to ensure higher levels of equipment and function availability in the case of degraded electrical configurations. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) is principally based on two separate control panels, the Radio Management Panel (RMP) and the Audio Control Panel (ACP). There is some limited synchronisation between RMPs, and in case of system failure requiring reconfiguration, the flight crew need to intervene manually (AUDIO SWITCHING control). The digital audio system is designed to: \u2022 improve and streamline the architecture, simplifying installation and increasing robustness \u2022 update the HMI to bring it into line with solutions available on the A350 and A380 \u2022 increase synchronisation and simplify operating procedures to reduce crew workload \u2022 integrate additional functions and provide provisions for future upgrades and aircraft dispatch capability /remove airline tasks Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 224 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY NEW SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 225 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY NEW SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 226 of 232 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY DIGITAL RADIO AND AUDIO INTERGRATING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DRAIMS) D/O (3) OPERATION The RMP builds on the service-proven design from the proven A380 and A350 platforms, but takes into account the desire to implement new functions, as well as the physical installation constraints of the A320 center pedestal Different cockpit layouts are available according to operators' needs: 2 RMP + 1 ACP, 3 RMP or 3 RMP + ACP. The RMP has a single part number and can be programmed such that the HMI is coherent with the installed equipment. For example, if the aircraft is not equipped with an HF radio, then the associated menu key and transmissions keys will not be illuminated and pressing on those keys will have no effect. Some functions are controlled via a Line Select Key (LSK) and the RMP software can be programmed to give access, or not, as required (for example, CPDLC LOAD function), or to accurately reflect the aircraft configuration (for example, STBY NAV function and NAVAIDS listening). Different A320 cockpit layouts are available according to operators' needs: 2 RMP + 1 ACP, 3 RMP or 3 RMP + ACP. The RMP has a single part number and can be programmed such that the HMI is coherent with the installed equipment. Increasing synchronisation and simplifying operating procedures Some of the main changes are explained below, with further details provided in the section \"digital audio operating modes from a flight crew perspective\": \u2022 The RMP allows the pilot to see at a glance the active and standby frequencies selected for all the installed radios of each type (up to 3 VHF radios, 2 HF radios and single or dual channel SATCOM installations). The SEL indicator has been deleted. \u2022 All information is now fully synchronized between all RMPs in the cockpit. This includes active and standby frequencies of all installed radios, and STBY NAV tuning. \u2022 Shortcut keys have been implemented for the squawk codes and the principal operating modes of the TCAS. For example, if the aircraft is not equipped with an HF radio, then the associated menu key and transmissions keys will not be illuminated and pressing on those keys will have no effect. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) Some functions are controlled via a Line Select Key (LSK) and the RMP software can be programmed to give access, or not, as required (for example, CPDLC LOAD function), or to accurately reflect the aircraft configuration (for example, STBY NAV function and NAVAIDS listening). CATTS LTD \u2022 Alerts from the FWS, TCAS and GPWS are broadcast through the boomsets and headsets, in addition to the loudspeakers. \u2022 Failure case management has been simplified and the appropriate procedures are available in the FWS; for example, in case of RMP failure, the single action of switching off the associated RMP automatically activates the reconfiguration onto the remaining available HMI (RMP or ACP).

The IDG oil cooler is connected to the IDG by [ two oil connections (in and out). Temperature sensors sense the IDG oil inlet and oil outlet temperatures. The Generator Control Unit (GCU) monitors the oil outlet sensor for indication on the ECAM and for advisory and overheat detection/indication. The GCU compares the oil in and oil out temperature to determine the IDG internal temperature rise. From this data, the GCU can determine if there is an internal IDG problem or an external cooling problem. An open circuit of the IDG oil outlet temperature sensor is a class 3 fault, and no flight deck effects are presented. The GCU will automatically provide the IDG oil inlet temperature plus a nominal temperature offset and display it as the oil outlet temperature on the ECAM ELEC page. [ A pressure switch senses low IDG oil charge pressure. The switch is monitored by the GCU for the low oil pressure fault warning. OPERATION PRINCIPLE A scavenge pump in the IDG pumps the oil through the [ scavenge filter and the IDG oil cooler. The engine heat management system regulates the fuel flow through the IDG oil cooler to cool the IDG oil. A [ charge pump provides regulated cooled oil supply pressure to [ the generator and other users. The purpose of the IDG oil cooler bypass valve is to protect the IDG oil from overcooling. Note that the cooler bypass valve is not part of the engine fuel/oil heat management system. COLD CONDITIONS In cold conditions (oil temp \\<40\u00b0C), the oil pressure increases due to high oil viscosity, then [ the cooler bypass valve opens to bypass the IDG oil cooler. When IDG oil temperature is between 40\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C, [ the valve is in the regulating position. This position mixes uncooled oil from the IDG and cooled oil from the IDG Oil Cooler and returns it to the IDG. FILTER CLOGGED A clogged filter indication is provided by a local visual [ Delta Pressure pop-out Indicator (DPI). In case of clogging filter condition, [ the visual indicator pops out. The DPI reset can be done in some conditions and associated with maintenance procedures. When the filter is clogged, [ the relief valve opens.

The engine must be stopped for IDG reconnection. OIL TEMPERATURE MONITORING Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil temperature sensors monitor the input and the output oil temperature. If a high difference between the input and the output temperature is detected, a status message is sent to the ECAM. The difference is called a temperature rise. The normal IDG oil inlet temperature is between 40\u00b0C to 105\u00b0C. When the oil outlet temperature reaches 142\u00b0C, an advisory mode is available on the lower ECAM. If the oil outlet temperature is equal to or more than 185\u00b0C the master caution is triggered, and a manual disconnection is written on the ECAM. If the oil outlet temperature is more than 200\u00b0C the IDG is automatically disconnected. OIL PRESSURE MONITORING A pressure switch operates in case of oil low pressure (lower than 140 psi) not caused by underspeed. THERMAL IDG DISCONNECTION If the IDG disconnection is not performed at 185\u00b0C, the temperature will increase and at 200\u00b0C an automatic thermal disconnection should occur to protect the IDG. A warning message is sent to the ECAM system and a BITE MESSAGE (THERMAL DISCONNECT) is sent to the CFDS. If this thermal disconnection fails, the message \"THERMAL DISC. FAILED\" is sent to the CFDS and a warning message is sent to the ECAM system. Note: After a thermal disconnection, the IDG must be replaced. The class 2 message \"IDG OIL DELTA TEMP\" is generated by the system BITE. If there is no difference between the input and the output temperature, the class 2 message \"IDG COOLER\" is generated by the system BITE. In both cases, the \"AC GEN MAINTENANCE STATUS\" is displayed on the ECAM STATUS page. TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE INDICATION The oil outlet temperature is displayed on the ECAM System Display. In case of high oil outlet temperature or oil low pressure, the following warnings are triggered: - MASTER CAUTION light, - Single chime, - The message \"ELEC IDG 1(2) OIL OVHT or ELEC IDG 1(2) OIL LO PR\" is displayed on the EWD, - The FAULT legend on the corresponding IDG P/BSW comes on amber. The IDG must be disconnected immediately by: - Opening the safety guard, - Pushing the IDG P/BSW for a maximum of 3 seconds. Note: Disconnection is only possible if the related engine is running above underspeed.

Note that the PMG is mounted on the IDG differential output gear. The PMG frequency signal is compared with a GCU internal frequency reference. The difference, between the actual PMG frequency and the frequency reference, [ creates an error signal in the servovalve control loop circuitry. The frequency error signal is then used to control the servovalve current flow via the SVR. The servovalve works by porting oil to an hydraulic control cylinder which determines the position of [ a variable displacement hydraulic unit. Depending on the error signal, the servovalve ports more or less oil to the cylinder to maintain the desired [ generator frequency (IDG output speed). As IDG speed (thus PMG frequency) decreases below the reference frequency setpoint, the servovalve supplies current increases, resulting in an IDG output speed increase. During normal operation, the SVR is closed to allow current flow in the servovalve control loop. Under certain channel failure conditions, the SVR is opened to make sure that the servovalve drive current from the GCU is completely removed. GENERAL The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) consists of a [ Constant Speed Drive (CSD) and an [ AC generator mounted side by side in a single housing. [ The CSD components convert a variable input speed to a constant output speed. The CSD portion of the IDG is a hydromechanical device that adds to or subtracts from the variable input speed of the engine gearbox. The CSD performs this operation by controlled differential action to maintain the constant output speed required to drive the AC generator. The IDG is cooled and lubricated by the oil circulation system. [ The oil is cooled by an external mounted IDG oil cooler. IDG DRIVE CONTROL The Constant Speed Drive converts the variable input speed [ provided by the engine gearbox to the constant [ output speed through the CSD hydromechanical components. IDG SPEED CONTROL ENGINE SPEED SENSING The Generator Control Unit (GCU) performs the output speed control for the IDG via the servovalve control loop whenever several conditions are met: - [ The GCU is powered-up, - [ Engine input speed to the IDG is sufficient for speed control to begin, - No failure is present in the channel to trip the servovalve control circuit. The FADEC provides the GCU with the corresponding engine speed information, which is also used for the underspeed protections. SERVOVALVE CONTROL LOOP The servovalve control loop is composed of a hydraulic servovalve in the IDG and control circuitry in the [ GCU which includes the ServoValve Relay (SVR). The output speed control is performed as follows: the GCU control circuit monitors [ the Permanent Magnet Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) OIL TEMPERATURE SENSING There are two oil temperature sensors in the IDG: - [ One on the IDG oil inlet port, - [ One on the IDG oil outlet port. Both sensors are thermistors. The GCU uses the sensor signals to determine oil inlet, oil outlet and rise temperature for IDG protection. The temperature information is also sent to the ECAM. If oil outlet temperature is above 185\u00b0C, [ the FAULT legend comes on amber on the IDG pushbutton. CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 34 of 255 delta pRESSURE indicator (dpi) FIRE SWITCH The scavenge filter is fitted with an oil filter [ Differential Pressure Indicator (DPI). If the delta pressure across the scavenge filter is 50 \u00b1 8 psi, the [ DPI (pop-out) shows the clogged position. In that case, the IDG should be serviced. In case of engine fire, if the related fire switch is pressed in, a 28V DC signal is sent to the corresponding GCU, which shuts down its IDG. In such a case, the reset of the GCU is not required. OIL PRESSURE SWITCH A Low Oil Pressure (LOP) switch located in the IDG charge oil circuit provides a signal to the GCU when IDG charge oil pressure is less than 140 psi. In low oil pressure condition, not caused by underspeed, [ the IDG pushbutton FAULT legend comes on amber and an ECAM warning is triggered. IDG DISCONNECTION The IDG P/B FAULT legend comes on if the IDG oil pressure is less than 140 psi or if the IDG oil outlet temperature is above 185\u00b0C. In both conditions, the IDG must immediately be disconnected! IDG disconnection is achieved by [ a solenoid activated clutch. It must be performed, via the IDG switch if the [ IDG pushbutton FAULT legend is on. If the temperature reaches 200\u00b0C, [ a solder fuse melts and automatically releases the disconnect mechanism to open the IDG disconnect clutch. When the IDG pushbutton is depressed and no underspeed is detected, [ a 28V DC signal is sent to the disconnection solenoid which will [ open the clutch. In case of low oil pressure due to underspeed, the FAULT legend remains off. In underspeed condition, it is not possible to disconnect the IDG. After a thermal disconnection, the IDG must be changed. IDG reset must be performed on the ground with the engine shutdown, by pulling the [ reset ring mounted on the IDG casing.

The generator rotor consists of an exciter rotor, a diode rectifier assembly, and a two-pole main field rotor. The exciter rotor and main field rotor are mounted on a common shaft supported by a roller bearing set at the drive end and a ball bearing set at the opposite end. The Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG) rotor is mounted on the outputting gear of the differential assembly. The main generator stator, exciter stator, PMG stator and generator Current Transformer (CT) are mounted in the IDG housing. The exciter stage of the generator consists of a three-phase winding rotor which is located on the main generator rotor shaft. The stator windings and a full wave bridge rectifier (rotating diode rectifier) are also located on the rotor shaft. As it rotates, the exciter stage converts a DC field voltage to an AC voltage. The AC voltage is rectified by the rotating diode rectifier and is supplied to the main generator rotor. MAIN GENERATOR The main generator consists of a two-pole rotor and a three-phase winding stator. As the rotor rotates, the DC field induces an AC voltage in the stator windings. PERMANENT MAGNET GENERATOR (PMG) CURRENT TRANSFORMER The PMG consists of a 16-pole permanent magnet rotor and a three-winding stator. As the engine is running, the PMG rotor induces an AC voltage in the windings of the PMG stator. At normal operation speed, the output from the PMG is: - 3 phases - 1681,3 Hz - 110 VAC. The output of the PMG is supplied to the Generator Control Unit (GCU) which uses it for the following functions: - The GCU transforms and rectifies the voltage via a Transformer Rectifier (TR) to 28V DC for the internal power supply. - The GCU sends the PMG voltage via the Generator Control Relay (GCR) to the voltage and frequency regulation circuit where it is rectified and applied to the exciter field for voltage regulation. The PMG frequency is also used to monitor the generator frequency (for the IDG drive control). Current Transformers (CTs) monitor the 3-phase feeder cables, from the Generator to the GLC. The GCUs use the CT outputs for protection functions (differential current, overcurrent, overload). One CT is located inside the IDG and the other is just before the GLC. They are called the 3-Hole Current Transformers. From the engine pylon to the forward cargo compartment, each feeder cable is split into two, so that there are now two cables per phase (total 6). Another CT, located in the forward cargo compartment, monitors the 6-feeder cables. It is called the 6-Hole Current Transformer. The GCU monitors its current output for open cable protection. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd UNDERSPEED Each GCU receives engine speed data from the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) via an ARINC 429 bus. These data are used for the underspeed set point, various other controls and protections and BITE functions. If these data are not available, the GCU uses the PMG frequency to determine the input speed of the generator.

When the GEN P/BSW is pressed in (on position) and the generator is not connected, the GEN COMMAND circuit is supplied, enabling the closure of the GCR to excite the generator. If all generator parameters are correct, the Power Ready Relay (PRR) closes and connects power to the Generator Line Contactor (GLC) via the GLC AUX RELAY. The GLC opens or closes to connect 115V AC to the network according to priority rules and the network supply status. The FAULT legend comes on amber if during operation any parameter is incorrect. At this time the GCR, PRR and the GLC all open. The SVR will also open if FAULT is frequency related. Additionally, the FAULT light comes on in the following cases: - The related engine is shutdown or the generator is not connected - If the GLC has failed open (STUCK OPEN) When the GEN P/BSW is released out (off position), the OFF legend appears in white. The GCR opens (if not already open) to de-energize the generator field and the GLC opens. In addition, the computer reset circuit is supplied to reset the GCU. POINT OF REGULATION The Point Of Regulation (POR) is located between the 3-hole CT and the GLC. It takes in to account the generator feeder impedance (voltage drop of 1 to 2V AC). The GCU monitors the three-generator phase voltages at the POR for: - Voltage regulation control, - Over and undervoltage protection, - Incorrect Phase Sequence protection. VOLTAGE REGULATION The GCU monitors the POR in order to keep the voltage at nominal value (115V AC) at this point. The principle of operation of the voltage regulator is by modulation of the voltage through the exciter field. The output from the PMG is connected via the GCR to the excitation and regulation control module, where it is converted into DC voltage and applied to the exciter field. The voltage frequency regulation module senses the average of the three phases at the POR and compares it against a reference voltage. If a difference exists, the voltage regulator adjusts the exciter field current as needed to keep a constant voltage at the POR.

If the internal FAULT legend in the IDG P/BSW comes on, the IDG must immediately be disconnected by raising the IDG P/BSW guard and pushing the switch. When the IDG P/BSW is pushed, the FAULT legend goes out. With the engine stopped, the IDG cannot be manually disconnected. An underspeed condition, generated by the GCU, inhibits the disconnection. Notice that for a static test of the IDG disconnect mechanism, the circuit breaker 2XU1 must be pulled to simulate a running engine 1 and no underspeed.

Each IDG is a two-pole high-speed (24 000 rpm) brushless spray oil cooled unit. It comprises the drive part and the generator part in a common housing. The generator part has a Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), an exciter generator with rotating diodes and the main generator. Each IDG is controlled and monitored by its own Generator Control Unit (GCU). The OFF legend comes on when the P/BSW is released out. After a fault detection (tripping of the generator), cycling the GEN 1(2) switch OFF/ON resets the GCU. GEN 1 LINE P/BSW In SMOKE configuration (red smoke light on) an activation of this P/BSW opens the GLC but the generator stays energized to supply directly the fuel pumps 1 LH and 1 RH side (the OFF legend indicates, the P/BSW position). Notice that during the AVIONICS SMOKE procedure (GEN 1 LINE P/BSW OFF), the related generator FAULT light remains off. GCU GLC/BTC CONTROL AND MONITORING Each Generator Control Unit (GCU) is supplied by the PMG from its related IDG and, as a back-up, through the battery bus 301PP. The related engine under speed information is given by the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). The main functions of the GCU are: - control of the field excitation via the Generator Control Relay (GCR), - voltage regulation via the Excitation Control and Regulation module, - speed regulation through the ServoValve Relay (SVR), - control of the Generator Line Contactor (GLC) via the Power Ready Relay (PRR), the Bus Tie Contactor (BTC) and the AUX RELAY 1, - control and protection of the IDG and the network. The GLC and the BTC are under control of the related GCU and the Bus Tie Logic. If all parameters are correct, the GLC connects the generator to its own bus bar. The BTC connects the generator to the transfer line or another power source to the bus bar (with generator off) depending on the priority logic. GENERATOR P/BSW The generator P/BSW is used to connect or disconnect the generator output to or from the bus bar, and to reset the GCU. The FAULT legend comes on when the P/BSW is pressed in and the related engine is shutdown or during operation if any parameter is not correct. The fault information is sent via the SDACs to the ECAM.

Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 54 of 255 OPERATION - GEN 1 LINE OFF Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 55 of 255 GCU D/O (3) GENERAL FREQUENCY REGULATION The Generator Control Unit (GCU) 1 and 2 are identical and interchangeable. Pin programming provides the GCU with the following information: - the aircraft type, - the GCU position, - the current limit for voltage regulation, - the load limit. The main functions of the GCU are: - regulation of the generator voltage, - regulation of the generator frequency, - regulation of the generator speed (ServoValve (SV) control), - control and protection of the network and the generator, - interface with System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDACs) for the ECAM, - interface with Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) for engine speed, - interface with Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) via the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU). The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) frequency is regulated by a servovalve in the IDG and the servovalve control circuit in the GCU (via the SV relay). The PMG frequency is compared with a GCU internal reference frequency. The difference generates a control current to drive the servovalve to produce the right output frequency. CONTROL AND PROTECTION The GCU control and protection functions are mainly performed by 3 internal relays: - the GCR controls the generator excitation, - the Power Ready Relay (PRR) controls the GLC, - the SV relay controls the IDG speed. If a protection function is triggered, the GCR, the PRR and, in some cases the SV relay, are de-energized. VOLTAGE REGULATION The voltage regulation is achieved by regulating the current through the exciter field. The voltage is kept at a nominal value (115V AC) at the Point Of Regulation (POR). The POR is located at the end of the generator feeder upstream of the Generator Line Contactor (GLC). The output from the Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG) is connected via the Generator Control Relay (GCR) to the excitation and regulation control module for frequency monitoring use. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd UNDERSPEED Engine speed information provided by FADEC is used to sense the IDG input speed. When engine speed falls below the underspeed threshold the PRR trips and the excitation is biased off due to underfrequency. In case of an absent FADEC speed signal to the GCU, a back-up signal is provided by the engine master switch to inform the GCU logic that the engine will shut down. Note: in case of detected underspeed (e.g. engine shut down) no reset action via the GEN P/BSW is required. OVERVOLTAGE The GCU performs an overvoltage protection function. If the highest individual phase at POR reaches 130 \u00b1 1.5 volts, the PRR and the GCR are tripped. The higher the voltage, the faster the relays trip. Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 56 of 255 OVERFREQUENCY The GCU performs an overfrequency protection function. If the frequency is above 435 \u00b1 1Hz, for at least 4 seconds, the GCU trips the PRR and the GCR. If the frequency is above 452 Hz, for at least 160 milliseconds, the GCU trips the PRR, the GCR and also the SV relay. OVERLOAD / OVERCURRENT The IDG Current Transformers (CTs) provide current sensing information to the GCU. This information is used to determine generator load for overload, overcurrent, phase imbalance (delta) and also Differential Current Protection. In case of overload, the GCU sends signals to the SDAC for an ECAM message and to the FAULT light on the GALY & CAB P/BSW. If an IDG fails, the Bus Tie Contactors (BTCs) close and some galleys loads are automatically shed. GCUs monitor BTC status and determine if overcurrent protection (BTC lockout) should be inhibited. If the galleys are not automatically shed the BTC lockout is inhibited, to allow the GALY & CAB P/BSW to be selected OFF.

A 6 hole CT monitors each cable. If an open cable is detected, or if the ENG FIRE P/BSW is released out, the GCU trips the GCR and the PRR. The GLC opens after the PRR trips. DIFFERENTIAL CURRENT PROTECTION The Differential Protection is based on the comparison of each phase of the Line 3-hole CT and the CTs in the IDG. If a differential current flow is above 50 \u00b1 10A for at least 60 milliseconds, the PRR and GCR are tripped. Note: the Differential Protection circuit reset is done via the GEN P/BSW, but it is limited to two attempts. After correcting the fault a cold reset must be performed.

Switch all power off and then on again to reset the fault logic; this is called a cold reset. Most fault protections allow two reset attempts and then the reset function is inhibited. BITE The GCU is a type 1 computer. Its BITE detects and isolates active and passive failures. The BITE consists of two sections: - Operational BITE, - Maintenance BITE. After generator tripping, the operational BITE identifies the protection, analyses the conditions and determines the fault origin. The maintenance BITE completes the operational BITE and performs a self-test of the GCU to provide an indication of system integrity. Faults are kept in the Non Volatile Memory (NVM). The GCU BITE communicates with the CFDS via the GAPCU (type 1 system). INTERFACE Each GCU is interfaced to both SDACs to transmit system failure or caution data to the ECAM. The Landing Gear Control and Interface unit (LGCIU) 1 provides ground/flight information to the GCU (BITE).

It is driven at a constant speed by the APU and can be connected to the electrical network. It can supply the entire electrical network if no other power sources are available. APU GENERATOR CONTROL The APU Generator control module is part of the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU). The main functions of the module are: - voltage regulation, - frequency monitoring, - APU Generator Line Contactor (GLC) control in accordance with the bus tie logic, - control and Protection, - [ Interface with System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs), - Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) function. The BITE messages are sent to the CFDIU. CONTROL, INDICATION AND DISTRIBUTION The APU generator is controlled by a P/BSW located on the overhead ELEC panel and has two lights: white OFF and amber FAULT. The APU GEN is connected to the network via the APU GLC and the Bus Tie Contactors (BTCs). APU GEN OIL TEMPERATURE SENSOR A temperature sensor is located on the APU generator oil outlet port. A high oil temperature leads to an immediate automatic shut down of the APU via the Electronic Control Box (ECB). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 64 of 255 APU GENERATOR ... APU GEN OIL TEMPERATURE SENSOR Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 65 of 255 AC AUXILIARY GENERATION D/O (3) APU GENERATOR APU GEN CONTROL AND MONITORING The APU generator can supply all or part of the normal network, depending on the priority logic given by the bus tie logic. The APU generator is a two-pole high speed (24 000 rpm) brushless spray oil cooled generator. Speed regulation is made by the APU engine without a Constant Speed Drive (CSD); it is not interchangeable with the Integrated Drive Generators (IDGs).The APU generator is cooled and lubricated by the APU oil. An oil temperature bulb is installed on the APU generator oil outlet part. The bulb is directly connected to the APU [ Electronic Control Box (ECB). In case of oil temperature above 185\u00b0C, the ECB commands an immediate [ shutdown of the APU. The APU generator switch is used to connect or disconnect the APU generator and to reset the GAPCU. - The FAULT legend only comes on if the switch is pressed in, the APU is running (>95%), and one parameter is not correct. - The OFF legend comes on when the switch is released out. After a fault detection (tripping of the generator), the GAPCU must be reset by setting the switch to OFF and back to ON. The APU Generator Line Contactor (GLC) is under control of the GAPCU and the bus tie logic. If all generator parameters are correct, the AGLC connects the generator to [ the transfer line. The connection to the busbars depends on the priority logic and the network supply status (BTCs and GLCs). APU GEN CONTROL MODULE (GAPCU) The APU Generator Control Module is part of the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU). The GAPCU controls both the APU generator and the EXT PWR. The power for the GAPCU is supplied by: - the APU Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), - the EXT PWR, - the BATtery BUS as a back-up supply. The control module main functions are: - control of the field excitation through the Generator Control Relay (GCR), - voltage regulation, - control of the APU Generator Line Contactor (GLC) through the Power Ready Relay (PRR) in conjunction with the bus tie logic, - control and protection of the APU generator and the network. The GAPCU has an interface with the SDAC and to the CFDIU. APU ECB carries out the speed regulation. At 95% rpm, the ECB sends an APU ready signal to the GAPCU. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) TRANSFER CIRCUIT The transfer circuit has a [ transfer line and the two [ BTCs. This circuit lets the power sources (GEN 1, 2, APU, External Power) supply all or half of the network according to the priority and the bus tie logic. The bus tie logic gives information about the network supply status. This information is used for: - Non parallel operation, - Supply priority, - Transfer circuit control. APU GEN FEEDER CABLES The feeder cables are routed through the cabin ceiling to the rear C/B panel in the cockpit where they are sent through a [ 3-hole current transformer before connection to the APU GLC. [ The Current Transformer (CT) gives differential current protection. CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 66 of 255 OPERATION The purpose of this paragraph is to describe the operation of the APU with or without GEN1. ONLY APU RUNNING With the APU running and the APU GEN pushbutton in the ON position, the connection to the transfer network is only possible if one or both of the IDG Generators are offline and the External electrical power not connected. Two sets of contacts from the de-energized EPC AUX relay and the contacts from the de-energized EPC make sure that the APU GLC voltage supply is interrupted even if the PRR of the APU Generator GCU is energized. If the EPC AUX and the EPC are de-energized (no ground electrical power) the contacts of the IDG's GLCs and the BTCs will then determine if the APU GLC will be energized. If the IDG's GLCs are de-energized and the BTCs are energized, the APU GLC is then energized and the APU generator supplies the transfer network.

GROUND POWER CONTROL & MONITORING EXT PWR NOT IN USE (AVAILABLE) When the Maintenance Bus switch is selected to ON, the Not In Use legend comes off on the External Electrical power panel and the GPU then supplies the A/C service buses. The AVAIL legend remains on, on the 35VU. DESCRIPTION The 115V AC, 400 Hz, 3 phase output of the GPU is connected to the aircraft network through the EPC and Bus Tie Contactors (BTCs).The GAPCU monitors permanently the quality of the delivered ground power. The monitoring and control of the connection and disconnection is made by two internal relays. The Interlock Monitoring Relay (IMR) and the Power Ready Relay (PRR). At least one faulty parameter opens both relays. PRR AND IMR POWER SUPPLY The IMR is energized when: - The interlock voltage is more than 13V DC, less than 42V DC and less than 60V AC. - All control and protection parameters are valid. The PRR is energized when: - The external power interlock is valid, - And all parameters are correct. The annunciators NOT IN USE and AVAILABLE located on the external power panel are ON. SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTION (PTC) If a short circuit occurs on the PRR output line sensed by the Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) sensor, the red PTC TRIP LED on the front face of the GAPCU comes on and a BITE message is sent to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).

Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 80 of 255 OPERATION - EXT PWR IN USE (ON) Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 81 of 255 GAPCU D/O (3) MONITORING GENERAL The Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU) controls the APU Generator (GEN) and the External Power System. The APU Generator Line Contactor (GLC), the External Power Contactor (EPC) and their related Auxiliary Relays can only close when the correct conditions exist. They are opened manually or automatically, by the control and protection circuits. The GAPCU also performs BITE analysis and communication, and interfaces with other systems: - Generator Control Units (GCUs), - APU Electronic Control Box (ECB), - Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), - System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs), - Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1. POWER SUPPLY The GAPCU internal power supply module can be supplied by the external power or the APU GEN via internal Transformer/Rectifiers (TRs). The supply module also has a back up supply from the BAT BUS. EXT PWR CONTROL The GAPCU performs the following functions for the external power control and BITE: - monitoring, - interlock function, - External Power Contactor (EPC) control, - protection, - BITE function, - communication and interface. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd The GAPCU permanently monitors the quality of the external power supply. A faulty parameter automatically disconnects the external power from the transfer line opening the Power Ready Relay (PRR) to open the EPC, and Interlock Monitoring Relay (IMR) to trip the ground cart. In some GAPCU failure conditions, the back-up card can control the PRR, so that the external power can still be connected to the aircraft. In these cases, after a \"cold reset\" the PRR closes and the external power is supplied to the aircraft with limited protection. In that case, no bite function is available. EPC CONTROL The closed PRR provides 28V DC to the solenoid of the EPC AUX relay (5XG). The AUX relay is responsible for opening and closing of the main contactor (EPC). The EPC AUX relay is also responsible for the priority switching, i.e. the External Power over the APU GEN. When the EXT PWR P/BSW is pressed the FLIP/FLOP provides a fixed ground signal to close the EPC AUX relay. Depending on the network supply status, the EPC AUX relay connects power via the de-energized APU GLC, to the EPC. The EPC then connects the GPU to the transfer line. When the EXT PWR P/BSW is pressed again, the FLIP/FLOP removes the ground so that the AUX relay and EPC open. PROTECTION The GAPCU performs the following protection functions for the external power: - over and under voltage, - over and under frequency, - over current, - overload, - EXT PWR interlock, - Incorrect Phase Sequence (IPS), - open cable or open/short circuit, Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 82 of 255 - EPC failure. The Over Voltage (OV) protection is accomplished by monitoring the highest phase voltage at the Point Of Reference (POR). An OV condition exists when the highest phase voltage exceeds 130 +/- 1,5V AC. After an inverse delay, the IMR, PRR and EPC are tripped. The Under Voltage (UV) is sensed in the same way as OV. An UV condition exists when the lowest phase voltage is less than 101,5 +/1,5V AC. After a 4,5 second time delay max, the PRR, IMR and EPC are tripped. An over current on the wiring between the PRR and the aircraft bus (1000XG) will change the status of the Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) sensor (high impedance). The sensor then provides a signal to switch on the red PTC LED on the front face of the GAPCU and sends a BITE message to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). The PTC and the PTC LED are only supplied if the EXT PWR remains connected to the receptacle (i.e. PRR is still closed). The LED is not a \"latched\" status signal. Thus, if a short circuit does exist, and the LED is illuminated, it will go off as soon as the external power is removed from the receptacle. (tripping of the generator), the control and must be reset by setting the P/BSW to OFF and back to on. APU GLC CONTROL AND MONITORING The APU GLC is under control of the APU GLC AUX relay and the GLC/BTC logic. If all APU GEN parameters are correct, the APU GLC connects the APU GEN power to the transfer line. overheat protection An oil temperature bulb is installed on the APU GEN oil outlet port. The bulb is directly connected to the APU ECB. In case of oil temperature above 185\u00b0C, the ECB commands an immediate shutdown of the APU. COMMUNICATION AND INTERFACE The GAPCU is connected with the GCUs, the CFDIU and the SDACs. WITH THE GCU The GAPCU communicates with the two GCUs via MIL-STD 1553 links. WITH THE CFDIU APU GEN CONTROL The GAPCU is the CFDS interface for the enhanced Electrical Power Generation System (EPGS). The GAPCU communicates with the CFDIU via ARINC 429 links. During normal mode of transmission, the GAPCU continuously sends its own and the two GCUs fault data, to the CFDIU. The main functions are: - control of the field excitation through the Generator Control Relay (GCR), - voltage regulation, - control of the APU GLC through the PRR in conjunction with the BTC/GLC logic, - control and protection of the APU GEN and the network. WITH THE SDAC The GAPCU continuously communicates with the SDACs via ARINC 429 links. The SDACs provide system data and fault data to the ECAM. APU P/BSW The APU GEN P/BSW is used to connect or disconnect the APU GEN and to reset the APU GEN control part. After a fault detection Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 83 of 255 INTERFACE WITH LGCIU 1 The GAPCU receives a flight/ground discrete signal from LGCIU 1.

The order of these priorities is: 1- On side Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) to own busbars, the IDG 1 to AC BUS 1 and the IDG 2 to AC BUS 2. 2- External Power (EXT PWR). 3- APU Generator (APU GEN). 4- Opposite IDG (IDG 1 to AC BUS 1 and 2 or IDG 2 to AC BUS 2 and 1). The Bus Tie Push Button Switch (PB/Sw) is used to control the Bus Tie Contactors (BTCs) of the AC Buses only. DC Bus Tie Logic and DC BTC control is independent of the AC Logic and automatic. BATTERIES CONNECTED With battery power only, the BTCs are closed because all the other contactors and auxiliary relays are open. The BTC power supply is from the BAT BUS. When APU GEN or EXT PWR are available, the BTC power supply is provided by the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU). Note: The BTC ground path is provided by the related Generator Control Unit (GCU). This is a protection against Over Current. It inhibits an automatic transfer to a network fault, by inhibiting the BTC close logic (BTC lockout).

The drive speed varies according to the engine rating. The IDG internal gearing, converts the variable gearbox frequency to a stable 400 Hz. The IDG supplies a 115 V AC, 3-phase, and 400 Hz AC. At some point, servicing will be required of the IDG. In this module you will see a video that will demonstrate the correct servicing procedures of the IDG. Check the oil level and the filter Differential Pressure Indicator (DPI) each 150 Flight Hours (FH) or each time the engine cowls are opened. Depending on when the time schedule occurs there might be a reason, during transit checks, that you must check the oil level and the filter DPI each 150 FH or each time the engine cowls are opened. On each engine, use the sight glass that is in the vertical position to do the check of the oil level. If it is below the green band or above the yellow band, do the oil servicing. Clogged filter indication is provided by a visual pop out indicator (the DPI) mounted on the IDG. This indicator is installed opposite the drive end of the IDG.

The amber FAULT legend of the ELECtrical/IDG1 or 2 P/BSW comes on, the master warning system is triggered. In this case, the IDG must be disconnected manually. For this, the PUSH-TO-DISConnect IDG1 (2) safety guarded P/BSW, installed on the panel 35 VU, must be pushed. CAUTION: ENGAGE THE IDG DISCONNECT MECHANISM WITH THE DISCONNECT RESET RING BEFORE YOU START THE ENGINE. IF NOT, YOU WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE GEAR TEETH, AT ENGINE START. YOU CAN DAMAGE THE DISCONNECT SOLENOID BECAUSE OF OVERHEATING IF: YOU PUSH THE IDG DISCONNECT P/BSW FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS. THERE MUST BE AT LEAST 60 SECONDS BETWEEN 2 OPERATIONS OF THE SWITCH. On the ELEC control panel, push the IDG 1 (2) P/BSW. On the IDG 1 (2), slowly pull out the disconnect reset ring to the full limit of travel. If you feel a click while you hold the disconnect reset ring, this shows that the disconnect function operates correctly. Let the disconnect reset ring go slowly back to the initial position. CAUTION: USE ONLY NEW CANS OF OIL WHEN YOU FILL THE IDG WITH OIL OR ADD OIL TO THE IDG. THE CONTAMINATION IN THE OIL RAPID DETERIORATION OF THE OIL AND WILL DECREASE THE LIFE OF THE IDG. Make the thrust reverser unserviceable, Depressurize the IDG case, CAUTION: USE ONLY APPROVED TYPES/BRANDS OF LUBRICANTS. DO NOT MIX TYPES/BRANDS OF LUBRICANTS. Fill the IDG with filtered oils at a maximum pressure of 35 PSI (2.4131 bar), Inspect the oil level before and after the related engine start. Inspect the oil level after it becomes stable (5 minutes after running), If the oil level is at or near the top of the green band, oil servicing is not necessary. If the oil level is below the green band or above the yellow band, servicing is necessary. NOTE: The IDG disconnection is irreversible in flight. Reconnection of the system is then possible only on the ground with engines shut down.

This prevents an automatic deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT). In flight, when there is a total failure of the two AC main buses and when the aircraft speed is higher than 100 kts, the two relays 17XE and 18XE are de-energized, which supplies relay 20XE with +28VDC from the hot battery bus 703PP. Relay 20XE is then energized after 1 second.and +28VDC are supplied from the Hot Battery Bus to the RAT solenoid 1 and the Constant Speed Motor Generator (CSM/G) Generator Control Unit (GCU) through the de-energized contacts of relay 22XE. The RAT extends automatically. The Constant Speed Motor/Generator (CSM/G) control unit activates the CSM/G solenoid valve and uses battery 2 for the supply voltage. The generator starts to operate.

Relay K1 is then energized, allowing the solenoid control valve to be supplied by the internal bus (still on battery 2). Relay K3 is held closed by the GCU internal supply via relay K2 and the time delay-opening transistor. When the emergency generator parameters are correct (voltage and frequency above voltage and frequency threshold), or after 10 s equal to the Constant Speed Motor/Generator (CSM/G) start sequence, relay K2 closes. The Generator Line Contactor (GLC) closes and relay K3 is de-energized, allowing the solenoid control valve power supply change over from battery 2 to the Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG). The CSM/G can also be started manually via the MANual ON P/BSW. NOTE: The diagram shows the system in normal configuration (K3 de-energized, solenoid control valve supplied by PMG). SPEED REGULATION The speed regulation module of the control unit electrically controls the servo-valve, which regulates the hydraulic motor speed. The GCU maintains the CSM/G at constant speed by: - monitoring the frequency of the PMG, - and comparing it with a quartz crystal controlled reference. The resulting error signal is then used to control the CSM/G servo-valve to a more open or close position. VOLTAGE REGULATION The PMG supplies the exciter field through a voltage regulation module. The GCU maintains the CSM/G output voltage constant by monitoring the voltage at the Point Of Regulation (POR). The output voltage is compared to 115V AC reference and used as an operational error to regulate the field current.

The protections are the following: - over/under voltage, - over/under frequency, - shorted PMG, - fast over speed shutdown. When a failure is detected, relay K1 opens to de-energize the solenoid control valve: The generator stops operating. The MAN ON P/BSW must be pressed in to reset the protection module and to recover the solenoid control valve power supply. NOTE: The diagram shows the system after fault detection, and before the generator stops (solenoid control valve de-energized). The MAN ON P/BSW is not pressed in yet.

In emergency power condition (AC buses not powered, A/C in flight, and Airspeed greater than 100kts) the automatic control logic being set, the Generator Control Unit (GCU) internal 28V DC bus is supplied by battery 2 through relay K3. Relay K1 is then energized, allowing the solenoid control valve to be supplied by the internal bus (still on battery 2). Relay K3 is held closed by the GCU internal supply via relay K2 and the time delay-opening transistor. The emergency generator stops as soon as the airspeed is below 100kts and the A/C is on ground. At 100kts a ground is removed from relay 3PH thus allowing for a discrete to be supplied to the CSM/G CU as soon as the Main L/G compresses. After a 400ms delay the GCU de-energizes relay K2 and K1, which in turn causes the EMER GLC to de-energize, and the stoppage of the servo control of the generator respectively. When the EMERgency GENerator test pushbutton 16XE is pressed in, relay 3PH energizes simulating a loss of AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2 and a speed higher than 100 kts. The generator then comes online supplying the ESSential bus network until 16XE is released.

In order to improve this situation, in some of the affected areas the floor panels can optionally be heated, i.e. those of the front doors (door area 1) with all Airbus Single Aisle aircraft and those of the center and emergency exits (door areas 2 and 3) with A321. The areas of the aft doors, however, are never heated with either aircraft. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 65 of 177 GENERAL Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 66 of 177 HEATED FLOOR PANEL SYSTEM D/O (OPTION) (3) LOCATION DOOR AREA 1 (OPTION) Due to the temperature situation at door area 1, the floor panels are heated to increase passenger and cabin crew comfort. The system comprises two control units and four heated floor panels (two on each door area 1). Each of the control units controls and monitors the heater assemblies of one side of the door area (two heater elements, one for each of two panels at R/H or L/H door). Each heated floor panel has an electrical heating foil protected with aluminum outer cover plate. In order to minimize heat loss, insulation material is installed to the bottom of the floor panel below the heating foil. The heated floor panel has two drain holes, one on each side, and is shaped to drain away any water that collects on the panel when the door is open.

The control unit maintains a panel surface temperature between 29\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C. For this purpose it compares the temperature recorded by the sensors in the heating circuit to two stored threshold values. If the actual temperature drops below the lower value, the control unit activates the relay to supply the heater circuit with 115V AC. When the upper temperature threshold is exceeded the relay is de-activated interrupting the heater power. If this temperature regulation fails, two over-temperature switches, connected in series interrupt the power circuit protecting the heating elements from damage as follows: - If the temperature exceeds 55\u00b0C the first over-temperature switch opens, thus interrupting the power circuit to the heater. Once the temperature drops below this threshold, the switch closes again and re-activates the heating of the panel. - If the temperature exceeds 70\u00b0C (because the first over-temperature switch had failed) the second one opens cutting the heater power supply irreversibly. The self-locking status switch (in \"open\" position) will only be released after the whole heating system is de-energized. This reset is done automatically. The heated floor panels are supplied with 115V AC from bus bars 212XP and 214XP distributed via control units.

It checks the following items on each of the two heater circuits: - Measuring range of the temperature sensor - Heater elements and connections (open or short) - Temperature sensor and connections (open or short) - Heater current - Heater control circuits - Power supply - Solid-state relays - Interface connections Correct function of these items is indicated by a sum-signal which gives light to two LEDs, one for each heater circuit, installed next either side of the P/B. In case of a detected fault, the related light of the affected heater circuit remains off. This manually initiated BIT is the only way to monitor proper operation of the floor panel heating system. The control units are supplied with 28V DC from bus bar 602PP during the BIT operation. Micro fuses on the front cover of the unit protect the heater circuits.

Two type 3 exits installed over each wing, are always in armed configuration. The opening of one wing exit will start the deployment sequence. The escape slide inflates automatically and is ejected out of its containers and deploys in approximately four seconds. The inflation system is composed of an inflation cylinder, which is installed in the aft cargo compartment. Activation of the release mechanism starts the inflation sequence. The gas stored in the cylinder is discharged to the inflatable through flexible hoses and an aspirator. The aspirator flaps open and ambient air is drawn into the slide. A red manual inflation handle, installed on each exit frame, must be pulled to manually activate the inflation and deployment sequence, in case of automatic release failure. NOTE: In this module the OFFWING ESCAPE SLIDE DEPLOYMENT is described on the A320 but the principle is the same for the A318 and A319.

(A321) (3) DESCRIPTION/DEPLOYMENT The escape slide for the type \"C\" doors, is stored underneath the door inside the fuselage. The inflation cylinder is located in the overhead bin, over the door. The cylinder is in a protection box and can be seen through a plexiglass window. The pressure can be checked on the pressure level indicator. For correct pressure the needle must be in the green section. To initiate the slide deployment, the door must be opened in the armed configuration. To open the door, uncover the control handle, lift the handle fully up, and release it. are located on both sides for assisting people to hold the slide in case it is used not inflated as an evacuation chute. The slide is slightly canted in order to deploy at a safe distance away from the engine. CAUTION: Door opening pneumatically assisted when opened in armed mode. The door opens outwards and then opens quickly. The escape slide in the meantime inflates and deploys completely. The escape slide is ready for use when the door is locked in the fully open position. Should the door open but the escape slide not inflate, a red handle for manual inflation is located in the door upper right hand frame. The transparent protective cover must be taken off and the red handle pulled to initiate the manual slide inflation. The escape slide for the type \"C\" doors is stowed in a special compartment in the fuselage, underneath the door. The deployment sequence starts as soon as the door is opened in armed configuration. One aspirator is connected to the inflation cylinder by means of a flexible hose. During the door opening the inflation cylinder regulator valve is actuated, and primary gas is supplied to the aspirator. The aspirator flaps open and outside air is drawn in. The flaps close as soon as the correct pressure is reached. The slide has a single lane sliding surface with a brake path at the bottom end, which slows down the speed of the evacuees. A lighting system is fitted along both sides and at the bottom of the slide. The lights automatically come on during the slide deployment. They remain on as long as the emergency power supply operates. A re-entry strap is fixed on one side of the slide. A yellow life line is fixed along the outside of the inflation chambers on both sides.

The procedures for compartments located below the right door 3 and the left and right door 2 are almost the same. Make sure that the flaps are retracted. Warning: make sure that the locking pin assembly is correctly installed in the operating head of the inflation reservoir. It prevents an accidental extension of the escape slide. Make sure that the operating striker lever of the door damper and emergency operating cylinder is in the disarmed position. The slide control handle must be in the disarmed position and the safety pin installed. Open the door and make sure that the manual inflation handle is in its correct position. Put the access platform in position at the escape slide stowage compartment. Do a check of the aircraft stowage compartment recess and the stowage compartment attach panel. Make sure that the location pin hole in the attach panel aligns with the location pin on the aircraft stowage compartment recess. The escape slides for the left and the right doors 2 and 3 are not interchangeable. The location pin installed on the aircraft stowage compartment recess prevents incorrect installation. Make a visible inspection of the door lock mechanism on the stowage compartment blowout door. To finish the escape slide installation preparation, remove the blanking plugs. Here you can see the safety tool for slide installation. This tool must be installed on the slide pack and on the stowage compartment recess. Now, tighten the inflation hose and assembly on the fuselage union. Make sure you do not twist the inflation hose when you tighten the end assembly on the fuselage union. This could damage the inflation hose. Install the emergency lighting electrical connector and fix the bonding strap. Put the escape slide stowage compartment in position and remove the safety tool.

The system collects and lets rain water, condensation and spilt liquids flow out of the cargo compartment. The drainage system has filters, filter housings, drain funnels, elbows and flexible hoses. The filter and filter housing are installed on the cargo compartment drain outlets. The filter prevents a blockage of the drain system. The drain funnels are installed beneath the drain outlets. Flexible hoses connect the drain funnels to the elbows. From the elbows, the flexible hoses end at a mutual tee. The flexible hoses are secured in position with straps. OPERATION The rain water, condensation and spilt liquids that may have collected in the cargo compartment, flow out through the drain outlets. From the drain outlets, the liquids move through drain funnels, elbows and flexible houses into the tee. The tee lets the liquid out into the bilge (fuselage lower shell) where the collected liquid is let out of the A/C through drain valves. The drain valves are installed in the fuselage structure near to the lowest points. The drain valves close to prevent loss of cabin pressure (when cabin pressurization reaches 2 psi/0.1378 bar). As the cabin decreases below the preset value (normally after the A/C has landed), the drain valves open under spring tension to allow any water that has collected to drain away.

The system collects and lets rain water and spilt liquids flow out of the cargo compartment. The drainage system has filters, filter housings, drain funnels, elbows and flexible hoses. The filter and filter housing are installed on the cargo compartment drain outlets. The filter prevents a blockage of the drain system. The drain funnels are installed beneath the drain outlets. Flexible hoses connect the drain funnels to the elbows. From the elbows, the flexible hoses end at a mutual tee. The flexible hoses are secured in position with straps. OPERATION The rain water and spilt liquids that may have collected in the cargo compartment, flow out through the drain outlets. From the drain outlets, the liquids move through drain funnels, elbows and flexible houses into the tee. The tee lets the liquid out into the bilge (fuselage lower shell) where the collected liquid is let out of the A/C through drain valves. The drain valves are installed in the fuselage structure near to the lowest points. The drain valves close to prevent loss of cabin pressure (when cabin pressurization reaches 2 psi/0.1378 bar).

They prevent damage to the aircraft structure in case of sudden pressure difference. The system prevents a pressure difference between different areas in the aircraft (cockpit/cabin, or cabin/cargo compartment). The panels have a composite structure made of a honeycomb-core and a flame-retardant laminated-skin. Foam-tape is bonded into the recess of the panel border and makes a seal between the panel and the frame. There is a flame-retardant strip between the Foam-tape and the border edge. The Panel assemblies include a panel, a frame and fastener assemblies. The fastener assemblies are attached to the frames and include some latches, springs and catches. Optionally, protection devices can be installed on the FWD cargo to protect the rapid decompression panels.

ENGINE AND APU FIRE DETECTION The engines and the APU have individual fire detection systems. Each system has two identical detection loops (A and B) installed in parallel. Each loop includes 3 detector elements. The two loops are monitored by a Fire Detection Unit (FDU). FDU 1 monitors the loops on engine 1 and FDU 2 monitors the loops on engine 2. The FDU sends FIRE and FAULT signals to the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) for display on ECAM. ENGINE AND APU FIRE EXTINGUISHING The guarded FIRE P/B switches give FIRE indication and are used to isolate the related systems. When the FIRE pushbutton is released out, the engine or APU will shut down. This also arms the extinguishing system. Each engine has 2 fire bottles installed in the pylon. The discharge of each bottle is controlled by a related AGENT P/BSW. The P/B switches are on the FIRE panel on the overhead panel. For the APU, there is only one fire extinguisher bottle, which is installed in the aft fuselage forward of the APU firewall. Its discharge is controlled by one AGENT P/BSW. On the ground, an APU FIRE will cause an automatic shutdown of the APU and an automatic discharge of the bottle. The TEST buttons are used to do tests on the different fire detection and extinguishing systems and make sure they operate correctly.

The cooling system is controlled and monitored by the Avionics Equipment Ventilation Controller (AEVC). The circulation of the air through the system is supplied by a blower fan (cool air supply) and an extraction fan (warm air removal). The extraction airflow is downstream of the avionics equipment. The avionics SMOKE detector, which is installed in the extraction duct, is used for the detection of smoke from the computers and control boxes. The detector is monitored by the AEVC. The smoke detector directly sends the signal to FWC for the AVIONICS SMOKE warning in the cockpit.

SMOKE DETECTORS The cargo smoke detection system is installed in the FWD and in the AFT/BULK cargo compartments. Four optical smoke detectors are located in two cavities in the ceiling of the AFT/BULK cargo compartment and two additional detectors in the FWD cargo compartment. The cargo smoke detectors are electrically connected to the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) directors via Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 118 of 165 GENERAL & SMOKE DETECTORS Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 119 of 165 CARGO FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) CIDS SMOKE DETECTION FUNCTION BOTTLE For each compartment, the Smoke Detection Function (SDF) integrated in each CIDS director triggers cabin and cockpit warnings. The directors interface with the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), the ventilation system, and the cargo fire extinguishing bottle condition monitoring system. A SMOKE warning is generated when both detectors in a cavity detect smoke ('AND' logic). The CIDS-SDF also monitors the smoke detectors in case of a single detection. When only one cargo smoke detector detects smoke, the CIDS-SDF checks the second detector automatically: - if this test shows a normal operation of the second detector, the first detector is declared faulty. The result is no smoke warning in the cockpit, - if this test shows an abnormal operation of the second detector, the smoke warnings are activated. The second detector is declared faulty. On A320 and A321, one extinguisher bottle is installed in the FWD cargo compartment, on A318 and A319 the bottle is installed in the Bulk cargo compartment. Optionally, on the A320, the extinguisher bottle can be installed in the AFT cargo compartment. The bottle supplies fire extinguishing for the FWD and for the AFT/BULK cargo compartments. The bottle has a pressure switch to monitor agent pressure and two electrically firing cartridges or squibs for agent discharges. The bottle pressure and the two squibs circuit conditions are continuously monitored by the CIDS-SDF. In case of bottle pressure drop or loss of electrical squib continuity, the CIDS-SDF sends signals to the ECAM and CFDS. WARNINGS The CIDS-SDF sends signals for cockpit local warnings, ECAM system and cargo ventilation controller. It also supplies the fault messages to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). In case of FWD or AFT/BULK smoke detection; the respective SMOKE light comes on, on the CARGO SMOKE panel. At the same time the cargo ventilation controller closes the isolation valves of the affected compartment (If ventilation installed). In case of a smoke detector failure, the CIDS-SDF sends signals to the ECAM and CFDS systems. DISCH PUSHBUTTON Action on one of the FWD or AFT guarded DISCHarge P/Bs discharges the bottle in the respective cargo compartment. When smoke is detected, the FWD or AFT DISCH P/BSW has to be pressed, in order to fire the related squib of the extinguishing bottle. Both DISCH lights come on when the fire extinguishing bottle is discharged. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) TEST PUSHBUTTON When the TEST P/B is pressed and held, the CIDS-SDF carries out an automatic test. Smoke and a bottle pressure drop conditions are simulated. The smoke detectors are tested. When the TEST P/B is pressed and held, the SMOKE and DISCH lights on the CARGO SMOKE panel come on twice, and the ECAM warnings are activated. The isolation valves of the cargo compartment ventilation system close and the extraction fan stops. The CIDS also passes the test and in case of a failure of one CIDS-SDF channel the lamps come on only once. When the TEST P/B is released, the DISCH lights and the SMOKE lights go off. The isolation valves of the cargo compartment ventilation system open and the extraction fan starts. The information is stored in the CFDS. On aircraft fitted with CIDS Smoke Detection functions (post mod 33100), spurious smoke warnings can be caused in particular circumstances, which can lead to IFTB or diversion.

The ETOPS panel 22VU controls each of the squib on the two bottles. A priority relay prevents the bottle 2 to be discharged before bottle 1. The TEST pushbutton switch on the overhead panel 22VU, activates the Smoke Detection Function within the Director (CIDS-SDF), starting an automatic test. Smoke and bottle pressure drop conditions are simulated. Indications appear on the cargo smoke panel 22VU as follows: - the FWD and AFT smoke indication lights come on, - the FWD and AFT discharge indication lights come on. The smoke detection function in the CIDS-Director (CIDS-SDF) continuously monitors the bottle pressure condition, the cartridges and the wiring. If faults occur, they show on the ECAM upper display unit. The faults are also transmitted to the Centralized Fault Display (CFDS). The second bottle equally supplies the FWD and AFT cargo compartment discharge nozzles through an ETOPS flow metering system. This ETOPS flow metering system is made of: - a water absorbing filter, - a solid particle filter, - a pressure reducer, - a diaphragm (for flow metering) and non-return valve. The ETOPS flow metering system makes sure that there is a sufficient concentration in the cargo compartment during ETOPS flight diversion. NOTE: the second bottle on ETOPS A/C will be discharged through a flow metering system 60 min. after the first bottle.

The bottle is located above the waste bin. The lavatory fire bottle pressure may be checked at the pressure gage on the bottle. The APU fire bottle is located forward of the APU firewall. Prior to starting the APU, the bottle pressure may be insured by checking the red disc located on the rear fuselage lower left side. The red disc is connected to an overpressure discharge tube. If the bottle pressure becomes excessive, the bottle will discharge to protect the structure and the red disc will blow out. The cargo compartments should be checked for integrity. Any damage to the cargo compartment ceiling or sidewall liner should be repaired immediately. If the compartment is ventilated, the ventilation isolation valves are automatically closed when SMOKE is detected. A hole in the liner could induce airflow through the compartment, compromising the fire protection of the compartments. If the compartment is not ventilated, no airflow is permitted.

A fire test must be performed to verify the integrity of the other loop. The aircraft may not be dispatched with a FIRE DETECTION fault (A and B loops faulty). A single cargo smoke detector fault will be indicated by a STATUS message on ECAM. The aircraft may be dispatched in this condition per the MEL. If both detectors in one cavity are faulty, the aircraft may be dispatched with the compartment empty. The aircraft may be dispatched with the use of the compartments as long as the compartment does not contain inflammable or combustible materials. If the aircraft is equipped with cargo compartment ventilation, the isolation valves must be selected closed. Before each flight, the compartment liner must be checked for condition and integrity. Each lavatory has a single detector. If this detector fails, the aircraft may be dispatched with the lavatory locked closed and the waste bin empty. The lavatory may be used as long as the extinguisher pressure is verified OK and periodic smoke checks are done by the cabin staff. To lock the lavatory, lift the \"LAVATORY\" cover plate on the outside of the door and slide the unlocking pin to the LOCK position.

This test will insure that the APU will be protected in case of a fire. When a fire is detected the APU will shut down and the fire bottle will be discharged automatically. The Auto extinguishing test pushbutton is found on the overhead MAINT panel. The test must be done with the APU shut down but with the master switch selected ON. During the test the APU auto shutdown is simulated and the APU fuel supply valve is closed. Both squibs of each engine fire bottle No. 1 and one squib of the APU fire bottle are supplied by 28 VDC from the HOT bus. When performing maintenance with the FIRE pushbutton released out, make sure to pull both squib C/Bs to protect against bottle discharge. If the C/Bs are not pulled, the bottle may be discharged even without power on the aircraft.

PITCH Two elevators and the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) achieve the pitch control. Elevators are used for short-term activity. The THS is used for long-term activity. ROLL Roll control is achieved by one aileron and spoilers 2 to 5 on each wing, numbered from wing root to wing tip. YAW The rudder does the yaw control. The rudder is used during cross wind take-off and landing, and in case of engine failure (thrust asymmetry). The yaw damper function controls the rudder for Dutch roll damping and turn coordination. SPEED BRAKES The speed brake function is used in flight to increase the aircraft drag. Spoilers 2 to 4 are used. Roll orders and speed brake orders are added with priority given to the roll function. GROUND SPOILERS The ground spoiler function is used to destroy the lift during landing and in case of aborted take-off. All spoiler panels are used. AILERON DROOP The aileron droop function increases the lift on the part of the wing which has no flaps. The ailerons are deflected downwards when the flaps are extended. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 6 of 221 SYSTEM OVERVIEW - PITCH ...

The five lever positions correspond to the surface positions as shown on the graphic. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) HIGH LIFT Slats and flaps achieve the high lift function. There are two flaps, inboard and outboard, and five slats on each wing, numbered from wing root to wing tip. The A321 has double slotted flaps. The slats and flaps are electrically controlled and hydraulically operated. Two Slat Flap Control Computers (SFCCs) do the control and monitoring. Each computer has one slat and one flap channel. The slat and flap systems are similar. A Power Control Unit (PCU) drives each system with two hydraulic motors coupled to a differential gearbox. Torque shafts and gearboxes transmit the mechanical power to the actuators, which drive the surfaces. Each motor is powered by a different hydraulic system and has its own valve block and Pressure Off Brake (POB). Valve blocks control the direction of rotation and the speed of their related PCU output shaft. The POB locks the transmission when the slat and flap surfaces have reached the selected position or if hydraulic power fails. Wing Tip Brakes (WTBs) are given in order to stop and lock the system when major failures are detected. They are hydraulically activated and can only be reset on ground. Position Pick-Off Units (PPUs) send slat and flap position feedback to the SFCCs and ECAM. Flap sensors installed between inboard and outboard flaps inhibit further flap operation when a flap attachment failure is detected. The signal is sent to the SFCCs via the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIU). To prevent an aircraft stall, slats cannot be fully retracted at high angles of attack or low speeds (Alpha/speed lock function). The FLAPS lever has five positions: 0, 1, 2, 3 and FULL. Two configurations correspond to position 1: Configuration 1 and Configuration 1+F. These are selected as shown on the graphic.

It also generate the related artificial feel loads using spring rods, springs and dampers. In autopilot mode, a solenoid is energized in order to keep the side sticks in the neutral position. By doing this, the solenoid provides a higher load level in order to prevent any unwanted switching to the manual control mode, while keeping the possibility to override the autopilot if required. A thermoformed polycarbonate casing houses the mechanical assembly to prevent the penetration of foreign matter, which could jam the moving parts. Two identical transducer units are associated to each computer, one for roll control, another one for pitch control. A transducer unit comprises sets of potentiometers driven by a duplicate mechanism and connected to the EFCS computers via connectors. Ring pins can be installed for adjustment WARNING: During handling, make sure that the side stick assembly stays in vertical position. There is a risk of skydrol leakage from dampers.

They are springloaded to neutral. When the autopilot is engaged, a solenoid-operated detent locks both side sticks in the neutral position. If the pilot applies a force above a given threshold (5daN in pitch, 3.5 daN in roll), the autopilot disengages and the side stick unlocks and sends an input to the computers. The hand grip includes 2 P/Bs: An autopilot disconnect/side stick priority P/B and a push-to-talk button. Side stick priority logic: When only one pilot operates the side stick, his demand is sent to the computers. When the other pilot operates his side stick, in the same or opposite direction, both pilot inputs are algebraically added. The addition is limited to single-stick maximum deflection. NOTE: If one stick is deactivated on ground, at takeoff thrust application, the takeoff \u00abCONFIG\u00bb warning is triggered. NOTE: In the event of simultaneous inputs on both side sticks (2\u00b0 deflection off the neutral position in any direction), the two green SIDE STICK PRIORITY lights, on the glareshield, come on and the \"DUAL INPUT\" voice message activates. A pilot can deactivate the other side stick, and take full control by pressing and keeping pressed his takeover P/B. For latching the priority condition, it is recommended that the takeover P/B be pressed for more than 40 seconds. The takeover pushbutton can then be released without losing priority. However, a deactivated side stick can be reactivated at any time, by momentarily pressing either takeover P/B. If both pilots press their takeover P/Bs, the last pilot to press their P/B will have priority. NOTE: If an autopilot is engaged, any action on a takeover P/B will disengage it. In a priority situation, a red light will come on, in front of the pilot whose side stick is deactivated. A green light will come on, in front of the pilot who has taken control, if the other side stick is not in the neutral position (to indicate a potential and unwanted control demand).

The flight control computers process the demand and send it to the control surfaces. The processing uses pre-set limitations and instructions called LAWS. In normal law, regardless of the pilots' input, the computers will prevent excessive maneuvers and make sure the safe envelope is not exceeded in pitch and roll axes. The rudder control is designed as on a conventional aircraft. Normal law is modified depending on the phase of flight. It operates in 3 modes: - Ground mode: operates on the ground when the aircraft is electrically and hydraulically powered. There is a direct relationship between the side stick and the control surfaces. - Flight mode: operates in the air after a gradual transition from ground mode just after lift-off, - Flare mode: modifies the flight mode to give a conventional \"feel\" to the landing phase. In normal LAW, when the aircraft is in flight mode, the control surface deflection is not directly proportional to the side stick deflection. A side stick deflection gives a rate demand to the flight control computers, which set control surface deflection to meet the rate demand. For the same side stick input, the control surface deflections will be large at low speed and small at high speed. A side stick input is a rate of roll demand in roll and a load factor (g) demand in pitch. Yaw control is conventional. The response information is fed back to the flight control computers. The computers process this feedback and adjust the control surface deflection to ensure that the maneuver rate demand is achieved accurately. This means that control surface deflections may be altered with no change in side stick position. When in flight mode, if you wish to perform a descending left turn for example, you must set the required attitude and then return the side stick Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) to neutral. The neutral side stick position requires zero rates of pitch and roll. The flight control computers will maintain the set attitude until you use the side stick to ask for an attitude change. During the entire maneuver, there is no need for pilot trim inputs. Installation of THS cable cover Prevention of flight control law reversion and loss of flight envelope protections Unexpected water dripping from floor could lead to ice accretion close to rudder and THS cables. This may prevent cables from moving freely through pressure seals and eventually lead to STABILIZER JAM condition associated to reversion in alternate law. SB 27-1286 (for CEO A/C) and SB 27-1287 (for NEO A/C). To avoid blockage of the THS cables leading to the loss of THS mechanical control with THS frozen in position.

They are: - Load factor limitation, - Pitch attitude protection, - High angle of attack protection, - High speed protection. In lateral control, there is only one protection, which is for bank angle. NOTE: Note: Turn co-ordination and \"Dutch roll\" damping are automatically provided in normal law. Pilot inputs on the rudder pedals are not required. LOAD FACTOR LIMITATION Load factor limitation prevents structural overstress by a limitation of the control surface deflections through the flight control computers. Full side stick movement is always available. The load factor is automatically limited to: - (+) 2.5 g to (-) 1 g in clean configuration, - (+) 2 g to 0 g in other configurations.

The pitch attitude protection limits are shown as small green dashes on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). The pitch up values are different depending on the aircraft configuration and speed between 30 and 20 degrees up. The nose down limit is 15 degrees.

This protection takes priority on all others. This protection displays information on the side of the PFD speed scale. Under normal law, when the angle of attack becomes more than PROT, the system changes from normal mode to protection mode: The side sticks controls directly an angle of attack. NOTE: Note: V PROT and V MAX may be different because they are G-load sensitive. When the speed decreases, V PROT reaches VLS, which is the lowest speed that can be selected with the autothrust engaged. A low energy warning, repeated every 5 seconds, indicates to the pilot that the aircraft energy becomes lower than a threshold. Under this threshold, the thrust must be increased to recover a positive flight path angle through pitch control. The low energy warning is available in the following conditions: - Above 100 ft RA and - Below 2,000 ft RA and - In conf 2, 3, FULL and - Not in TOGA, ... With autothrust inoperative or not engaged, the speed can reduce to the first level of AOA protection, V PROT, which is shown at the top of the amber / black band (barber pole). If engaged, the autopilot will disconnect. Nose up pitch trim is inhibited below V PROT. The flight control computers will maintain V PROT if the side stick is released. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD The floor protection is usually available from lift-off down to 100 ft RA. A/THR is automatically activated and commands TOGA thrust when the aircraft angle of attack is above a pre-determined threshold. This is indicated by an \"A FLOOR\" indication on the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) and also on the Engine Warning Display (EWD). If the pilots override V PROT with the side stick, the speed can reduce to V MAX. In normal law, the flight control computers will maintain V MAX, even if a pilot holds a side stick fully aft. In this protection range, the normal law demand is modified and side stick input is an AOA demand, instead of a load factor demand. If the pilot releases the side stick at V MAX, the speed will return to V PROT and will be maintained.

These protection limits are displayed on the PFD speed scale. VMO/MMO is shown at the bottom of the red/black barber pole. Green dashes indicate the speed at which the protection is activated. When the airspeed/Mach increases above VMO/MMO, an overspeed ECAM warning is triggered (refer to Autoflight chapter). If the airspeed/Mach increases to the protection activation speed: - The autopilot disengages and, - The flight control computers send a pitch up command to the control surfaces to prevent more acceleration. The side stick authority is reduced, but the flight control computers will permit this speed to be exceeded momentarily for maneuvering if necessary. With stick released, the speed will return to VMO/MMO.

If the pilot holds full lateral side stick, the angle of bank will increase and maintain 67 degrees. The Flight Director (FD) on the PFD will disappear if the angle of bank exceeds 45 degrees. If the side stick is released at any time when the bank angle exceeds 33 degrees, the aircraft will return to and maintain a 33 degrees bank angle. The FD will be displayed again on the PFD when the angle of bank reduces to less than 40 degrees. The autotrim is inhibited above 33 degrees. With the angle of attack protections active: - The bank angle is limited to 45 degrees and no more. With the high speed protection active: - The system maintains a positive spiral stability to 0 degree bank angle, so that if the side stick is released, the aircraft returns to wing level. The bank angle limit is also reduced from 67 to 40 degrees.

This function decreases the wing structure loads. The LAF becomes active when the vertical load factor becomes more than 1.3 g or less than 0.7g. When this occurs, there is an upward deflection (order calculated by the Elevator Aileron Computers (ELACs)) which is added symmetrically to a possible aileron deflection. The LAF is inhibited when: - Slats or flaps are extended, or - Speed is less than 210 kts, or - In direct law, or - Gradually when the speedbrakes are extended.

Each spoiler is powered by one hydraulic actuator. Surfaces are automatically retracted if a fault is detected by the monitoring system or if there is no electrical supply. In case of loss of hydraulic power supply: - if retracted, the surface remains retracted, - if not retracted, the surface will maintain existing deflection to the zero hinge moment position or less if pushed down by aerodynamics. ELAC There are two ELACs: ELAC 1 normally controls the ailerons, with ELAC 2 as back-up. In case of failure of ELAC 1, ELAC 2 will automatically take control. NOTE: Spoilers 1 are not used for roll control. SEC Using orders coming from the ELACs, each SEC sends orders to one or two pairs of spoilers, without back-up. FAC Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) 1, with FAC 2 as back-up, transmits turn coordination orders for the rudder. FMGC When the autopilot is engaged, the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) sends roll commands to the ELACs and the FACs, and to the SECs through the ELACs via ARINC 429 data buses. AILERONS There are two electrically-controlled hydraulic actuators per aileron, one in active mode and the other in damping mode. The left blue and right green actuators are controlled by ELAC 1 and the other two actuators by ELAC 2. All aileron actuators revert to damping mode in case of a double ELAC failure or green and blue hydraulic low pressure.

This position is shown on the lower display unit of the ECAM. GENERAL The yaw control is done by the rudder, with a maximum deflection of 25\u00b0 for the A320 and A321, and 30\u00b0 for the A318 and A319. The rudder is operated by three moving body servocontrols with a common mechanical input. RUDDER PEDALS The two pairs of rudder pedals are connected together. They are linked by a cable loop to the mechanical summing point which in turn is connected to the hydraulic rudder actuators via a differential unit. Mechanical rudder control is always available from the rudder pedals. The pedal position signals are sent to the ELevator Aileron Computers (ELACs) by the transducer (XDCR) unit. If installed, the Force Transducer Unit (FTU) is used to measure pilots forces applied on the pedals. This information is not used in flight control system but transmitted to the Flight Control Data Concentrator (FCDC) to be recorded by the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR). ELAC In flight, the ELACs transmit the yaw damping and turn coordination to the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) for rudder deflection. There is no feedback to the pedals for yaw damping and turn coordination. FAC The two FACs control the yaw damper servo controls. FAC 1 has priority. FAC 2 is in hot stand-by.

Turn coordination is no longer available. The alternate yaw damper law also becomes active in these cases: - two Air Data References (ADRs) or two Inertial References (IRs) or two ELevator Aileron Computers (ELACs) or both ailerons or all spoilers fail or blue+green hydraulic low pressure or of pitch normal law is lost, - the alternate law in FAC 1 is active with the emergency electrical supply (emergency generator running), - the yaw damper authority is limited to +/- 5\u00b0 rudder deflection. YAW MECHANICAL The mechanical rudder control, which is available at all times, must be used following the failures shown below: - two FACs or three ADRs or three IRs or green+yellow hydraulic low pressure or electrical power on batteries only.

The rudder trim actuator enables the zero force position of the artificial feel and trim unit to be adjusted. CONTROLS The rudder trim actuator is an electromechanical unit, which converts the electrical input from the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) into a rotation of its output shaft. The rudder trim actuator can be controlled either by the RUDder TRIM control switch located in the center pedestal of the cockpit, in manual mode, or by the Flight Management & Guidance Computers (FMGCs) in AP mode. In both cases orders are sent via the FACs. In automatic control, the rudder trim function controlled by the FAC, fulfills the generation and the accomplishment of the engine failure recovery function. In this case, the engine failure compensation slow law orders are sent to the rudder trim actuator. The AP also provides signals, which validate the detection of engine failure as a function of the engine rating. DESCRIPTION/OPERATION The rudder trim actuator has two DC motors, installed on the same shaft. Each one is controlled by one independent electronic module, with only one motor operating at a time, via FAC1 or 2. The motors permanently coupled to a reduction gear, drive the output shaft, via a torque limiter. Then the output shaft drives four Rotary Variable Differential Transducers (RVDTs), transmitting the output shaft position signal to the FACs.

Full input/output lever movement to the rudder servo control is available. VARIABLE LIMITATION Between 160 and 380 kts the rudder deflection is limited as a function of speed. The corresponding law is computed by the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs). HIGH SPEED CONFIGURATION Above 380 kts the stops are in high-speed configuration. Only limited input/output lever movement to the rudder servo control is available. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 72 of 221 LOW SPEED CONFIGURATION ...

The TLU has two brushless electric motors separately controlled by an electronic assembly. Each motor drives two screws via a reduction gear and permits the symmetrical linear displacement of two nuts used as adjustable stops. A non-locking rotary stop limits the stroke of one of the screw/nut assemblies which are irreversible. There are two levers on each connection shaft; one is connected to the input rod and the other is used as a punctual stop. The movement of each screw is transmitted to a Rotary Variable Differential Transducer via the reduction gear which permits to indicate the position of the variable stop. NOTE: Note: To prevent icing, there is a heating system which includes two coils and their regulating thermostats.

In this case, an emergency control brings back the stops to the low speed configuration (maximum possible deflection of the rudder) when slats are extended. NOTE: Note: To bring back the stops to the low speed configuration, the motors are used as 2-phase asynchronous motor energized by 26V 400 Hz power. This control mode is achieved when the coil of a specific relay ( each motor has a relay ) is energized for a period of 30 s approximately. This time is sufficient to bring back the stops to the low speed configuration.

The speed brakes are operated by Spoiler and Elevator Computers (SECs) 1 and 3, and supplied from the hydraulic system. The surfaces used for this function are spoilers 2 thru 4. When one surface is not available on one wing, the symmetrical one, on the other wing, is inhibited. The switching to alternate or direct laws does not have an effect on the speed brake function. The different priorities of this function are: - The roll order has priority over the speed brake function. When the sum of roll and speed brake commands, relative to one surface, is greater than the maximum possible deflection, the symmetrical surface is retracted until the difference between the two surfaces is equal to the roll order. - If the Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) protection is activated with speed brakes extended, the speed brakes are automatically retracted. NOTE: To do the test of the spoiler 1 on the ground, a 6\u00b0 extension of the spoiler 1 is possible with the speedbrake control lever.

When the logic conditions which cause the lift dumper extension are fulfilled, 50 deg deflection orders are sent to the spoilers. The partial lift dumping function is activated when one Main Landing Gear (MLG) is not compressed. Spoilers 1 thru 5 are partially deflected (10 deg) to decrease the lift, help the compression of the second MLG strut, and thus get full ground spoiler extension.

The mechanical trim, which has priority over the electrical trim, is operated from the manual trim wheels. ELAC There are two ELACs. ELAC 2 normally controls the elevators and Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) with ELAC 1 as a backup. In case of ELAC 2 failure, ELAC 1 automatically takes over. SEC In case of dual ELACs failure, SEC 1 or 2 automatically takes over pitch control. FMGC When the Autopilot (AP) is engaged, the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) sends AP commands to the ELACs. ELEVATORS Each elevator is powered by two actuators, one in active mode, and the other in damping mode with automatic changeover in case of failure. Both actuators become active in case of large pitch demands. ELAC 2 controls the green and yellow actuators and ELAC 1 controls the blue actuators. THS The THS is positioned by a screw actuator driven by two hydraulic motors, which are controlled by one of the three electric motors. One electrical trim motor is operative at a time, and the other two are in standby. Motor 1 is controlled by ELAC 2, motor 2 by ELAC 1 or SEC 1, and motor 3 by SEC 2.

IN ELAC WITHOUT PROTECTIONS Depending on the failures, the pitch channel can switch to an alternate law without protections. Alternate law without protection including stability augmentation lost and load factor protection retained, is active in ELAC 1 or 2 in case of either: - 2nd not self-detected ADR failure, - triple ADR failure.

The FWCs elaborate the failure messages on the EWD display. The FWCs receive flight control data from the FCDCs for indication on the ECAM displays. CFDIU/MCDU Data are exchanged between the FCDCs and the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS), which enables two communication modes, normal mode and interactive mode. Normal mode: - the FCDCs send the flight control system failures to the CFDS, - the CFDS adds general data such as time, date, ATA chapter, flight phase, leg, to the failure message on the MCDU display. Interactive mode: the CFDS sends to the FCDCs: - the request for consultation of the BITE inside each computer, - the maintenance test request. The CFDS receives faulty Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) data from the FCDCs which are displayed on the MCDU for trouble-shooting and test purposes.

BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. PCU/SFCC DESCRIPTION This presentation shows the detailed operation of the Power Control Unit (PCU) and the Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC), through a normal extension sequence. As slat and flap system control is identical, only the flap system is shown. Each SFCC flap channel includes 2 lanes and an output module that controls its related valve block. Each valve block includes three solenoid valves. Two of them, called directional valves, command the control valve spool for retraction or extension, while the enable solenoid valve controls the Pressure-Off Brake (POB). The output module has several functions : - collect and analyze the data from lanes 1 and 2, - output data to the related valve blocks.

This signal is processed in flap lanes 1 and 2. The position demand and the actual position from the Feedback Position Pick-off Unit (FPPU) are compared in the SFCC flap lanes. If the requested and actual positions are different, each lane generates command signals that are compared by the output module. If the command signals are in agreement, the output module generates drive commands for PCU valve block activation. Each SFCC channel controls its related solenoid valves. As the extend solenoid is energized, the control valve spool moves from neutral towards the fully deflected position. The direction of valve spool movement controls the direction of rotation of the motor. The degree of valve spool movement controls the rotation speed of the motor. The position of the control valve spool is monitored by a Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT) mounted on one end of the valve block.

With the control valve spool fully deflected, the maximum available fluid flow is directed to the motors, which run at full speed for flap extension.

This causes the spool control valve to move back slowly to the neutral position. The control valve spool movement reduces the fluid flow, which reduces the motor speed.

Asymmetry, runaway, overspeed and uncommanded movement are detected by cross comparison of Asymmetry Position Pick-Off Unit (APPU) and Feedback Position Pick-off Unit (FPPU) signals. If any of these failures are detected by a Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC) and confirmed by the second one, the WTBs are applied. NOTE: Note that if an SFCC does not operate, the other SFCC receives a WTB-arm signal automatically. Thus, if the second SFCC subsequently detects a failure, a solenoid valve on each WTB is energized. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 156 of 221 GENERAL Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 157 of 221 SLATS/FLAPS ABNORMAL LOCKING OPERATION (3) ASYMMETRY Asymmetry is defined as a positional difference between the LH and RH APPUs. Asymmetry is usually due to a broken shaft between both APPUs. The asymmetry threshold is above 5\u00b0 synchro positional difference between both APPUs. RUNAWAY The SFCCs identify a runaway by comparing the LH and RH APPU positions with the FPPU position. The reason for a runaway on slat transmission could be a broken shaft between the slat PCU and the T-gearbox. To avoid that air loads move the slats in a runaway condition, the WTBs will be applied. As LH and RH flap transmissions are directly connected to the Flap PCU only a gearbox failure can cause a runaway. To avoid that air loads move the flaps in a runaway condition, the WTBs will be applied. OVERSPEED An overspeed is detected when the rotation speed of the transmission measured by any Position Pickoff Unit (PPU) is too high.

PPU information is used for system monitoring. If one SFCC detects an asymmetry, its associated valve block is de-energized. A \"WTB arm\" signal is sent to the other SFCC flap channel to check whether asymmetry is confirmed, or not. If the other SFCC confirms the asymmetry, the WTB solenoid is energized, PCUs are de-energized and the flap drive system is stopped. A reset of the WTBs can be done on ground only via the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). If asymmetry is only detected by one computer, the associated flap drive system is considered faulty.

As slat and flap operations are identical, only flaps operation will be shown. When half speed is detected, a level 1 caution is generated and a fault message is displayed on the EWD. The STS page appears after the pilot confirms the Flap fault by pressing the CLEAR button on the ECAM control panel or calls the STS by pressing STS button on the ECP. A green message SLAT/FLAP SLOW is displayed on the SD. NOTE: the STS message \" SLAT/FLAP SLOW\" will only appear if both Engines are running. On ground with engines off ,no Slat / Flaps STS message will appear.

Each flap channel lane of SFCC 1 generates command signals. The drive commands, generated in SFCC1 Output module, control the related solenoid valve in the flap PCU. Only the related green hydraulic motor is operative. As the yellow valve block is not energized, the Pressure-Off Brake (POB) holds the output shaft of the yellow hydraulic motor. Due to the differential gearbox, the system moves with full torque at half speed.

Signals from the Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT) are used to compare the position of the control valve with the drive command orders. In this example, a green hydraulic low pressure is detected by SFCC1. As soon as the hydraulic pressure drop is detected, the PCU valve block solenoids are de-energized. The POB holds the output shaft of the green hydraulic motor. Only the yellow valve block is energized, so only the yellow hydraulic motor is operative. Due to the differential gearbox, the system moves with full torque at half speed. As the green hydraulic system also supplies one slat PCU motor, the slat system is affected as well.

PCU The PCU incorporates two hydraulic motors, each controlled by an electrically signaled valve block. The slat PCU drives the slat transmission system via a single output shaft. TORQUE SHAFTS The rotation of the torque shafts drives all gearboxes and rotary actuator input shafts simultaneously and at the same speed. Steady bearings, attached to the structure, support the torque shafts where small angular changes of alignment occur. GEARBOXES Six gearboxes are used in the slat transmission system where changes in torque shaft alignment occur: - one 19-degree bevel gearbox changes alignment under the wing center box, - one T-gearbox changes alignment through 90 degrees in each wing, - two 63.5-degree bevel gearboxes take drive from below each wing level into the wing leading edge. ACTUATORS The actuators produce the torque and speed reduction necessary to drive the slats at the required rate. Each actuator drives its associated slat track through a pinion driven by the actuator output shaft.

Slat 1 is supported by four tracks, but only T2 and T3 are driven. T1 and T4 prevent slat loss in case of attachment failure. Slats outboard of the pylon are supported by two driven tracks. TORQUE LIMITERS Each actuator incorporates a bi-directional torque limiter which protects the structure from overload. WTB The Wing Tip Brakes (WTBs) stop and hold the transmission if the Slat Flap Control Computers (SFCCs) detect abnormal operation such as asymmetry and runaway. Once applied, the WTBs can only be reset on the ground by maintenance action via the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). APPU The Asymmetry Position Pick Off Units (APPUs) enable the SFCC to monitor the system for asymmetry and runaway conditions. One APPU is mounted outboard of track 12 in each wing. It gives the slat actual position to the SFCC. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 172 of 221 TRACKS - TORQUE LIMITERS ...

The flap disconnect sensors, which are proximity sensors, detect any flap disconnection. LGCIU Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) receives signals from two sensors and transmits this data to its related Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC). The LGCIUs are used to process signals from proximity sensors. SFCC The SFCCs monitor the flap-attachment failure detection sensors to find connection failure. If the SFCCs receive a flap disconnect signal: - the valve block solenoids on the Power Control Unit (PCU) are de-energized, - the Pressure-Off Brakes (POBs) lock the two hydraulic motors, - the SFCCs give a class 1 level 2 caution and the ECAM display unit shows a failure message. System reset is only possible on the ground. The ECAM display unit shows a failure message if: - the SFCC gets different data from the two sensors on the same wing or, - one sensor gives incorrect data.

Indeed, message gives precise information on the possible root causes. TSM task related to the fault message has to be followed. Follow step by step the TSM related to the failure messages: Taking into account previous action done (i.e. LRU removal), if issue is still there on A/C, do the following step proposed by the TSM. Send Trouble Shooting data with removed LRU to ease repair in shop : Repair shop can do dedicated tests or actions (e.g. relay replacement) if the PFR, test result and / or trouble shooting data, if available, are given. Intermittent faults must follow a trouble shooting as per TSM : Intermittent fault = repetitive fault experienced in flight and not confirmed on ground. - After three occurrences of the same phenomenon (even if the ground test is still OK), the other steps of the TSM procedure must be followed. - While doing the wiring inspection, it is advised to check the wires to help reproducing the issue on ground. Do the follow-up of A/C & remove the LRU, to confirm the failure origin and identify potential rogue units: This lets : - either explain No Fault Found (NFF), if the issue is still shown on A/C. - or to confirm the failure origin (Fault Found (FF) in accordance with removal cause). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD - or to identify potential rogue Units, if the issue is no more on A/C despite NFF LRU. Removed LRU can be put in quarantine pending the end of Trouble Shooting: This applies for intermittent trouble shooting issues and: - give updated and complete information to the repair shop. - avoid installation of a unit with intermittent failure on a new A/C. - get easier LRU follow-up. Use Thales Chronic unit policy (send units suspected as chronics to Thales) : As per Thales policy, chronic unit policy (deep investigations) applies to computers: - removed 3 times within 18 months. - Whatever the reason of removal. - FF or NFF.

This tool lets either confirm a servocontrol failure or direct on other possible causes, which are wiring or computer issue. It can be used in case of an \"ELEVATOR SERVO FAULT\" or \"ELAC PITCH FAULT\" warning message experienced. In this procedure, the operator can interchange the wiring between two servocontrols (the one supposed unserviceable and one known as serviceable). Let there be \"X\" as ELAC & SEC computers (E1, S1 or E2, S2) and related servocontrol. Without the swapping tool (normal wiring), computers \"A\" control the elevator Servocontrol \"A\" and computers \"B\" control the elevator Servocontrol \"B\". When the swapping tool is used, computers \"A\" control the elevator Servocontrol \"B\" and computers \"B\" control the elevator Servocontrol \"A\". Two wiring mode can be used to connect the servocontrols : - Adjacent servocontrol wiring. - Opposite servocontrol wiring.

The fuel tanks are in the center fuselage area and the wings. The center tank is a part of the center wing box. The wing tanks are divided into inner cells and outer cells. To have less structural load on the wings, the fuel in the outer cells is not used until the fuel load in the inner cells decreases to a low level. Two fuel pumps are installed in the center tank and two other fuel pumps are installed in each wing tank inner cell. Fuel is supplied to the engines from the center tank first. When the center tank is empty, fuel is supplied from the wing inner cells. There is no direct feed from the outer cells to the engines. Two inter cell transfer valves are used to transfer fuel from the outer cells to the inner cells when the fuel quantity gets to the low level. Two engine Low Pressure (LP) valves are installed to stop the fuel supply to the engines. The LP valve is closed when its related engine stops or when the FIRE pushbutton is released. A cross feed valve is used to connect or isolate the left and right sides. With this valve, fuel can be supplied to one engine or the other from all available fuel pumps. On the ground, the cross feed valve is used to transfer fuel from tank to tank. The fuel system also supplies fuel to the APU directly from the left side. The APU LP valve is installed to stop the fuel supply to the APU. It closes when the APU stops or when the APU FIRE pushbutton is released.

Like the A318/A319/A320, the center tank is part of the center wing box but with the difference that the wing tanks are not divided. The tanks are simply known as left and right wing tanks. Two fuel pumps are installed in each wing tank. Fuel is supplied to the engines from the wing tanks only. While the fuel level in the wing decreases, the center tank fuel is transferred to the wing tanks until the center tank is empty. Transfer valves control the fuel transfer from the center tank to the wing tanks. The transfer valves supply pressure for two jet pumps. These pumps are installed in the center tank and they transfer the fuel from the center tank to the wing tanks. Two engine Low Pressure (LP) valves are installed to stop the fuel supply to the engines. The LP valve is closed when its related engine stops or when the FIRE pushbutton is released. A cross feed valve is used to connect or isolate the left and right sides. With this valve, fuel can be supplied to one engine or the other from all available fuel pumps. On the ground, the cross feed valve is used to transfer fuel from tank to tank. The fuel system also supplies fuel to the APU directly from the left side.

Overpressure protectors are installed in the system to relieve pressure in the tanks that might occur through vent blockage or a pressure refueling gallery failure. An excess pressure in the outer cell relieves fuel into the inner cell via an overpressure protector mounted on rib 15. An excess pressure in the inner cell or in the vent surge tank relieves fuel overboard via an overpressure protector installed on a tank access panel. The center tank overpressure protector relieves fuel into the left inner cell. VENT SURGE TANK Each vent surge tank vents to the atmosphere through a NACA type intake connected with a vent duct. Inside the vent duct there is a vent protector and a flame arrestor. The function of the vent protector is to prevent clogging of the vent duct by ice formation. The flame arrestor reduces the risk of a ground fire igniting the fuel tanks. Fuel spilled through the vent pipes into the surge tank is induced back into the outer cell by a scavenge jet pump using motive power from the wing fuel pumps. Be careful when you do work near the left-wing surge tank, there is a possible risk of asphyxiation if you put your head through the opening of the NACA duct access panel. WING TANK VENTING SYSTEM VENT FLOAT VALVES Two vent float valves prevent fuel from passing in the vent lines during A/C bank maneuvers. The open ends of the ducts and the vent float valves, which permit air to vent but not fuel, are positioned at the optimum levels for refueling and normal ground/flight maneuvers. A vent float valve fitted to the outer side of sealed rib 15 permits air to be vented from the outer cell to the inner cell during flight maneuvers. Each wing tank inner and outer cell vents to the related vent surge tank. The vent lines are fitted with a vent float valve. The ducts are large enough to make sure that if the pressure refueling shut-off fails, excess fuel will be discharged overboard through the NACA intake. A rubber check valve installed in the vent line allows any fuel that finds its way into the vent lines to drain back into the related tank, where it is installed. CENTER TANK VENTING SYSTEM The center tank vents into the LH vent surge tank. The center tank vent line is a conventional open line, provided with a check valve and large enough for airflow. In case of overfueling of the center tank most of the fuel flows over to the right wing tank through the relief valve. Be careful when you do work near the center tank, there is a possible risk of asphyxiation if you put your head through the opening of the tank access panels.

Pressurized air from around the mixer unit AFT of the FWD cargo flows through the space between the vapor seal and the tank bottom to ventilate it. DRAIN MAST A system of drains at the rear of the vapor seal conveys drainage and ventilating (exhaust) air through a drain mast to atmosphere. The drain mast is an aluminum fairing bolted to the underside of the fuselage. Such drain mast also receives the possible fuel leakage from the shrouded APU fuel supply line LEAK MONITOR In the event of fuel flowing from the drain mast, check the leak monitor to determine the area of leakage: center tank or APU fuel supply line.

GENERAL The main fuel pump system supplies fuel from the fuel tanks to the engines. Each tank has two centrifugal booster pumps. CROSSFEED VALVE The crossfeed valve divides the engine fuel feed system into two independent systems. The valve is located in the center tank and is usually in the closed position. In this position, it divides the main fuel pump system into two parts, one part for each engine. When the crossfeed valve is open, either tank can supply fuel to either engine. The valve is electrically controlled and operated by two DC motors. MAIN FUEL PUMPS The main pumps are driven by a 3-phase 115V AC motor. The two pumps in each tank are supplied by different electrical power supply bus bars. When it is in operation, each main pump may supply fuel to: - its related engine, - the fuel recirculation cooling system, - the crossfeed system, - the refuel/defuel system. FUEL PUMP CANISTER The canister lets you replace the fuel pump without draining fuel. The fuel pump element is located in a canister attached to the bottom skin of the wing or the centre wing box, with an inlet connected to a fuel strainer. The canister has different outlets: - one upper outlet is connected to the engine feed line and contains an internal flap-type check valve, - the other upper outlet is connected to a sequence valve (for wing tank pumps only), Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 26 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL - CROSSFEED VALVE ...

When a fuel pump is not in operation, the check valves prevent any reverse flow of fuel through the pump. The center fuel pump element is located in a canister attached to the center tank bottom skin, with a lower inlet connected to a fuel strainer. AIR RELEASE VALVE The air release valve releases air, trapped in the engine fuel feed line, into the wing tank. The air release valve is installed at the highest point between the pump and the LP fuel valve.

Each LP fuel valve has an actuator with 2 electric motors. Each one of them is supplied by different 28 V DC power sources. The LP fuel valve isolates the engine fuel feed supply at engine shutdown, i.e. normal procedure, or in case of emergency, i.e. engine fire procedure.

The jet pump body has a flange at one end for the installation to the tank structure. The jet pump body has also three threaded openings: Z is the outlet form the jet pump Y is the inlet from the fuel tank X is the inlet from the related fuel pump The jet adaptor assembly has: a non-return valve (NRV) a jet nozzle The NRV has a spring and a valve assembly. If the related pump is set to off, the spring closes the NRV. Thus fuel cannot enter the fuel pump that is set to off. OPERATION When the related fuel pump is on, fuel goes into the jet pump through the inlet X. The fuel flows through the NRV and the jet nozzle. The jet nozzle decreases the pressure and increases the velocity of the fuel that goes through. This causes a suction force at the inlet Y that is connected to a pipe system and therefore connected to the lowest part of the tank. The fuel at the inlet Y is moved through the jet pump, mixed with the fuel from the inlet X and distributed through the outlet Z.

If the pressure from the center tank pump decreases to less than 6 psi (0.41 bars) the pressure switch sends a warning signal to the ECAM system. Fuel is first supplied by the center tank pumps and then by the wing tank pumps when the center tank is empty. Center tank scavenge jet pumps move fuel and water caught in the tank to the related main pump inlet.

The wing tank pumps have a sequence valve to make sure that the center tank is emptied first. The sequence valve acts as a relief valve and keeps the output pressure of a wing tank pump 5 psi lower than that of the center tank pump. The pumps in each wing tank are located in the lowest area of the inner cell in a collector cell. Seven clack valves at the bottom of rib 2 allow the fuel to flow into the collector cell but prevent the fuel from flowing back during wing down manoeuvres of the aircraft. Thereby the fuel pumps are sufficiently immersed in fuel even if the fuel level in the tank is low. Each wing tank collector cell has: - two fuel pumps contained in their related canisters, - two fuel strainers, - a suction valve, - two check valves.

If the pressure from the main pump decreases to less than 6 psi (0.41 bars) the pressure switch sends a warning signal to the ECAM system. BYPASS SUCTION VALVE A bypass suction valve is installed on the engine feed line, downstream of the main pumps. If both wing tank pumps fail with no center tank pump running and the crossfeed valve closed, the bypass suction valve lets fuel be sucked from the wing tank by the engine fuel pump system and thus engine supply is done by \"gravity\".

A Check valve, in the line between the vent surge tank, combined with this jet pump, makes sure that fuel cannot enter the vent surge tank via the pump if the wing tank pumps are off. The other scavenge jet pump mixes fuel and water within the outer cell. Each scavenge jet pump receives its motive fuel pressure from the wing tank pumps, if running.

Each valve is operated by an electrical motor. The intercell transfer valve motor is attached at the rear or front wing spar while the valve body is inside the tank at Rib 15. The connection between the motor and the valve body is achieved through a rotating shaft. When controlled to open the valves are latched open and close again on ground during next refueling operation or electrical power up of the fuel system.

The control is done through the Refuel / Defuel control panel in the belly fairing. The valve can only be controlled to open on ground. When open, the valve interconnects the right hand engine supply line with the Refuel Gallery and allows fuel transfers and defueling operations. The crossfeed valve needs to be controlled to open from the cockpit overhead panel, if a connection to the left hand engine supply line is necessary.

BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. PRINCIPLE The temperature of the Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil is decreased by fuel through a recirculation system. Some of the fuel that supplies the engines is used to decrease the temperature of the IDG oil. A Fuel Return Valve (FRV) lets the hot fuel return to the outer cell. The FRV opens at low engine fuel flow if the engine oil temperature is more than 90\u00b0C (199\u00b0F). The return valve mixes the hot fuel with cold fuel from the Low Pressure (LP) fuel pump to keep the temperature of the returned fuel less than 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F). The Fuel Level Sensing Control Unit (FLSCU) 1 and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) 1 control the recirculation system in the left wing. FLSCU 2 and ECU 2 control the right wing system.

The pressure-holding valve keeps a pressure of 15.5 psi in the return line. If the pressure increases, fuel bleeds through the valve into the outer cell. The check valve prevents fuel flow from the wing tank to the engine when the recirculation system is not in operation. NOTE: Note: When the outer cell is full, the fuel overflows into the inner cell through a spill pipe.

If this occurs, the center tank pump stops when the inner cell gets to the FULL level sensor. The wing tank pumps will supply the fuel to the engine until approximately 500 kg (1100 lbs) of fuel are used and the UNDERFULL sensor is reached. The logic circuit then starts the center tank pump again.

This causes the wing tank to overflow through the tank ventilation system into the vent surge tank. The overflow sensor sends an electrical signal to the FLSCU. The FLSCU sends a closure signal to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The ECU closes the FRV and stops the fuel supply back to the outer cell.

Because the returned fuel from the engine is hot, the FLSCU prevents an overtemperature in the wing tanks. The FLSCU sends a closure signal to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The ECU closes the FRV and stops the fuel supply back to the outer cell.

GENERAL VALVE OPEN The APU fuel supply system comprises a fuel pump, a Low Pressure (LP) fuel valve and an actuator on the rear wall of the center tank. The fuel supply to the APU is normally from the Left Hand (LH) crossfeed line. The APU LP fuel shut-off system has a LP fuel valve that controls the supply of fuel to the APU. If an APU fire occurs on ground, the APU emergency shutdown system closes the LP fuel valve to stop the flow of fuel. When the crossfeed valve is open, either engine feed line, left or right, can supply fuel to the APU. The valve opens when: - the APU MASTER SWitch is set to ON, - the FUEL VENTilation P/BSW in the APU compartment is pressed and held. The FUEL VENT P/BSW is used to purge the system during ground maintenance. VALVE CLOSE APU PUMP The valve closes when: - the ECB powers down after APU shutdown, - the FUEL VENT P/BSW is released, - the APU FIRE P/BSW on the overhead panel released out , - the APU FIRE SHUT-OFF switch on the panel FWD of the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) bay is operated, - the fire detection system operates on the ground (APU Emergency Shutdown and APU Auto extinguishing function). The fuel pressure for the APU comes either from the APU fuel pump or the engine fuel pumps. For normal operation, the essential bus bar 801XP (115V AC) supplies the pump motor. When the bus bar is not energized, the static inverter bus bar 901XP (115V AC) supplies the pump motor. CANISTERS The canister permits pump replacement even with fuel in the tanks or in the APU fuel line. When a pump is removed, the fuel pressure closes the canister inlet and outlet. PRESSURE SWITCH The pressure switch controls pump operation. The pressure in the left crossfeed line operates a micro switch. The APU fuel pump stops if the crossfeed line pressure reaches 23.3 psi absolute (1.6 bar) and restarts at 21.7 psi (1.5 bar). APU LP SHUT-OFF VALVE FUEL VENT P/B When the A/C is on ground, it is possible to operate the APU fuel pump (single phase 115VAC) to purge the fuel line. The FUEL VENT P/BSW on frame (FR) 80 in the APU compartment is used to operate the pump and to open the LP fuel valve. APU MASTER SWITCH If the APU MASTER SW P/BSW is pressed ON, the APU pump will operate if the pump inlet pressure is below 21.7 psi (1.5 bar) absolute. This is initiated automatically through the pressure switch. The APU LP fuel shut-off valve is used to isolate the APU fuel supply line from the left engine feed line, when the APU does not operate.

When the TEST switch is set to the HI LVL position, the HI LVL lights come on if the high level sensors and their circuits are serviceable. A filament test is done when the TEST switch is set to LighTS. All the panel lights come on and all quantity indications show 8s. HIGH LEVEL LIGHTS A blue HIgh LeVeL light for each tank comes on when the associated high level sensor is covered. The related refuel valve will close. PRESELECTED REFUEL VALVE SELECTOR When automatic refueling, the fuel quantity taken aboard is governed by the setting on the PRESELECTED display. There is one refuel valve selector per tank. For an automatic refueling, these refuel valves selectors remain in the NORMal position. For the defueling, the valves will not open. When the selector is set to OPEN, the refuel valve operation depends on the MODE SELECTor position. With the MODE SELECT in the REFUEL position, each refuel valve closes when the associated high level is reached. When the REFUEL VALVES selector is set to the SHUT position, the refuel valve is closed. This is independent of the MODE SELECT position. ACTUAL MODE SELECTOR The ACTUAL total quantity indication shows the amount of fuel on board. ROCKER SWITCH The desired fuel figure of the pre-selector is obtained by tripping the rocker switch to decrease or increase. END LIGHT With the MODE SELECT at OFF, the refuel valves are closed. When the MODE SELECT is set to REFUEL, the refuel valves operate automatically or manually depending on the position of the refuel valve selectors. For defueling or transfer of fuel the MODE SELECT is set to DEFUEL/XFR. It opens the defuel/transfer valve. The green END light comes on when automatic refueling is complete.

OPTIONAL FUEL QUANTITY PRESELECTOR IN FLIGHT COMPARTMENT Optionally, the refueling operation can also be controlled from the cockpit via the cockpit refuel/defuel control panel. From this preselector, the aircrew can set the required quantity of fuel and initiate automatic refueling operation. This cancels any fuel quantity set on the belly fairing refuel/defuel control panel. When the required fuel quantity is set on the cockpit preselector, the ready for refueling light, located on the RH wing adjacent to the refuel coupling, comes on. When the PoWeR P/BSW is pushed, the ON light comes on, and the refueling circuits are energized. The white CocKPiT light also comes on, on the preselector panel in the cockpit and on the external refuel/defuel control panel. When the high level sensors fail, refueling is stopped and the FAULT light on the PWR P/BSW comes on. The refuel valves switches on the belly fairing refuel/defuel control panel are in the NORM position and the PWR P/BSW pushed. When the ConTroL momentary action P/BSW is pushed, the ON light comes on, and refueling is controlled from the cockpit preselector. There is no need to operate the external refuel/defuel control panel. If the refuel valves switches are not in the NORM position on the belly fairing refuel/defuel control panel, the VALVE amber light comes on.

The refuel gallery is a fuel line that connects all the refuel valves together. The refuel/defuel system controls the fuel flow into or out of the A/C. Automatic refueling, manual refuel, defuel or ground transfer are controlled from the refuel/defuel control panel, installed on the belly fairing. A refuel/defuel coupling, also installed in the leading edge of the wing, is the interface between the refuel/defuel system and the external fuel source. Wing tank gravity refueling is possible. To fill the fuel tanks to their maximum capacity, the A/C must be level. During an automatic refueling, the refueling of each fuel tank is controlled by the FQI computer. The main fuel pumps are used to defuel the A/C. The defuel/transfer valve and the crossfeed valve must be open. SPILL PIPES DIFFUSERS The diffusers, installed on refuel lines, diffuse fuel into the tanks with minimum turbulence and electrostatic build-up. AIR INLET AND DRAIN VALVES REFUEL/DEFUEL CONTROL PANEL The primary components on the refuel/defuel control panel are: - the control panel, - the fuel quantity PreSELector, - the fuel quantity indicator. When the quick release door of the refuel/defuel control panel is opened, it operates a micro switch, which sends a signal to the FQI computer and connects the 28V DC supply to the refuel/defuel electrical circuits. REFUEL/DEFUEL COUPLING The air inlet valve lets air into the refuel gallery after refueling. Thus fuel can drain from the refuel gallery through the fuel drain valve. A pipe extends from the air inlet valve to the outboard side of rib 21. This pipe makes sure that the air inlet remains above the fuel level at all times. This stops the movement of fuel from one wing tank to another by gravity. The fuel drain valves are closed by fuel pressure in the refuel gallery. When the pressure source is removed, the valve opens to allow fuel to drain from the refuel gallery into the wing tank. DEFUEL/TRANSFER VALVE The refuel/defuel coupling supplies the wing tanks and the center tank. When not in use, the coupling is fitted with a pressure-blanking cap. The refuel/defuel coupling has a standard 2.5 inch adaptor flange. The coupling ring has a breakaway groove around its circumference. This prevents damage to the A/C structure if a sideways force is applied. The defuel/transfer valve connects the main fuel pump system to the refuel gallery. When open, the valve permits the fuel in the main fuel pump system to be moved into the refuel gallery. The valve is controlled by the MODE SELECT toggle switch on the refuel/defuel control panel. PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE REFUEL VALVE AND REFUEL GALLERY Each refuel valve, one per tank, is the interface between the refuel gallery and the related fuel tank. The valve is controlled by a solenoid which, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) During a refuel operation, the outer cell is filled first. When it is full, fuel flows into the inner cell through the spill pipe which connects the two cells together. The pressure relief valve releases fuel into the RH wing tank if a center tank overflow occurs. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 100 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY HIGH LEVEL SENSOR One high level sensor is installed in each tank. When the high level sensor is immersed in fuel, the Fuel Level Sensing Control Unit (FLSCU) receives this state, amplifies this signal to control the refuel valve to close. OVERWING REFUELING POINTS (OPTIONAL) As an option, each wing tank has an overwing refuel point installed in the upper wing surface, to refuel the A/C when a pressure refuel source is not available. During an overwing refuel, the fuel only goes into the wing tank. It is then necessary to do a fuel transfer to get the fuel into the correct fuel-load configuration.

The system mainly gives: - fuel mass/temperature measurement and display, - control of automatic aircraft refueling, - system integrity monitoring using BITE, - ARINC 429 digital data for interface to other systems. FQIC The Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC) does the fuel mass calculations and controls the whole system by using various interfaces. The FQIC has two identical channels. Each channel calculates the tank quantities and monitors the status of the other channel. The healthiest channel is in control. If one channel fails, the system operates normally, but the ECAM will indicate a failure warning on the upper Display Unit (DU) as well as the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) report will indicate the failure. PROBES A set of capacitance probes in each tank sends a signal to the computer in relation to the fuel level in the tank. There are 5 probes in the center tank and 14 per wing tank. 2 probes are inside the optional Additional Center Tank. A single probe failure does not affect the system indication. In each tank inner cell, fuel probe No. 2 and in each outer cell fuel probe No. 13 have diodes that give the fuel temperature to the FQIC for indication on the ECAM system display. CAPACITANCE INDEX COMPENSATOR One probe with a Capacitance Index Compensator (CIC) is installed inside each tank such that under normal operational conditions it is always Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) fully submerged in fuel and thus the permittivity of the fuel can be determined. The Capacitance Index Compensator has a capacitance in proportion to the dielectric constant of the fuel. The capacitance value is a result of the density of the fuel between the plates. The fuel density changes with temperature and type of fuel. In the case of cadensicons failure, the fuel mass can be calculated from a density value as assumed from the dielectric constant value. This standard dielectric constant value depends on the type of fuel and fuel temperature. CADENSICONS The cadensicons give a signal to the computer in proportion to the density and the dielectric constant of the fuel held in each tank. The fuel mass is calculated from this density value. FLSCU The Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCU) are mainly used: - to shut the related refuel valve when the high level is reached in each tank, - to start the BITE test of the high level sensors and their related circuits, by using the TEST switch on the refuel/defuel control panel. High-level sensors in each tank send a signal to the FQIC, via the FLSCU. The test is started via the FQIC and the FLSCU. Sensor and system status is sent from the FQIC to the CFDS. REFUEL/DEFUEL CONTROL PANEL The FQIC sends automatic shut-off indication at a preselected refuel quantity. When the MODE SELECT switch on the refuel/defuel control panel has been set to the REFUEL position, the FQIC first makes sure that it is physically possible to transfer the preselected fuel quantity from tank to tank.Throughout the automatic refuel operation the FQIC monitors the density of fuel in each tank and the distribution of the load. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 112 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY MTI FMGC A Multi Tank Indicator (MTI) displays the fuel quantity in each tank. Fuel parameters are sent to the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs), for navigation computations. FWC ECAM The FWC sends the audible warning and the MASTER CAUT light comes on. Total and individual tank fuel mass information is sent to the ECAM for display. PRESELECTOR The pre-selector shows the pre-selected and actual total fuel quantities, as monitored by the computer. LGCIU 1 The FQIC receives the left and right L/G compressed information from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1. L/G CONTROL LEVER The FQIC receives ground information from the L/G when selected DOWN with the aircraft on jacks. This signal is used to supply electrical power to the FQIC in this specific configuration. ADIRS Acceleration data is received from the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) during flight and is used as an alternate source of attitude. Normally, effects of attitude, changes in acceleration, effective pitch and roll angles, are calculated from the height of fuel at each probe and the knowledge of the tank geometry stored in the computer memory. CFDS ARINC 429 output links transmit BITE information from the computer to the CFDS. The CFDS monitors fault conditions and BITE.

The signals have a continuous 30 seconds time average applied to remove fluctuations. If the cadensicon signal is not available or invalid (all failed or out of range in water) the Capacitance Index Capacitor (CIC) signal is used. One probe has a CIC at its lower end. The CIC has a specific function: - to measure the dielectric constant, because most of the time it is fully covered by remaining fuel in tank. The FQIC uses the dielectric constant to calculate the fuel volume in the tanks. The electrical capacitance of each probe is proportional to the height of fuel around the probe. One CIC probe is positioned in the tank (always fully submerged in fuel under normal operational conditions) measuring the permittivity of the fuel (K, also called the dielectric). A separate component called Cadensicon (on A318, A319 & A320) or, Ultracomp and Dualcomp (on the A321) is used to measure the density of the fuel. With fuel height and permittivity data, the volume of fuel in the tank (cell) is determined. When combined with the fuel density information the mass of fuel is calculated by the FQIC. NOTE: The ECAM displays the Fuel on Board (FOB) with two amber dashes as a degraded display, as long as the accuracy is not degraded beyond 5%. NOTE: Non-constant temperature basically changes the Density and Permittivity. In normal operation the FQIC calculates the mass of fuel with an accuracy of 1%. In back-up operation, if density information is lost, once the volume of fuel in the tank (cell) is determined, the fuel density is assumed from the Dielectric characteristic (K) as per the chart. The \"Block FUEL\" is calculated by the FQIC, but with a reduced accuracy (less than 3% to 4%).

B2 SCOPE FULL LEVEL CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. A center tank pump will stop when the two FULL LVL sensors in the related wing tank are wet. The pump will not operate again until at least one UNDERFULL LVL sensor in the related wing tank is dry. The related center tank LOW LVL sensor must also be wet for the pump to restart. GENERAL The aircraft is equipped with two multi-channel Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCU) and a third one, if the Additional Center Tank (ACT) is installed. They provide high fuel level sensing, low fuel level sensing, full fuel level sensing, underfull fuel level sensing, overflow level and temperature sensing. Fuel level and temperature sensors feed signals to the multi-channel amplifiers. The FLSCU detect and amplify the signals and trigger switching functions in the appropriate circuits. HIGH LEVEL The FLSCUs use signal conditioning to independently monitor the high level sensors. When the high level sensor in the fuel tank becomes wet, the FLSCUs will give a output to: -close the related refuel valve -cause the related HI LVL light to come on at the refuel panel LOW LEVEL A signal is given to the time delay relays when a center tank LOW LVL sensor becomes dry. When the LOW LVL sensor has been dry for five minutes, the related center tank pump is latched off. 3 low level sensors at a fuel level of 750 Kg (1653 lbs) in each wing tank are used for: - opening of the Intercell Transfer Valves simultaneously in both wing tanks when exposed to air the first time. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) UNDERFULL LEVEL The full and underfull level sensors are installed in the wing tanks. The FLSCU use the full and the underfull level sensor data to control the automatic operation of the center tank fuel pumps. This controls the wing tank fuel level. Data from the full level sensor is used to make sure the fuel level (in the wing tank) does not increase above the full mark. Data from the underfull level sensor is used to make sure that the fuel level (in the wing tank) does not decrease to less than 500 kg (1100 lb) below the full mark (with fuel in the center tank). OVERFLOW LEVEL If the center tank pump fails to stop with inner cell full level reached, the overflow sensor sends a signal, via the FLSCU, to the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) to close the Fuel Return Valve (FRV). TEMPERATURE SENSOR The fuel temperature sensor in the wing tank inner cell sends a high fuel signal temperature signal 52.5\u00b0C (126.5\u00b0F). The fuel temperature sensor in the wing tank outer cell sends a high fuel signal temperature signal 55\u00b0C (131.0\u00b0F).

When the fuel level in one wing has decreased by 200 kg, and has therefore reached the underfull level, the center tank transfer valve is controlled to open, and is displayed green, in line on the ECAM. Fuel is transferred from the center tank to the wing tank. When the full level is reached, the transfer valve is controlled to close, and is displayed green, cross line on the ECAM. NOTE: This sequence can be initiated on ground depending upon the fuel level. The transfer sequence is terminated; the center tank transfer valves close when the center tank low level sensors are dry and 5 minutes time delay has elapsed. There are four low level sensors per wing tank: - two for 1500 kg level, - two for 750 kg level. When the fuel level in the wing tanks has decreased and two 1500 kg level sensors in a wing are continuously dry for 30 seconds, a MEMO message is shown. When the fuel level still decreases and two 750 kg low-level sensors in a wing are continuously dry for 30 seconds a low fuel level warning is triggered, i.e. single chime, MASTER CAUTion. When the engines are stopped, the engine identification numbers become amber.

The system mainly provides: - fuel mass/temperature measurement and display, - control of automatic aircraft refueling, - system integrity monitoring using BITE, - ARINC 429 digital data for interface to other systems. The ultracomp has three functions: - variable capacitors value, which has the same function as the dualcomp, - a velocimeter measurement function, - a temperature sensing function. The FQIC uses all this information together with the dual comp to calculate the density of the fuel. FQIC The Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC) does the fuel mass calculations and controls the whole system by means of various interfaces. The FQIC has two identical channels. Each channel calculates the tank quantities and monitors the status of the other channel. The healthiest channel is in control. If one channel fails, the system operates normally, but the ECAM will indicate a failure warning on the upper Display Unit (DU) as well as the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) report will indicate the failure. PROBES FLSCU The Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCUs) are mainly used: - to shut the related refuel valve when the high level is reached in each tank, - to initiate the BITE test of the high level sensors and their related circuits, by using the test switch on the refuel/defuel control panel. High level sensors in each tank send a signal to the FQIC, via the FLSCU. The test is initiated via the FQIC and the FLSCU. Sensor and system status are sent from the FQIC to the CFDS. REFUEL/DEFUEL CONTROL PANEL A set of capacitance probes in each tank sends a signal to the computer in relation to the fuel level in the tank. A single probe failure doesn't affect the system indication. In each wing tank, a diode is attached to fuel probe No. 2 that gives the fuel temperature to the FQIC for indication on the ECAM system display. The FQIC provides automatic shut-off at a preselected refuel quantity. When the MODE SELECT switch on the refuel/defuel control panel has been set to the REFUEL position, the FQIC first makes sure that it is physically possible to take the preselected fuel quantity into the aircraft. Throughout the automatic refuel operation the FQIC monitors the density of fuel in each tank and the distribution of the load. DUALCOMP MTI The dualcomp is installed in the fuel tank and operates as a variable capacitor. The capacitance value is a result of the density of the fuel between the plates. The fuel density changes with temperature and type of fuel. A Multi Tank Indicator (MTI) displays the fuel quantity in each tank. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 138 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY FWC ECAM The FWC operates the audible warning and causes the MASTER CAUT light to come on. Total and individual tank fuel mass information is sent to the ECAM for display. PRESELECTOR The pre-selector shows the pre-selected and actual total fuel quantities, as monitored by the computer. LGCIU 1 The FQIC receives the left and right L/G compressed information from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1. L/G CONTROL LEVER The FQIC receives ground information from the L/G when selected DOWN with the aircraft on jacks. This signal is used to give electrical supply to the FQIC in this specific configuration. ADIRS Acceleration data is received from the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) during flight and is used as an alternate source of attitude. Normally, effects of attitude, changes in acceleration, effective pitch and roll angles, are calculated from the height of fuel at each probe and the knowledge of the tank geometry stored in the computer memory. CFDS ARINC 429 output links transmit BITE information from the computer to the CFDS. The CFDS monitors fault conditions and BITE. FMGC Fuel parameters are sent to the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs), for navigation computations.

BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. - 2 in each wing for 1500 kg (3307 lbs) fuel level, in case of exposure to air for more than 30 s: low fuel level advisory on the memo page, - 2 in each wing for 750 kg (1653 lbs) fuel level, in case of exposure to air for more than 30 s: low fuel level warning on the ECAM. Exposure of the optional ACT low-level sensors causes the fuel FWD transfer to stop. GENERAL FULL LEVEL The aircraft has two multi-channel Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCUs) and a third one, if the Additional Center Tank (ACT) is installed. They supply high fuel level sensing, low fuel level sensing, full fuel level sensing, underfull fuel level sensing, and overflow level and temperature sensing. Fuel level and temperature sensors feed signals to the multi-channel amplifiers. The FLSCUs detect and amplify the signals and trigger switching functions in the appropriate circuits. When the full level is reached in one wing tank, the center transfer valve closes to stop fuel transfer operation from the center tank to the wing tank until the fuel level in the wing tank reaches the underfull level. B2 SCOPE HIGH LEVEL The high level sensors, when immersed in fuel, command the closure of the associated tank refuel valve when the MODE SELECT switch is set to the REFUEL position. Wet high-level sensors cause the associated: - tank refuel valves to shut, - blue HIGH LEVEL lights to come on, on the refuel/defuel control panel. The wet center tank high-level sensor causes fuel transfer from the optional ACT to the center tank to stop. LOW LEVEL The center tank low-level sensors control the automatic transfer of fuel from the center tank to the wing tanks. When sensors become dry for 5 minutes, the FLSCUs send a close signal to the related control valve. 4 low-level sensors are used in each wing tank: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) UNDERFULL LEVEL When the fuel level in the wing tanks drop to the underfull sensors, the center tank transfer valves are controlled to open for a fuel transfer operation, provided there is fuel in the center tank. The difference between full and underfull level sensors is equal to a fuel quantity of 200 kg (440 lbs). OVERFLOW LEVEL When full level is reached in the wing tank and overflows into the vent surge tank, the overflow sensor sends a signal to the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) to close the Fuel Return Valve (FRV). TEMPERATURE SENSOR The temperature sensor commands the closure of the FRV, when the temperature of the fuel in the wing exceeds the limits i.e. 52.5\u00b0C (126.5\u00b0F).

Too much pressure in the inner cell or in the vent surge tank causes fuel to be released overboard through an overpressure protector installed on a tank access panel. The center tank overpressure protector releases fuel into the left wing tank. GENERAL The fuel tank venting system prevents overstressing of tanks. VENT SURGE TANK Each vent surge tank vents to the atmosphere through a NACA type intake connected to a vent duct. A vent protector and a flame arrestor are in the vent duct. The function of the vent protector is to prevent clogging of the vent duct by ice formation. The flame arrestor decreases the risk of a ground fire which could cause ignition of the fuel tanks. Fuel spilled through the vent pipes into the surge tank is put back into the outer cell by a scavenge jet pump that uses motive power from the wing fuel pumps. VENT FLOAT VALVE This valve will let the air flow between the wing tank and the related surge tank to keep an equal pressure. The float valve will close when the wing tank is full to prevent fuel spills into the surge tank. WING TANK VENTING SYSTEM Each wing tank vents to the related vent surge tank. The ducts are sufficiently large to make sure that if there is a failure of the pressure refueling shut-off system, excess fuel will be discharged overboard through the NACA intake. A rubber check valve installed in the vent line lets all fuel that goes into the vent lines drain back to the related tank. CENTER TANK VENTING SYSTEM The center tank vents into the LH vent surge tank. The center tank vent line is a standard open line that includes a check valve and is sufficiently large for an airflow. If the center tank is filled with too much fuel, most of the fuel flows to the right wing tank through the relief valve. OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION Overpressure protectors are installed in the system to release pressure in the tanks that can be caused by a vent blockage or a pressure refueling gallery failure. Too much pressure in the outer cell causes fuel to be released into the inner cell through an overpressure protector Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 148 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL - VENT SURGE TANK ...

The filter cleans the air that goes into the tank. GENERAL The Additional Center Tanks (ACTs) are extensions of the center tank and are installed in the aft and FWD cargo compartments. ACTs to center tank transfer is automatically controlled in flight. Cabin air pressure pressurizes the ACTs for the transfer. TRANSFER Automatic transfer is the normal mode in flight. If there is system failure or flight at low level or on ground, manual transfer mode is selectable. The automatic transfer occurs when: - the A/C is in flight, - the slats are retracted, - the MODE SELector P/BSW is in the AUTO position, - one ACT low level sensor minimum is wet, - the center tank fuel level drops to 5000 Kg (11030 lb). When the fuel level reaches 5750 kg (12700 lb), the transfer stops, until it drops again to 5000 kg (11030 lb). These conditions open the fuel inlet valve and the fuel transfer valve on the fuel transfer line. For manual transfer, the MODE SEL P/BSW must be pushed and the rotary selector set to the ACT that is to be transferred. This condition opens the fuel inlet valve, the fuel transfer valve and only if the aircraft is on ground, the ACT transfer pump is energized. In flight, the cabin pressure will be used to transfer the fuel. PRESSURIZATION SYSTEM When the automatic fuel MODE SEL transfer is selected, the ACT air shutoff valve opens and lets the air pressure from the cargo compartment pressurize the ACTs. Fuel is then transferred from the ACT to the center tank by pressurization. The pressure-reducing valve regulates the ACTs air pressure to around 0.34 bar (5 psi) more than ambient air pressure.

This regulation is related to the prevention of ignition sources in fuel tanks of current type certificated aircraft. It requires a one-time fuel system safety and design review of the aircraft. Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) The FAA issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 88 which gives a detailed description of the CDCCL concept. The DGAC requested the SFAR 88 to be added to PART 145, PART M and PART 147 to reinforce the application of these regulations. This includes: - a conception part related to aircraft design characteristics, - a maintenance part. A CDCCL is a limitation requirement to keep a critical ignition source prevention characteristic of the fuel system design that is necessary to prevent the occurrence of a dangerous condition. The function of the CDCCL is to give instructions to keep the critical ignition source prevention characteristic during a configuration change that can be caused by alterations, repairs or maintenance actions. The aircraft manufacturers must supply a document to their customers that gives the list of all the maintenance tasks related to the CDCCL. For AIRBUS, this document is called the Fuel Airworthiness Limitations and it is added to the Airworthiness Limitation Section part 5.

The liquid fuel does not blow up on its own; explosive conditions are created when specific proportions of evaporated fuel, oxygen, pressure and temperature are present in the tank ullage; the fuel vapor is then defined as flammable. Even if the ullage is flammable, an explosion will not occur unless an ignition source of sufficient energy exists. The combustion triangle: An Explosion in a \"Fuel\" environment such as aircraft wing tanks can only occur if the 3 following sources are reached: - fuel vapors, - air (Oxygen O2), - ignition (Electrical short cut, cigarette, etc.). The aircraft fuel system has, by design, a number of features that are intended to protect the system from inadvertent ignition. The potential sources of ignition considered are: - spark generation inside a fuel tank by electrical current originated from external sources such as a lightning strike on the aircraft, by wiring or equipment electrical faults, - spark/heat generation inside a fuel tank caused by friction of moving parts, - fuel leakage outside of a fuel tank coming into contact with an ignition source. A chart shows the fuel grades used. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which the liquid supplies enough vapors mixed with ambient air, to make a gas that will ignite with the contact of a thermal source, also called flame. At this temperature the combustion will not be self sufficient, because you need to reach the ignition point. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD If the ignition does not need a flame, we talk about auto-ignition. The Auto-Ignition point is the temperature at which a gas or a vapor ignites spontaneously in the absence of a thermal source. Do not confuse this term with the ignition point (temperature at which the combustion is started and can continue).

Composite ribs are bonded by means of metallic strips attached to the non-metallic structure. All aluminum structural items in the wing, trim and centre boxes have a finishing for protection against electrical harnesses short-circuit with the structure. The combination of the construction and thickness of the tank boundary skins give protection against a lightning strike causing ignition (heat). - Fuel Quantity Indicating (FQI) Equipment: Probes and sensors installed in tanks have low power supply. Electrical connection is done through a terminal block. The protective gap between the probes and the tank structure is maintained. They are electrically isolated from the structure. - Fuel pump: Fuel pumps have safety features to prevent pumps from working in an empty fuel tank. The pumps are tested to show that even after a long working condition in an \"empty fuel tank\" the rotating surfaces remain lubricated and thus limit the risk of mechanical ignition. Each of the pumps is contained within an explosion-proof canister. It comprises a pump element contained within and electrically bonded to the canister and driven by an electric motor. Electrical connections to all pumps are made outside the tank. The moving parts inside the pump are normally submerged in fuel so they cannot generate a spark during faulty conditions. - Lightning Protection: All equipment installed within any fuel tank is bonded to the structure Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) - Fuel System Wiring: Only when absolutely necessary, wiring is routed inside fuel tanks. This wiring is limited to sensing and monitoring systems, with very low energy carrying requirements, to protect against the occurrence of an ignition source as a result of high energy entering the fuel tank via the wiring. External electrical wiring support clamps make sure, that a cut cable cannot come into contact with the fuel tank boundary or structure in a fuel vapor area. There is a complete segregation between in-tank wiring equipment and fuel calculators from other aircraft system wirings. - Valves: All motor operated valves within the fuel tanks have the actuator located outside the tank wall. The valve mechanisms inside the tank are dual bonded and do not have an ignition hazard. - Pressure Switches: Pump pressure switches are mounted on the tank boundaries. They are separated from the fuel by a diaphragm. The electrical connections are fully sealed and explosion proof. - Fuel Leaks: It is possible for fuel or fuel vapor to leak from a fuel tank into an adjacent area and the accumulated fuel can become hazardous causing ignition. Fuel leaks from the wing and trim tanks go either to the leading or trailing edge cavities or to the outside. Any fuel overflowing from the NACA intake is directed downwards and away from the engines (heat source) via a fuel leak drip strip (angle section) located inboard of the NACA intake. In the leading and trailing edges the equipment is explosion proofed and insulated from the leakage. The APU fuel feed and Trim Tank transfer pipes at the rear fuselage are shrouded so any fuel leakage is drained overboard via the drain mast. - Heat Sources: Wing leading edges contain hot air ducting from the engines to the bleed air and anti icing systems. These pipes are insulated and separated from the tank boundary.

With normal power established, opening the access panel will power up the refuel control panel automatically. To refuel on batteries, select BATT POWER to ON. To start refueling in the automatic mode after the refuel panel is powered, follow these steps: - perform the Lights (LTS) and High Level (HI. LVL) test. The high level test verifies the operation of the high-level protection system, which provides protection against overfilling and spillage. - make sure that the REFUEL VALVE switches are in the NORM position - set the Pre-selector to the required total fuel load - set the MODE SELECT to REFUEL There is no refuel valve indicator. The indication that the valve is open is an increase in the fuel quantity. When the refueling is complete, the END light will illuminate. The PRESELECTED and ACTUAL quantities should be equal (\u00b1 100 kg.).

Always use the current Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) as the reference and adhere to ALL safety precautions. drain valve. If the drain valve leaks, re-seat the valve by pushing up and releasing the drain valve. The fuel removed may be tested for water content using a test kit. ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS Do not discharge products such as oil, fuel, solvent, lubricant either in trash bins, soil or into the water network (drains, gutters, rain water, waste water, etc...). Sort waste fluids and use specific waste disposal containers. Each product must be stored in an appropriate and specific cabinet or room such as a fire-resistant and sealed cupboard. DRAIN WATER CONTENT All drains should be operated to insure proper water removal from the fuel. There are 2 drains in the center tank, 1 in each wing tank inner cell, 1 in each wing tank outer cell (A318/319/320 only) and 1 in each vent surge tank. The remote inlet water drain valves in the wing cell or wing tank area have a remote inlet, with a short pipe connected to it, which goes to the lowest part of the fuel tank. The water drain valves in the center tank and the vent surge tanks do not have a remote inlet. Thus they only drain their adjacent area. If possible, the best time to drain the water from the tanks is prior to refueling. If that is not possible, wait one hour after refueling. The center tank drain valves are found in the electric hydraulic pump compartments just forward of the wheel well in the belly fairing. The wing drain valves are accessible on the lower surface of the wing. To operate the drain valves, use the PURGER tool and push up on the valve. Make sure to drain at least one liter of fuel for proper water removal. Adapting pipes are available for the PURGER tools to operate the wing drain valves from the ground. When draining is complete remove the PURGER tool and insure that there is no leakage at the Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 236 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY DAILY CHECKS - DRAIN WATER CONTENT & ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 237 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) DAILY CHECKS (continued) SAFETY PRECAUTIONS The Fuel Tank Inerting System (FTIS) gives gases with low oxygen content, referred to as Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA). This NEA starts in the ullage space of the center tank and goes to the surge tank. There is a possible risk of asphyxiation in the left wing surge tank if you put your head through the NACA duct access panel and the center tank access panels. Placards are installed in these spaces to tell you of this risk.

The first procedure involves a failed refuel valve. The aircraft may be dispatched per MEL and refueling of the affected tank is accomplished by manual operation of the refuel valve. The second procedure is the use of the Magnetic Level Indicators (MLI). The MLI's are used to check fuel quantity in the tanks in case of an indication malfunction or during refueling with no electrical power. system or the MLI's if electrical power is not available (there will be slight reduction in tank capacity if the Intercell transfer valves are open - see AMM for tank quantities). When the desired quantity is reached, release the plunger to close the valve. The most important thing to remember is that there is NO High Level protection when operating the refuel valve with the manual plunger. CAUTION: The following task summaries are only presented for training, and are not supposed to be used to service an aircraft. Always use the current Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) as the reference and adhere to ALL safety precautions. MANUAL REFUEL VALVE OPERATION During refueling, the refuel valve solenoid is energized and fuel pressure from the tanker/pump unit opens the valve. If the solenoid fails or if the electrical control of the solenoid fails, the valve may be operated manually by a plunger on the valve. There are 3 refuel valves on the aircraft. The center tank valve is located in the R/H wheel well on the forward wall (which is actually the center tank rear spar). The wing tank refuel valves are located on the left and right wing leading edge near the refuel coupling. The refuel/Defuel coupling shown is the optional one on the LH side. NOTE: Remember: On the A318/A319/A320, during wing refueling all of the fuel goes to the outer cell and spills over into the inner cell, so only one refuel valve per wing is required. To refuel a tank, PUSH and HOLD the manual plunger on the valve. The fuel pressure from the tanker/pump unit will open the valve. Be sure to monitor the fuel quantity carefully using the normal indication Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 240 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY MEL/DEACTIVATION - MANUAL REFUEL VALVE OPERATION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 241 of 254 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MEL/DEACTIVATION (continued) USE OF MAGNETIC LEVEL INDICATORS Each fuel tank is equipped with one or more Magnetic Level Indicators (MLI's). In case of an indication malfunction or during refueling without electrical power available, the MLI's may be used to check fuel quantity. There is one MLI in the center tank, 4 in each wing tank on the A318/319/320 and 3 in each wing on the A321. To use the MLI, extend the indicator rod and read the UNITS mark nearest to the bottom skin of the wing. Each tank is checked separately. The center and outer tanks have a single MLI each. This MLI is enough to determine the fuel volume in that tank. The wing tanks have multiple MLI's. To determine the wing volume, use the most outboard MLI, which indicates fuel in the tank. To check the total fuel quantity on the aircraft determine the total in each tank (CTR, INNER, OUTER) and add them together.

Carefully lift the MLI until you feel the magnet engaging. Read and write down the value indicated on the MLI. MEL/DEACTIVATION (continued) FUEL LEVEL MAGNETIC INDICATOR In case of failure of the quantity indicating system the fuel Manual Magnetic Indicators (MMIs) must be used to monitor the quantity in the tanks. One MMI is installed in the center tank and five in each wing tank. Each MMI assembly is made of a MLI rod that can extend out of its MLI housing (listed in AMM by MLI reference, or Magnetic Level Indicator). To measure the fuel quantity, the magnetic level indicator has to be unlocked. To accomplish this, use a screwdriver to push the applicable MLI rod and turn it through 90\u00b0. Hold and carefully lower the MLI rod fully. Then carefully lift the MLI rod until you feel the magnets. Read the units mark nearest to the bottom-skin of the wing and write down the number. Retract the MLI rod and use a screwdriver to turn through 90\u00b0 the bayonet type lock. The Magnetic Level indicators are a secondary direct reading gage to calculate the fuel in the Aircraft tanks, if the Fuel quantity indication system is unserviceable. You must follow the fuel safety procedures when working with the fuel system. Put the safety barriers in the position. The density of the fuel is essential for calculating the mass of fuel in the aircraft tanks. Take a fuel sample from the aircraft and measure its specific density. On the A321, 3 magnetic level indicators are installed per wing, and one per center tank. The A318, A319, A320 are equipped with 4 Magnetic level indicators per wing and one per center tank. Put an access platform below the applicable MLI, start outboard. Use a screwdriver to push the applicable MLI and turn it to 90\u00b0 degrees. Hold and lower the MLI fully. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD NOTE: The value on the MLI nearest to the wing bottom skin is the relevant one. Insert and lock the MLI as soon as possible to avoid damage. Aircraft attitude data is essential for fuel mass calculation. Indication of pitch and roll data can be selected through the MCDU in the cockpit. Data is provided by the air data inertial reference unit, or by the fuel quantity indication computer. Refer to the table in the AMM to find the equivalent reference number and letter. Use the applicable MLI stick number and the applicable aircraft attitude grid square letter to find the correct fuel quantity table in the AMM. Find the applicable MLI units number row and the applicable aircraft attitude row in the AMM table.Determine the intersection of the applicable rows to give the correct volume in the tank. NOTE: Note: Only even number MLI units are listed in the tables. For odd numbers, calculate the volume between the nearest even number in the AMM table For fuel mass calculation the volume has to be multiplied with the density of the fuel. V(dm3) x Fuel(kg/dm3)= kg Add together the values for each tank to find the total mass of fuel in the aircraft.

It is possible to use the attitude information generated by the air data system through the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) or by the fuel system through the Fuel Quantity Indicating Computer (FQIC), FQIS INPUT PARAMETERS page. It is essential to use the correct fuel tables based on aircraft attitude. The air data inputs to the ADIRU can be read by using the alpha call-up function in the Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS). With the ADIRU's in the NAV position, select the AIDS menu in CFDS. From this menu, select CALL UP PARAM ALPHA. To access roll data type ROLL, and to access pitch data type PTCH. After recording the data, convert the pitch and roll references given to the equivalent grid-square. For example: ADIRU PITCH (-1.0) = 2 ADIRU ROLL (-0.5) = C Equivalent Grid-square = C2 The attitude information input to the FQIC may be accessed through the CFDS FQIS INPUT PARAMETERS page. The pitch and roll data can be used from the ADIRU if the data is available. ADIRU data is identified by an 'A' after PITCH or ROLL. After recording the data, convert the pitch and roll references in the same manner as the ADIRU data above.

The final step is to convert the volume to mass. Multiply the volume by the fuel specific gravity. For example with the MLI n\u00b05 in the RIGHT wing Attitude reference : C2 UNITS reading on the MLI : 10 Volume in liters : 850 Sp. Gravity - 0.81 Fuel mass = 688.5 Kg. NOTE: Only even-numbered MLI units are listed in the tables. To calculate the volume of fuel for odd numbers, interpolate (divide the difference) between the nearest even numbers in the table.

A white cross should be visible on a black background. If it is not visible, it may indicate a problem with the tank venting system. When aircraft emergency electrical power is used, two wing fuel boost pumps will be supplied, one in each wing. For dispatch per the MEL, both of these pumps must be operational. According to the AMM, during refueling operations bonding is essential, grounding is recommended. Connect a bonding cable between the fuel tanker and a grounding point on the aircraft, typically on the Nose or Main gear. Connect a grounding cable from a grounding point on the aircraft to the ground.

On the blue system the normal source of pressure is the electrical pump (E-Pump) and as auxiliary source the Ram Air Turbine (RAT). NOTE: The blue electric pump can be used as an auxiliary power source for maintenance purposes on ground. On the yellow system the normal source of pressure is the EDP and as auxiliary sources the PTU and the electric pump (E- Pump). An interlock mechanism will only permit RAT stowage if the blades are properly aligned. It also prevents rotation when stowed. The interlock will release at approximately 5 degrees from the full extension position. Extension is by spring force. Retraction (stowage) is by blue hydraulic pressure. Up lock release is by solenoid operation. Down lock release is by hydraulic pressure. NOTE: The yellow system also has a hand pump dedicated to cargo door operation. PTU The PTU is an auxiliary pressure supply for either the green or yellow systems without transfer of fluid between the two systems. It operates automatically if there is a delta pressure of 500psi between the green / yellow or yellow / green hydraulic systems. The side operating as a pump will take fluid from its associated reservoir and provide an output through the PTU manifold to the HP manifold. The motor side is supplied from the HP manifold through the PTU manifold, and is connected to the return system. The PTU is de-activated by closing the solenoid valves on the PTU manifolds. Each section of the PTU has a case drain connection to the return system. RAT The RAT is an auxiliary pressure supply for the blue system, and for the emergency electrical power Constant Speed Motor/Generator (CSM / G). It can be deployed automatically or manually depending on the failure conditions. The RAT is locked when extended.

BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. GENERAL Most of the system components are installed in the MLG compartment. RESERVOIR The reservoir has a direct reading gauge, a quantity indicator and a low level switch for ECAM indicating and warning. There are three levels: - Normal fill level: 14 l. (3.7 US gal), - Maximum gaugeable level: 18 l. (4.76 US gal), - Low level warning: 3.0 \u00b1 0.4 l. (0.79 \u00b1 0.1 US gal). The EDP is attached to the accessory gearbox. A solenoid valve controlled by the ENG 1 PUMP P/B selects the pressurized or depressurized mode. The EDP cooling and lubricating flow goes through the case drain filter installed in the return circuit. Pump outlet pressure is 3000 psi (206 bar) at zero flow. The EDP includes a blocking valve, which isolates the pump from the hydraulic system when the pump operates in depressurized mode. Case drain filter clogging indication: P = 87 \u00b1 8.7 psi (6 \u00b1 0.6 bar). ACOUSTIC FILTER The acoustic filter is installed in the outlet from the green EDP. It removes the pulses of pressure of the HP flow from the pump. The acoustic filter is an empty metal sphere, with inlet and outlet connections on opposite sides. PRESSURE SWITCH RESERVOIR PRESSURIZATION The reservoir is normally pressurized with air to prevent cavitation of the pumps. The reservoir is pressurized to 50 psi (3.45 bar) and is sealed to hold the pressure when there is no air supply. The threshold of the LP switch is 22 psi (1.52 bar). The threshold of the pressure relief valve is 77 psi (5.3 bar). FIRE VALVE The green system fire valve installed in the LH wing, inboard of the pylon, is controlled by ENG 1 FIRE P/B. When the valve closes, it stops the supply of fluid to the Engine Driven Pump (EDP). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) The EDP pressure switch monitors the EDP outlet pressure for ECAM indications. The threshold of the pressure switch is 1740 psi (120 bar). NOTE: A check valve downstream of the pump stops the fluid flow to the pump if the system is pressurized by the PTU. GROUND COUPLINGS The ground service panel has two connectors used to pressurize the green hydraulic system from a ground cart. A selector valve, two connectors and a hand pump are used for hydraulic reservoir refilling.

PRESSURE SWITCHES The signals from both pressure switches at the HP manifold are sent to the Flight Control Computers (FCCs), to the Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU), the ECAM will receive information from one of the two switches for LP indication, and to the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). The threshold of the pressure switches is 1450 psi (99.5 bar). A sampling valve is provided on the HP manifold. NOTE: CAUTION: when sampling, let the fluid run for a moment into a container, then put 0.2L (0.05USG) of fluid into an appropriate bottle for analysis. PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE The system relief valve connects the HP circuit to the return circuit in case of overpressure. The relief valve opens at 3436 psi (237 bar) and closes at 3190 psi (220 bar). PRESSURE TRANSDUCER The pressure transducer provides data for pressure indication on the ECAM and sends information to Elevator Aileron Computers (ELACs) 1 and 2. LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVE The leak measurement valve isolates the primary flight controls when the guarded LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVES P/B on the maintenance panel is set to OFF. HP FILTER The HP filter has a clogging indicator. The clogging indicator operates when the differential pressure is higher than 87 \u00b1 8.7 psi (6 \u00b1 0.6 bar). ACCUMULATOR The accumulator acts as a damper for small changes. It also makes a supply of fluid available in case of any demand. The accumulator is precharged with nitrogen to 1885 psi (130 bar) at 20\u00b0C. It holds 1.1l (0.29 US gal) of total volume of fluid when it is full.

After closing the related leak measurement valve, operating manually a spool valve lets the related section be supplied for leak measurement testing. PTU MANIFOLD The PTU manifold is composed of three different valves: - The normal braking selector valve which cuts the hydraulic supply to the normal brakes, - The solenoid valve installed in the PTU supply line which stops the PTU operation, - The priority valve which makes sure that all available hydraulic pressure is sent to the primary flight controls if pressure in the system is reduced. RETURN MANIFOLD The return manifold comprises: - One return filter with a clogging indicator and a by-pass device, - One temperature sensor which has one temperature switch and two temperature transducers. The red pin of clogging indicator comes out when the differential pressure across the filter is more than 29 \u00b1 4.4 psi (2 \u00b1 0.3 bar). The by-pass operates when the differential pressure across the filter is more than 58 \u00b1 6.0 psi (4.0 \u00b1 0.4 bar). Then the device lets the fluid go from inlet to outlet without filtration. The temperature switch and temperature transducers send data for ECAM warnings and indication on overhead P/Bs.

As an option, a PTU inhibition logic prevents the PTU from running in overspeed condition (Hyd reservoir low level on one sys) and later on leads to the loss of the second sys (Hyd reservoir overheat on the other sys). In flight, if the PTU is not able to pressurize a hydraulic failed system (G SYS LO PR or Y SYS LO PR) within 6 seconds, either due to external leakage or PTU failure, the PTU is automatically inhibited. This PTU inhibition logic is activated if both engines are running and remains activated as long as one engine is running. The 20s relay has been installed for the deactivation of the PTU inhibition logic. Once the PTU has been automatically inhibited, the logic is \"de-latched\" and PTU no longer inhibited 20 seconds after one of the following are met: - A/C on ground OR, - Both engines stopped, - The affected hydraulic system does not longer detect a low-pressure condition.

The reservoir is pressurized to 50 psi (3.43 bar) and is sealed to hold the pressure when there is no air supply. The threshold of the air pressure switch is 22 psi (1.52 bar). The threshold of the air pressure relief valve is 77 psi (5.3 bar). ELECTRIC PUMP With the ELECtric (ELEC) PUMP P/B set to AUTO, the blue electric pump will run, if one engine is running, or the BLUE PUMP OverRiDe (OVRD) P/B is set to ON, or NLG is not compressed and AC power is available from the APU. With the last condition, at touchdown a time delay relay maintains the pump operation for two minutes after NLG compression. The pump outlet pressure is 3000 psi (206 bar) at zero flow. A temperature switch sends a signal to the ECAM if the pump body temperature exceeds 165\u00b0C. The electric pump cooling and lubricating flow goes through the case drain filter installed in the return circuit. Case drain filter clogging indication: P = 87 \u00b1 8.7 psi (6 \u00b1 0.6 bar). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) is deployed automatically if all AC electrical power sources are lost at speeds greater than 100 kts, or manually by using either one of the guarded P/Bs. The pressure switch monitors the electric pump pressure for ECAM indications. The threshold of the pressure switch is 1450 psi (99.5 bar). A check valve stops the flow of fluid to the electric pump if the system is pressurized by the RAT.

As an option, a PTU inhibition logic prevents the PTU from running in overspeed condition (Hyd reservoir low level on one sys) and later on leads to the loss of the second sys (Hyd reservoir overheat on the other sys). In flight, if the PTU is not able to pressurize a hydraulic failed system (G SYS LO PR or Y SYS LO PR) within 6 seconds, either due to external leakage or PTU failure, the PTU is automatically inhibited. This PTU inhibition logic is activated if both engines are running and remains activated as long as one engine is running. The 20s relay has been installed for the deactivation of the PTU inhibition logic. Once the PTU has been automatically inhibited, the logic is \"de-latched\" and PTU no longer inhibited 20 seconds after one of the following are met: - A/C on ground OR, - Both engines stopped, - The affected hydraulic system does not longer detect a low-pressure condition.

The HP manifold supplies the PTU manifold and the leak measurement manifold. PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE PRESSURE SWITCHES The signals from both HP manifold pressure switches are sent to the ECAM system, to the Flight Control Computers (FCCs) , to the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) 2, the Brake and Steering Control Unit (BSCU) as well as the Alternate Brake Control Unit (ABCU). The threshold of the pressure switches is 1450 psi (99.5 bar). The system relief valve connects the HP circuit to the return circuit in case of overpressure. The relief valve opens at 3436 psi (237 bar) and closes at 3190 psi (220 bar). ACCUMULATOR The accumulator acts as a damper for small changes. It also acts as a supply of fluid available in case of request. The accumulator is pre-charged with nitrogen to 1885 psi (130 bar) at 20\u00b0C. It holds 1l (0.26 US gal) of total volume of fluid when it is full. PRESSURE TRANSDUCER The pressure transducer gives data for pressure indication on the ECAM and sends information to ELevator Aileron Computers (ELACs) 1 and 2. LEAK MEASUREMENT MANIFOLD (OPTIONAL) LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVE The leak measurement valve isolates the primary flight controls when the guarded LEAK MEASUREMENT VALVES P/B on the maintenance panel is set to OFF (white OFF light is illuminated). The solenoid valve is automatically closed if the yellow electric pump is energized by using cargo door selectors. This is to prevent any movement of the flight controls. The optional leak measurement manifold supplies the flight controls of the RH wing, LH wing and tail section via three outputs. Operating manually, a spool valve lets the associated section of the flight controls be supplied for leak measurement testing. HP FILTER The PTU manifold is composed of one disconnection and two different valves. The High Pressure (HP) filter has a clogging indicator. The clogging indicator operates when the differential pressure is higher than 87 \u00b1 8.7 psi (6 \u00b1 0.6 bar). PTU MANIFOLD QUICK DISCONNECT SAMPLING VALVE The quick disconnect is used for maintenance operations to prevent PTU operation. A sampling valve is installed on the HP manifold. SOLENOID VALVE The solenoid valve installed in the PTU supply line, stops the PTU operation.

RETURN MANIFOLD The return manifold comprises: - one return filter with a clogging indicator and a by-pass device, - one temperature sensor which has one temperature switch and two temperature transducers. The red pin of the clogging indicator pops out when the differential pressure across the filter is more than 29 \u00b1 4.4 psi (2 \u00b1 0.3 bar). The by-pass operates when the differential pressure across the filter is more than 58 \u00b1 6.0 psi (4.0 \u00b1 0.4 bar). Then the device allows fluid to go from inlet to outlet without filtration. The temperature switch and temperature transducers send data for ECAM warnings and indication on overhead P/Bs.

Each reservoir is pressurized by air at 50 psi (3.5 bar). The system also remains airtight in the event of pressurization system failure or after engine shutdown. Pressurized air from a ground supply cart goes directly to the reservoir pressurization unit through a ground connector. SOURCES A filter fitted with a clogging indicator is installed in the reservoir pressurization unit to filter the air from the different supply sources. The pressure sources are engine 1, via a restrictor or both engines and the APU, via the pneumatic manifold. The pressure sources are: - the engine 1 High Pressure (HP) compressor for usual operation, - the pneumatic system in case of loss of engine 1, - the ground supply. RESTRICTOR A restrictor limits the airflow and reduces the temperature of the HP air to a satisfactory level. The restrictor also prevents too much bleed air leakage in case of a leak downstream of the restrictor. RESERVOIR PRESSURIZATION UNIT The reservoir pressurization unit controls the pressure of the air supplied to the reservoirs. PRESSURE REDUCING VALVE A pressure reducing valve is fitted to the reservoir pressurization unit. In normal operation, the delivery pressure of engine 1 has priority over the pressure supply from the pneumatic manifold. The pressure reducing valve outlet pressure is 50 psi (3.5bar). Two check valves prevent any reverse flow. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) FILTER WATER SEPARATOR A water separator is installed on the reservoir pressurization unit. It makes sure that the air delivered to the reservoirs is clear of any fluid. There are two drain valves that prevent freezing of the water in the reservoir pressurization unit. One is an automatic drain valve that is opened after each engine or APU shutdown; the other one is a manual self-sealing drain valve. RESERVOIR CHECK VALVE Downstream of the reservoir pressurization unit, the air supply is divided into three flows to supply the reservoirs through their related check valve. The green and yellow check valves are installed between the floor beams above the hydraulic bay and the blue one is installed in the aft cargo compartment. PRESSURE GAGE An air pressure gage is installed on each hydraulic reservoir to indicate the actual pressure. The pressure switch generates LOW AIR PRESS warning if the pressure is less than 22 psi (1.52 bar).

(approximately 20 drops =1 cc, and 75600 drops =1 gallon) A leakage is a quantity of fluid on the surface of a component that is not sufficient to become a drop. A stain is an area on the surface of a component that has a different color. It is usually caused when fluid leakage becomes dry on the component surface after a high temperature operation. For a correct analysis of component leak rates, you must obey the subsequent steps: - the seal obtained at hydraulic tube connections is obtained on metal-to-metal surfaces. If a leak cannot be stopped by tightening the nut to the specified torque, the joint is probably defective and should be repaired. - when possible, activate components for some cycles before carrying out the external leakage check. - dynamic seals are easy to examine for leakage while in the static condition because pistons, slide valves and swivel joints move only during a short time interval. Many components cannot be obviously monitored during operation. - by following the AMM procedure operate the related component, - after operation, inspect the component. If there is a sign of any external leakage, compare the quantity of leakage with the values given in the AMM table for specified limits.

If you don't work carefully and follow these rules, your work may be the cause of the next hydraulic leak that delays or cancels a flight. Let's look at these basic hydraulic plumbing rules: contamination that gets into a system or collects on sealing surfaces can cause leaks internal and external. Hydraulic fluid itself is a contaminant. It can eat paint and decals. When hydraulic fluid is allowed to penetrate a composite structure, it will attack the core material and reduce it to mush. Once a composite assembly has been attacked, its structural integrity will be lost. To avoid damage caused by twisting, tearing, and chipping, always lubricate O-rings, packing seals, back-up rings, and fitting threads with hydraulic fluid before assembly. When assembling hydraulic system fittings, be sure that seals and back-up rings are properly positioned before torquing the connection. When installing an elbow fitting into a component, be sure that all the threads are completely screwed into the boss. This is to make sure that the O-ring packing rides in the undercut, and not on the threads. To prevent an elbow fitting from turning while its lock-nut is being torqued, hold it with a second wrench. To make a stress-free installation, be sure that all elbow-to-pipe connections are correctly aligned before torquing the B-nuts. Do not use pointed, sharp-edged, or steel tools to remove or install O-ring packing, back-up rings, and seals. Damage may occur. Never reinstall used O-ring packing or seals. Once they have been compressed, they will never regain their original shape again. Before torquing a B-nut, be sure that the tube fits squarely into the fitting. Never force or bend a tube to make it fit. Metal tubes don't stretch. If the piece seems shorter upon reinstallation or after a component change, something is wrong. Stop! Think! And investigate the problem before you proceed. Make sure that tubes are not forced into clamps or line blocks. A stressed installation will lead to a cracked tube at the nearest fitting or B-nut. And, you can bet it won't be Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) long before it happens. If clamps or line blocks are removed so a tube or component can be replaced, be sure that they are reinstalled again. Tubes that are not properly supported will vibrate. Vibration is the greatest enemy of a hydraulic system. It causes tubes to crack, and connections at fittings to loosen up and leak. When repairs are finished, always bleed the system, and leak check your work. We, the mechanics, have control of torquing. The lack of proper torquing is the single greatest cause of leaks. Those calibrated elbows are notorious for being out of calibration. Use a torque wrench.

The two pressure switches monitor the pressure downstream of the butterfly valve to sense a valve malfunction. If the pressure increases to 2.1 bar (30.5 psi) the related switch gives a \"high pressure\" signal. If the pressure decreases to 1.0 bar (14.5 psi) the related switch gives a \"low pressure\" signal. VALVES Hot air from the pneumatic system is supplied to each wing by an electrically controlled, pneumatically operated anti-ice control valve. The anti-ice control valves regulate the anti-icing pressure to approximately 23 psi. The valves also include high and low pressure switches to monitor the regulation function of the valve. In case of electrical failure or lack of pneumatic supply pressure, the valve closes. CONTROLS The wing anti-ice control valves are controlled from the cockpit by the WING Anti-Ice P/B. On the ground for test functions, a time-delay relay limits the opening of the valve to 30 seconds when the pushbutton switch is selected ON. DUCTS Air reaches slat 3 through a telescopic duct. It is distributed to the outboard slats by piccolo ducts, interconnected by flexible connections. A restrictor located downstream from the control valve adjusts the airflow. It also limits the flow in case of rupture of a distribution duct. USERS Only the three outboard slats are protected by the hot anti-icing air. Due to the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, slats 1 and 2 do not need to be protected.

It also sends the P/BSW configuration to the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) and to the Engine Interface Units (EIUs). The WAI P/BSW acquires a discrete signal from the fault relay for the illumination of the FAULT light, during either valves transit or in case of disagreement between valves position and system selection or in case of LP detection. EIU The EIUs acquire system selection for engine power increase according to the bleed demand. LGCIU The Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) send a shock absorber extended signal to the control relay to enable the system to be controlled when the A/C is in flight configuration. SDAC The SDACs acquire discrete inputs to display the system status on the ECAM warning page, ECAM MEMO page and ECAM BLEED page. ACSC The Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) 1 and 2 are interfacing with signals from the wing ice protection system. The ACSC acquires discrete inputs, to monitor the system and manage the bleed air. It stores failure data of the WAI system.

The hot air is then discharged overboard. For each engine, the anti-ice valve is controlled by a P/BSW located on the ANTI ICE section of the overhead panel. When the engine Anti-ice (A.ICE) valve is open, a signal is sent to the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC), which calculates the bleed air demand and sends the signal tothe Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) via the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The additional bleed demand decreases the maximum N1 for the CFM56 and PW6000 and the maximum Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) limit for the V2500 relative to the ambient conditions and the engine operating conditions. SOURCE Hot air for the engine anti-ice system is supplied by a dedicated HP Compressor (HPC) bleed: - on the V2500, 7th stage, - on the CFM-56, 5th stage, - on the PW6000, 9th stage. The nacelle installed on CFM56 TECH INSERTION: The modified Nacelle Anti-Icing (NAI) supply duct with the restrictor is required because of the new HPC higher air pressure and temperature at the 5th stage customer bleed ports. It complies with the certification requirement in case of duct rupture or failure occurring in the area of the NAI bleed air supply. ECAM PAGE If at least one of the two engine air intake anti-ice protection systems is selected ON, a message appears in green on the upper ECAM MEMO display. The signal received by EIU is used to avoid an unwanted anti ice fault ECAM warning on ground, when the engine is not running. VALVE The engine anti-ice system supply is controlled by an electrically controlled, pneumatically operated anti-ice valve. The solenoid is energized to CLOSE the valve, so in case of loss of electrical power supply, the valve will go fully open provided the engine bleed air supply pressure is high enough. In the absence of air pressure, the valve is spring-loaded to the closed position. NOTE: Note: The anti-ice valve of the CFM-56 engine uses an external 9th stage muscle supply to open the valve.

The CAPT, F/O and STBY systems are independent. Each one includes a Probe Heat Computer (PHC), which controls probe and static ports heating. As there are only 2 TAT probes, the first one on the CAPT and the second one on the F/O, PHC 3 is not linked to a TAT probe. CONTROL The probes and static ports heating come on automatically when at least one engine is running. It can also be manually activated by the PROBE/WINDOW HEAT P/B. On ground, pitot heating is reduced and TAT heating is cut off, the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) control both. The Probe Heating System is also switched ON automatically when the LCGIU sends a FLIGHT signal. PHC Heating monitoring and fault indication is given by the related PHC. A probe or a sensor heating failure is sent to the ECAM via an Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and the Flight Warning Computers (FWC). The PHC also transmits fault messages to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). CAUTION Pulling the PHC or Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply C/Bs causes unwanted heating of the probes and static ports.

Windshields are de-iced, sliding and fixed windows are demisted. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Window Heat Computer (WHC) is supplied with 28 VDC. The fixed and sliding side windows are supplied with 115 VAC and the windshield is supplied with 200 VAC (dual phase 115 V AC). CONTROL The heating is cut off, when the three ground signals are sent to the AND logic. The windshield and windows are heated either when one engine is running (AUTO) or when the PROBE/WINDOW HEAT P/B is set to ON. COMPUTER WHC 1 controls and monitors the left hand side of the system and WHC 2 controls and monitors the right hand side. The WHC identifies and memorizes the faulty component. It also incorporates protection against over voltage due to lightning strike or static electricity on the windows. The WHC supplies independent temperature regulation between 35 and 42\u00b0C (95 and 107.6\u00b0F). For safety: heating is cut off if temperature reaches +/-60\u00b0C (140 or -76\u00b0F). Oil LOW PRESSure and GrouND ReLaYs are energized by the Engine Interface Unit (EIU), when the related engine is not running. LGCIU Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) inputs are used for the two heating levels of the windshield. The power is reduced on ground. When flight configuration is detected, the windshield is fully heated by the dual phase current. SDAC The System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) receive two discrete inputs from each WHC, one for the windshield and one for both windows to tell the crew about a heating fault. CFDIU The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) is connected to the WHC for fault system transmission. The WHC is a type 2 system, with an ARINC 429 output and a maintenance test discrete input. USERS Each window comprises a heating element and two single loop sensors; one of the two sensors is a spare. Each windshield has a heating element and three loop sensors; only one sensor can be connected at a time. If that sensor fails, the maintenance has to swap the connectors to the spare sensor! The third sensor is an option.

The system operates independently on the CAPT side and on the F/O side. RAIN REPELLENT CIRCUIT The rain repellent fluid used is packaged in a nitrogen-pressurized can. The can is directly attached to the rain repellent fluid gauge. A purge P/B is used when the can is replaced. A nozzle sprays the rain repellent fluid onto the related windshield through four orifices. The spray nozzles are symmetrical but not interchangeable: - the CAPT spray nozzle is identified with red paint mark, - the F/O spray nozzle is identified with yellow paint mark. PURGE CIRCUIT The spray nozzle lines are permanently purged by air from cabin hot air supply. The blow-out reservoir works as a pressure accumulator, a decanting reservoir and has a test connection. OPERATION Upon actuation of the P/B, the time-controlled solenoid valve of the associated side releases out fluid to the spray nozzle for a preset period of time. To initiate a new cycle, it is necessary to release, then to press the P/B again. Between each cycle, the lines are automatically and permanently purged by hot air. The pressure indication shows the nitrogen pressure in the bottle. When the needle is in the yellow range, or the can is completely empty, the bottle should be replaced.

The dual advisory ice detection system is made of two ice detectors installed on the aircraft skin and directly connected to the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) to send warning messages to the crew on the Engine/Warning Display (EWD). When wing anti-ice valves are controlled to open, two ground signals are sent to the ice detectors in order to reset the ice detection counter and cut off the \"SEVERE\" signal. DETECTION Two levels of detection are given: - \"ICE DETECTED\" corresponding to an elementary detection, - \"SEVERE ICE DETECTED\" corresponding to 7 successive elementary detections. The ice detection system is operating at electrical power-up. It sends warning messages when the aircraft is in flight, depending on the altitude and when Total Air Temperature (TAT) is below 8\u00b0C (46.4\u00b0F), even with one ice detector faulty. MONITORING Each ice detector is installed with a BITE function for continuous monitoring. Each ice detector sends a \"FAULT\" signal to System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) 1 and 2 and to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) in case of failure during either power-up, MCDU or in operation tests. A class 2 fault message is displayed on the MCDU ANTI-ICE ICE DETECTOR 1 or 2 system page in case of ice detector failure. FWC MESSAGES The ice detectors generate three different discrete signals: - \"ICE DETECTED\" signal when engine air intake anti-ice is necessary, - \"SEVERE ICE DETECTED\" signal when wing anti-ice is necessary, - \"ICE DETECT FAULT\" signal when the two ice detectors are faulty. This displays class 1 warning messages on the EWD. These messages can be respectively inhibited by engine or wing anti-ice selection.

The protective covers help protect the probes from contamination. The covers should be marked with REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT. Ground personnel must insure that the covers are removed before flight or before power is applied to the probes (engine start or ground test). The probe heat system operates automatically to power the air data probe heaters when at least one engine is running. It is also designed to operate automatically when the aircraft is in flight. During the troubleshooting and the on ground operations, observe the following precautions: - if the Probe Heat Computer (PHC) power supply C/B is pulled, the PHC internal relay will relax and the related probes will be heated. Make sure to pull ALL of the associated probe heat C/B's (Static supply (28VDC), AOA supply, Pitot supply & TAT supply (all 115 VAC)). - if the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply C/B is pulled, the PHC will sense an \"engine running\" condition and the probes will be heated. Make sure to pull ALL of the probe heat C/B's (Static supply (28VDC), AOA supply, Pitot supply & TAT supply (all 115 VAC)). - if the C/B of the LGCIU is pulled, it simulates FLIGHT situation. So the probe heating is also switched ON.

The Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) displays are identical and controlled through the ECAM Control Panel (ECP). The Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) displays are controlled by the EFIS control panels and the lighting/loudspeaker control panels. The inputs received by the FWC are used to elaborate red warnings. Various items of information for systems like engines, fuel, navigation and which do not agree with a warning, are directly sent to the DMCs. The inputs received by the SDACs are used by the DMCs to display system pages and by the FWCs to generate most of amber warnings. DMC The Display Management Computers (DMCs) are data concentrators and receive data from aircraft sensors and systems. They send them to the Display Units (DUs). The DUs compute and display the images on each unit. In normal operation DMC1 drives the CAPT Primary Flight Display (PFD), the CAPT Navigation Display (ND), Engine/Warning Display (EWD) and System Display (SD). In normal operation DMC 2 drives the F/O PFD and ND DUs. If DMC 1 fails, it is automatically replaced by DMC 2 for ECAM only. DMC 2 cannot drive the CAPT PFD and ND; a manual switching to DMC 3 is required. DMC 3 can drive any of the six DUs. DMC 3 is a hot spare awaiting the failure of DMC 1 or 2 and can be switched to drive the DUs linked to the failed DMC. Data loading of the DMC 1 is possible with Portable Data Loader (PDL). FWC The Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) monitor the aircraft systems. Each FWC generates all warning and caution messages, supplies the attention getters, computes the flight phase and provides aural warnings. SDAC The System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) receive various signals from the aircraft systems and send them to the FWCs and to the DMCs.

The SD can display one of 11 system pages, cruise page or status page. In normal operation, the SD automatically shows the system pages according to the current flight phase. Nevertheless manual page selection is always possible. The CRUISE page is automatically displayed in flight (no manual selection). It displays the main system parameters to monitor during the flight. Priority is given to automatic display. The status page is an operational summary of the current aircraft condition. The information is displayed at the end of an ECAM procedure or upon crew request. The status page includes: - the limitation, approach procedures, information and cancelled cautions are displayed in the left column, - the inoperative systems below the caption \"INOP SYS\" and any class 2 system failure below the caption \"MAINTENANCE\" are displayed in the right column. At the bottom of the SD, below the grey line is the permanent data. It is always displayed whatever system page is present. Total Air Temperature (TAT) and Static Air Temperature (SAT) are digital values. International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is in fact a delta ISA indication that appears only in standard barometric reference mode only. The captions (TAT, SAT, ISA, GW ) are displayed in white and the units in cyan. The values are normally displayed in green. Load factor (G LOAD) is only displayed amber when the value is above 1.4 G or below 0.7 G for more than 2 seconds. The information remains in view for 5 seconds, when the excessive condition has disappeared. The display of the load factor is inhibited during flight phases 1 & 2.Feedback to the flight crew by providing system messages can also be Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) displayed in amber above or below the time indication. In case of degraded value, last 2 digits are dashed, in case of No Computed Data (NCD), 3 blues dashes replaces the values (on ground). Status, advisory and overflow are indications on the display. The advisory (ADV), appears by pulsing in white to indicate that an aircraft system parameter has drifted out of its normal operating range. In ECAM single display mode, the related page pushbutton will also flash on the ECAM Control Panel (ECP) to indicate to the crew which system page is affected by an advisory. The status (STS) indicates that a status message is on the ECAM status page. It appears below the grey stripe at the same location as the overflow arrow provided that this one is away. This message indicates to the pilot that the status page is no more empty. The overflow arrow indicates that the warning messages exceed the capacity of the display on the left memo area (7 lines). In this case, the heading titles of the warning messages are displayed on the right memo area.

The TO INHIBIT message disappears. The CRUISE page disappears when the landing gear is selected down and ALT below 16000ft. ECAM MODES (continued) AUTOMATIC MODE In normal operation the ECAM system pages are displayed according to the current flight phase, this mode is called automatic mode. A flight is divided into 10 phases corresponding to an aircraft configuration change. These flight phases are generated by the FWC and used by the Display Units (DUs) to automatically call up the system pages. DOOR (phase 1) The APU or engine pages are displayed in priority if the APU or the engines are started, in any flight phase. The APU page appears when APU master switch is switched ON. It disappears when APU master switch is switched OFF or the APU RPM is above 95% for 10 seconds. The ENGINE page appears at the beginning of the start sequence, and disappears 10 seconds after this start sequence. WHEEL (phase 7,8,9) During these phases, most warnings are inhibited. \"LDG INHIBIT\" is displayed on the right memo area of the EWD. \"LDG INHIBIT\" message disappears (flight phase 9). DOOR (phase 10) Five minutes after the last engine shutdown the FWC starts a new flight leg at phase 1. WHEEL (phase 2) The WHEEL page is displayed only after the engine start has been completed, and the Engine Start switch is returned to the Normal position. The FLighT ConTroL page replaces the WHEEL page for 20 seconds when either sidestick is moved or when rudder deflection is above 22 degrees.

ALERT CLASSIFICATION LEVEL 1 GENERAL The alerts are classified in three levels. They depend on the importance and urgency of the corrective actions required. - level 3: warnings (highest priority) - level 2: cautions - level 1: cautions - status messages At each level, the alert messages are also classified by priority order. LEVEL 3 Level 3 corresponds to an emergency configuration. Corrective or palliative action must be taken by the crew immediately. These warnings are associated with: - Continuous Repetitive Chime (CRC) or specific sound, - warning messages on Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), - MASTER WARNing light flashing red. Typical level 3 warnings are: - aircraft in dangerous configuration or limit flight conditions (Stall, overspeed), - system failure altering flight safety (Engine fire, excess cabin altitude), - serious system failure (Dual hydraulic failure). Level 1 agrees with a configuration requiring crew monitoring, mainly failures leading to a loss of redundancy or degradation of a system. The attention getters (lights and sounds) are not activated by a level 1 alert. STATUS Some defects which do not trigger warnings or cautions, but which require further maintenance actions, will be indicated to the crew by means of a status indication, pulsing after engine shutdown. It is necessary to call the status page manually to see the title of the affected system. LEVEL 2 Level 2 agrees with an abnormal configuration. Immediate crew awareness is required, but not immediate corrective action. The crew must decide when to take the corrective action. These warnings are associated with: - Single Chime (SC), - MASTER CAUTion light amber, - warning messages on LCD.

GENERAL The failures may be of three different types, independently of their classification. There are 3 separate types of warnings or cautions: - those associated with an independent failure, - those associated with a primary failure, - those associated with a secondary failure. INDEPENDANT FAILURE An independent failure is a failure, which affects an isolated item of equipment or system without affecting another one. Example: Flight Warning Computer (FWC) 1 failure. NOTE: An independent failure is displayed with the title underlined. PRIMARY FAILURE A primary failure is a failure of an item of equipment or system causing the loss of other equipment. Example: Green hydraulic system failure may lead to the loss of a pair of spoilers. NOTE: A primary failure is displayed with a box around the failure. SECONDARY FAILURE A secondary failure is a loss of an item of equipment or system resulting from a primary failure. Example: Loss of a pair of spoilers after a hydraulic system failure. The titles of the system pages corresponding to the secondary failures are indicated on the lower right part of the Engine/Warning Display (EWD) by an asterisk.

In Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) normal display, when there is a deviation of a value from its normal range, the related system page is displayed automatically to get the crew attention before this value gets to the warning or caution level. The affected parameter gives pulses. The related key light on the ECAM Control Panel (ECP) is on steady. The flashing symbol ADV is displayed on the lower part of the EWD when: - The crew did the manual selection of an SD page and there is an advisory on another SD page. - A failure is detected by the FWC and there is an advisory on another SD. - There are many advisories on different SD pages. When this occurs, the SD page which contains the first detected advisory is displayed. But the ADV symbol will flash to indicate to the crew that there are one or more advisories. Example: The ELEC page will be displayed if the IDG temperature increases above its normal value, but is still below the threshold of the warning. NOTE: An advisory can possibly lead to a failure, but not always. They are totally independent one from the other.

In flight the CFDS always operates in the normal mode. BITE Most aircraft system computers are equipped with a Built-In Test Equipment (BITE). The BITE, which is an electronic device (hard + soft), monitors permanently the system operation. When a failure is detected, it is stored in the BITE memory and is transmitted to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). Memorization of the 64 previous legs report is done by most of the BITEs. MENU MODE In this mode, the CFDIU dialogues with one computer at a time in order to read the contents of its BITE memory and to initiate various tests. This mode can only be selected on ground and interrupts the normal mode of operation. MEMORIZATION Memorization of failures is different when the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The full BITE functions and memorization operate in flight. On ground, the memorization is done only in the BITEs. The BITEs are provided with flight and ground memory zones. CFDIU The CFDIU centralizes all information concerning aircraft system failures. Reading or printing of all the failure information is done in the cockpit. The Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS = CFDIU + BITEs) functions are accessed through the MCDUs. The Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) send the ECAM messages to the CFDIU by ARINC429 data busses. The CFDIU will memorize these messages to generate the CURRENT LEG/LAST LEG ECAM REPORT. CFDS MODES Two CFDS modes are available: NORMAL and MENU modes. The MENU MODE is available only on ground.

After the flight, its title becomes LAST LEG REPORT. The purpose of this item is to present the failure messages, concerning all systems, occurred during the last/current flight. Each message contains the test of the failure, the ATA reference and the flight phase and time at which the failure occurred. A function correlates the \"SOURCE\" failure message with the \"resulting\" failure messages. SOURCE: Name of system affected by a failure. IDENTIFIER: Name of system affected by an external failure, which is correlated with the \"SOURCE\" failure. The CFDIU capacity for failure messages memorization is up to 40 lines. MESSAGES with the associated time, flight phase and ATA reference allow the maintenance crew to make a correlation for easier trouble-shooting. Beginning of PFR recording: - if flight number inserted prior to first engine start, first engine started + 3 minutes. - if not, aircraft speed > 80 knots. End of PFR recording: Aircraft speed \\< 80 knots + 30 seconds. LAST/CURRENT LEG ECAM REPORT A CURRENT LEG ECAM REPORT is elaborated during the flight. After the flight, its title becomes LAST LEG ECAM REPORT. The purpose of this item is to present the warning messages displayed on the upper ECAM display unit during the last/current flight. These are primary or independent warnings. Each message contains the ECAM warning, the ATA reference and the flight phase and time at which the warning was triggered. When several identical and consecutive warnings are transmitted, the CFDIU memorizes the first occurrence only and carries on counting with a maximum of 8. The occurrence counter is displayed between brackets at the end of the message. The CFDIU capacity for warning messages memorization is up to 40 lines.

Let us suppose that an Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) sensor failure has been detected and that systems A, B and C are affected by this failure. The Air Data System (ADS) will transmit an internal failure while systems A, B and C will transmit an external failure. FAILURE GRAVITY The failures are classified according to their importance: - class 1 failures are the most serious ones and require an immediate maintenance action subject to the Minimum Equipment List (MEL). - class 2 failures may have consequences if a second failure occurs. A class 2 failure must be repaired within 10 days. - class 3 failures can be left uncorrected until the next scheduled maintenance check.

These systems can memorize failures, which occurred in the last 64 flight legs. Type 1 systems are connected to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) via an ARINC 429 input bus and an ARINC 429 output bus. The discrete input permits to initiate the test or reset. The discrete output indicates if the system is OK or not. Example: Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU) SINGLE COMPUTER The first configuration in TYPE 1 is a single computer. Example: VHF 1 Transceiver. MULTI COMPUTER The second configuration in TYPE 1 includes several computers in the same aircraft system. One computer concentrates the maintenance data of the other computers. Example: Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGC) and Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC) with FMGC 1 as A, FMGC 2 as B and FAC 1 as C. DUPLICATED SYSTEM A duplicated system includes two different subsystems in the same computer. Example: Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) with ADR as subsystem 1 and IR as subsystem 2. TYPE 2 SYSTEM Type 2 systems memorize only failures from the last flight leg. The discrete signal is provided to initiate the test of the system.

GROUND/FLIGHT TRANSITION Transition to flight (Event 1) is defined at the soonest or at the latest depending on whether the flight number has been entered by the crew before take-off or not: - at the soonest: First engine start + 3 minutes if flight number entered prior to first engine start. - at the latest: Aircraft speed > 80 knots if flight number not entered prior to first engine start. At event \"1\", the leg number is incremented. IN FLIGHT PHASE From event 1 until aircraft speed has been below 80 knots for 150 seconds, type 1 and 3 systems are considered in flight. NOTE: As the leg has not changed, the content of the LAST LEG REPORT is identified in the PREVIOUS LEGS REPORT under the LEG -00. ON GROUND PHASE On ground, the system BITEs ensure: - detection (Type 1/2/3 systems) and memorization in their ground memory (Type 1/2 systems) of internal faults only, - transmission to the CFDIU of internal faults for monitoring and establishment of the AVIONICS STATUS. All Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) functions (e.g. PFR printing) are available on request through the MCDUs. NOTE: Type 2 systems are only considered in flight from 30 seconds after lift off up to touch down. In flight, the system Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) ensures: - detection (Type 1/2/3 systems) and memorization in their flight memory (Type 1/2 systems only as type 3 system BITEs do not have any memory) of internal and external faults, - transmission to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) of internal and external faults for memorization and establishment of the CURRENT LEG REPORT. This in flight phase corresponds to the Post Flight Report (PFR) recording time (Beginning and end of fault and Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) warning message memorization in the CFDIU).

The CFDIU permanently receives the UTC and the date from the aircraft clock and then sends these two parameters to all type 1 systems. The UTC and date are used by the system Built-in Test Equipments (BITEs) as well as the CFDIU for the various maintenance reports. MANAGEMENT The CFDIU manages failure information and adds data such as Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), DATE, ATA chapter, LEG, FLIGHT PHASE to elaborate reports. FAC CORRELATION If a computer internal failure is detected, the CFDIU achieves a correlation function that means it isolates or ignores the malfunctions of systems relating to this failure. Example: ADC FAILURE causes NO DATA FROM ADC in other computers. The Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) will present only the initial failure in the last leg report. The function IDENT will then present the systems affected by this failure. MONITORING The CFDIU scans permanently all input buses in order to detect a transmitted failure message. The CFDIU detects intermittent operation of the systems and adds INTM to the failure message. DETECTION The CFDIU can detect the nature of the failure by reading the ARINC words. Nature of failures: - internal (i.e. SDAC FAULT) - external (i.e. FWC 1: NO DATA FROM ADIRU1) - intermittent; (INTM) added - class 3; (CLASS 3) added. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD The CFDIU receives the flight number and city pair from the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). The city pair (FROM/TO airport) is sent to the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) and to the Data Management Unit (DMU)-part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU). The CFDIU counts the number (maximum 8) of identical and consecutive ECAM warning messages and records in the LAST LEG ECAM REPORT. FDIMU The CFDIU receives the aircraft identification from the Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU)-part of the FDIMU and sends this parameter to all type 1 systems. The CFDIU is used as an interface between the FDIU part and the Flight Warning Computer (FWC) to send some FDIU class 2 failures to the FWC in order to constitute the maintenance status. The CFDIU is used as an interface between the DMU-part of the FDIMU and the FWC to send some DMU class 2 failures. DMU class 2 failures are used for the maintenance status on the ECAM. FWC The CFDIU receives the flight phases and ECAM warnings from the FWC. The ECAM warnings are used by the CFDIU to generate the LAST or CURRENT LEG ECAM REPORT. Only PRIMARY Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 164 of 198 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY failures, INDEPENDENT failures and CLASS 2 failure messages (Maintenance status) are received. DMC The CFDIU receives the engine serial number from the Display Management Computer (DMC) and sends this parameter to the Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU). ATSU The ATSU receives the city pair from the FAC through the CFDIU. The CFDIU can send real time failures and ECAM warning messages to the ATSU. It can also send the Post Flight Report (PFR) to the ATSU at the end of the flight. EVMU The EVMU receives the engine serial number from the DMC through the CFDIU. The DMC receives it from the Engine Control Unit (ECU) for CFM engines, or Electronic Engine Control (EEC) for IAE and PW engines. ABNORMAL OPERATION CLOCK BACKUP If the aircraft clock fails, the CFDIU takes over and its internal clock sends UTC and date on the output bus to all type 1 systems. Upon power-on after A/C clock failure, the item GMT/DATE INIT is added to the CFDS menu. This option enables UTC and date initialization. CFDIU FAILURE When the CFDIU is affected by an internal failure, the message CFDIU is displayed on the ECAM MAINTENANCE STATUS page.

So the filtered Post Flight Report (PFR) contains only the messages needing a maintenance action. FILTER DATA BASE CUSTOMIZATION AND LOADING Using the feedback data from the airlines or the data from laboratory or flight tests, Airbus establishes, keeps up to date and transmits to the airlines a document called Service Information Letter (SIL) 00-028. SIL 00-028 consists of a \"spurious maintenance messages data base\". This is an envelope data base, including the spurious messages concerning every possible Part Number (PN) from every vendor. The airline is responsible for customizing this envelope data base to its fleet configuration using a compatible personal computer and dedicated software. The customized maintenance filter data base is first stored on a floppy disk, and then uploaded into the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) by means of the data loader.

The first is the Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) function. To obey the mandatory requirements of crash recording, the FDIU acquires and formats several important flight parameters and system data before it supplies them to the Solid State Flight Data Recorder (SSFDR). The linear accelerometer measures the acceleration of the A/C in all three axes. The System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC) digitizes the analog signal of the linear accelerometer and sends it to the FDIU. For maintenance and performance purposes, the optional Quick Access Recorder (QAR) records the same parameters as the SSFDR. The operation of the SSFDR is automatic. On the overhead panel, there is a GrouND ConTroL P/B, which is on the ReCorDeR panel. This P/B lets the SSFDR be supplied when the A/C is on ground for preflight checks before engine start or for tests and maintenance. On the center pedestal, there is a Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) EVENT P/B, which can be used to set an event mark on the SSFDR memory.

About the QAR/DAR, there are several vendors of optical disk storage media. The recorder is then called Optical QAR/DAR (OQAR/ODAR). There is also a version from Teledyne that includes a GSM module for data transmission called WQAR (Wireless GroundLink QAR). The FDIMU computer is in the aft avionics rack. The SSFDR is installed immediately above the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), in an unpressurized area of the rear fuselage. The SSFDR stores the data of the last 25 hours collected by the FDIU. The SSFDR stores these data in a solid state memory which is in a crash-and-fire-protected housing. The linear accelerometer is near the A/C center of gravity. It sends the accelerations in the 3 axes (pitch, roll and yaw) to the DFDRS.

An internal data-bus connects the two parts. The FDIU-part receives discrete and digital parameters and processes them. The functions of the FDIU-part are: - conversion, - comparison, - check and Built-In Test Equipment (BITE). The FDIU-part converts the input parameters into a numerical format for: - the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), - the optional Quick Access Recorder (QAR). -the Digital AIDS Recorder (DAR) The FDIU-part compares the data that it sends with the data recorded by the DFDR. The recorded data is transmitted back to the FDIU-part through the playback data bus. For PCMCIA recording function, data transmission from the FDIMU part to DMU part is given through an internal ARINC 429 data bus. The FDIU-part checks the integrity of the mandatory parameters during the flight. After the flight, engines shutdown, only the Linear Accelerometer (LA) signal check is done. The FDIU-part includes BITE and monitoring functions. DFDR (SDACs). The DFDR energization is controlled through the power interlock circuit. The underwater locator beacon installed on the front face of the DFDR gives the location of the recorder if the aircraft is immersed in water following an accident. The underwater locator beacon has a battery, which is activated by both fresh and salt water. QAR (OPTIONAL) The QAR stores the same data as the DFDR for on ground performance, maintenance or condition monitoring tasks. The data frames stored in the QAR are identical to the DFDR data frames. The QAR includes BITE functions. The QAR status signals (QAR MEDIA LOW, QAR FAIL) are sent to the lamps on its front face and to the CFDIU through the FDIU-part. The QAR energization is controlled through the power interlock circuit. If installed, the DAR records data in a formatted optical disk. LINEAR ACCELEROMETER The task of the LA is to measure the acceleration of the aircraft in all three axes. The range of measurement is: - vertical axis (Z): -3 to +6 g, - longitudinal axis (X): -1 to +1 g, - lateral axis (Y): -1 to +1 g. The LA generates an analog signal, which is sent to the SDACs. This signal is digitalized and sent to the FDIU-part through an ARINC 429 bus. The DFDR stores data, which the FDIU-part has collected during the last 25 hours. The data is recorded in data frames. Each frame contains data received during one second. The DFDR includes BITE functions. The DFDR status signal is sent to the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) through the FDIU-part and to the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) through the System Data Acquisition Concentrators Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 19/03/2025 13 FDIMU ...

The header data is taken at the time when the respective report is generated. Line CC contains the following data: - A/C ID: Aircraft identification (tail number), - DATE (month/day), - UTC: Universal Time Coordinated (hours/minutes/seconds), - FROM TO: City pair identification, - FLT: Flight number. The flight number is defined by up to 8 characters but only the last 4 numbers are used. Only numbers are possible and the not used positions are filled with zeros. E.g. Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) flight number AI067 is printed out 0067. REPORT VALUE PRESENTATION Each data line starts with two identification letters. The presentation of the values in the data lines is according to: - their sign: Negative values begin with \"N\" and, for positive values, \"N\" is replaced by \"0\" or another digit. - their operational range without decimal point as listed in the parameter list associated to the header and each report (for these lists, refer to Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 31-37-00). E.g.: The operational range of the Total Air Temperature (TAT) is from -60.0 to 99.9 \u00b0C. Therefore, -32.0 \u00b0C is printed out N320 and +26.5 \u00b0C is printed out 0265. In addition, a parameter, which is invalid or not updated, is replaced with \"_\" or \"X\" characters. NOTE: In this document, as well as in the AMM, generic symbols for the value fields are used: - \"1\" = 0 or 1, - \"A\" = Any character in the range from A. to.Z, - \"9\" = Any digit in the range from 0.to.9, - \"X\" = Any character or digit in the range from A.to.Z or 0.to.9. E.g.: TAT value is symbolized by \"X999\".

GENERAL A report is a comprehensive set of data related to a specific event (e.g. limit exceedance of engine parameters). The parameters contained in the reports are among the parameters provided with an alpha call-up (refer to Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 31-37-00 for the detailed parameter list associated to each report). The Data Management Unit (DMU) processes up to 23 different types of report: - 13 standard reports for basic aircraft, engine and APU monitoring. These reports have fixed trigger mechanism, fixed data collection and fixed output formatting. Nevertheless, certain constants and limits within fixed trigger logics are reprogrammable. Specific trigger conditions can be created for each report by means of the Ground Support Equipment (GSE). - up to 10 additional reports, numbered from 31 to 40, for airline specific investigation and trouble shooting. These reports are user programmable with the GSE for trigger conditions, data collection, report format and output destination. In addition to the automatic trigger logics, all the reports can be manually generated: - via MCDU, - via Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS) PRINT P/B (according to flight phase associations, if programmed), - via Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) (uplink request). Refer to AMM 31-37-00 for the detailed trigger logics associated to each report. A non-volatile memory for storage of at least 10 reports per different type of report is provided within the DMU. NOTE: S: - in this module, reports \\<01> to \\<11> are given for a CFM engine. They may be slightly different to your aircraft configuration.

ENGINE CRUISE REPORT \\<01> This report is a collection of data over a period of time in which the aircraft met the appropriate stability criteria. The required stability period is 100 seconds (programmable value). Basically, whatever the number of times the stability is detected, only one report is generated per flight leg. This report contains the data with the best engine quality number (QE) over the whole flight leg. If no stability is detected, then a report is generated with the following message in its last line: \"NO STABLE FRAME CONDITION\". NOTE: In case of ENGINE DIVERGENCE REPORT \\<09> generated, an engine cruise report is also generated when the first stability is detected, regardless of quality. The report mainly contains operating data of both engines, including vibration data. The report data are averages over the required stability period, except: - ESN, EHRS, ERT, ECYC: Engine general data (serial number, flight hours, running time, cycle), - AP: Autopilot status, - QE: Engine quality number used as stability indicator for this report (00: best stability, 99: worst stability), - OIQH: Oil consumption from the previous flight, - EVM, ECW1, SSEL: Engine vibration status word, engine control word, and status of Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) sensors, - data lines V3, V4: Averaged values taken from the last stable descent (i.e. descent of the last leg), - data lines V5, V6: Averaged values taken from the last stable climb (i.e. climb of the current leg). NOTE: For engine health monitoring purposes, 3 additional sensors can be optionally connected to the FADEC to permit recording of the following parameters: PS13 (fan tip discharge pressure), Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 19/03/2025 24 ENGINE CRUISE REPORT \\<01> Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 19/03/2025 25 INDIVIDUAL PRINT REPORT DESCRIPTION (3) CRUISE PERFORMANCE REPORT \\<02> This report is similar to ENGINE CRUISE REPORT \\<01> except that more information is provided about the aircraft. The following data is added: - QA: Aircraft quality number used as stability indicator for this report (00: best stability, 99: worst stability). - WFQ: Inner cell fuel quantity, - ELEV: Elevator position, - AOA, SLP: Corrected Angle-Of-Attack and side slip angle, - CFPG, CIVV: Last DMU calculated flight path acceleration and inertial vertical speed, - ROLL, YAW: Roll angle and body axis yaw rate (average), - THDG, LONP, LATP: True heading, longitude and latitude positions, - WS, WD: Wind speed and direction (average), - FT, FD: Fuel temperature and density (average), - Flight controls positions (average). E.g. RSP5: Roll spoiler 5 position. NOTE: Data lines X1, X4, X6 are issued from system 1 (e.g. FLAP system 1) or left (e.g. left spoiler 5) while data lines X2, X5, X7 are issued from system 2 or right. In addition, the trigger logic for this report differs a little bit from the logic for ENGINE CRUISE REPORT \\<01> and is performed independently (e.g. the required stability period can be different).

The reason for report generation is displayed (e.g. EXCESSIVE CABIN ALTITUDE). The report contains engine, aircraft and environmental data. Basically, up to 19 sets of parameters can be recorded at 15 seconds intervals before the event and 1 set at the event. The number of pre-event sets as well as the length of the pre-event interval (Y1) are programmable. In order to reduce the length of the report, a specific procedure is applied for report output: - the first pre-event dataset is generated completely as well as the at event dataset, - within the intermediate datasets, a line is only generated if the value of an included leading parameter has changed. E.g.: Cabin altitude (ZCB) is observed for changes in each Vx line and causes the print out of one line when the change limit is exceeded (i.e. +/- 100 feet).

A major module is the programming of the DMU functions. It mainly enables: - the adjustment of the standard reports (e.g. report limits), - the addition of customer reports (numbered from 31 to 40), - the addition of trigger conditions, - the configuration of the Smart Access Recorder (SAR) and Digital AIDS Recorder (DAR) recording channels (DAR is optionally installed). In particular, the GSE user has the possibility to program trigger conditions for: - standard reports (additional conditions), - programmable reports, - SAR, - DAR. This programming is made by means of logics defined in a specific language. In the example given here, report 31 is associated to logic 300 and will be triggered when the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) of engine 1 is greater than 850 \u00b0C for more than 3 seconds while in cruise flight phase. Once the programming is completed, another GSE module generates the associated database (i.e. setup/customer database). The database is stored on a floppy disk or a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) disk then transferred to the DMU through a Portable Data Loader (PDL) or the optional PCMCIA interface.

A first page is displayed with the DMU-part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) hardware (H/W) and S/W references: - P/N is the Part Number of the DMU, - D1 P/N is the Part Number of the operational S/W, - the 3 following items of information concern the setup/customer database: VVVV is the version number, LLLL is the revision level, DDMMYY is the generation date. A password, defined with the GSE, is required to access the following programming menus. REPORT INHIBIT Inhibition for all the reports of the printing and/or linking to the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU). The inhibition is effective until the next DMU power off. REPORT LIMITS Change, in a temporary way, of some report limits that are programmable by the GSE. The change is effective for a predefined number of days or legs (refer to the VALIDITY field). REPORT COUNTERS Setting of the report internal counters at their corresponding limit value. STATISTIC COUNTERS Initialization and visualization of the engine/APU hours and cycles. The DMU resets the engine/APU hours and cycles in case of engine/APU change (engine/APU serial number change detection). The menu then allows the correct values to be programmed for an engine or APU after it has been changed.

Each one of these responds through a separate data bus. NOTE: Only one MCDU can be used at a time for the Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS). The Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) and the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU)(if installed) have individual input/output buses. DAR INTERFACE BITE and DAR TAPE LOW information is delivered from the Digital AIDS Recorder (DAR) to the FDIMU (DMU-part) through discrete signals. BITE and DAR TAPE LOW information causes a class 2 message on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) maintenance status (\"DAR\") and two class 2 messages in the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) (DAR FAULT and DAR TAPE LOW). FDIU INTERFACE The Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) part of the FDIMU sends Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) parameters to the DMU-part of the FDIMU through an ARINC 429 bus so that they can be recorded on the DAR.

Each LGCIU in turn controls a complete gear cycle: one UP selection and one DOWN selection. The LGCIU in control is the active unit and the other is the standby unit. The active unit changes after each retract/extend cycle (when the L/G control lever is moved away from the DOWN position). If a failure occurs in the active LGCIU, the standby LGCIU becomes active. Duplicated sensors monitor the gear up and down positions, the door closed and open positions and the shock absorber compressed (ground signal) and fully extended (flight signal) positions. An interlock mechanism prevents unsafe retraction by locking the lever in the DOWN position when any shock absorber is compressed. The two systems are electrically segregated with different connections on the related selector valves. In case of failure, the gear can be mechanically extended from the cockpit by means of a gravity extension crank handle. After free fall extension, the L/G doors stay open and the L/G is locked down by the lockstays and springs. The normal extension and retraction control is available when the free-fall handle-assembly is put back to its initial position. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 6 of 177 SYSTEM OVERVIEW - EXTENSION/RETRACTION SYSTEM Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 7 of 177 LANDING GEAR SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) Normal braking is obtained when: - The green hydraulic pressure is available, - The Anti/SKID and Nose/Wheel Steering control switch is in the ON position, - The Parking Brake control switch is in the OFF position. Electrical control is obtained: - Through the pedals, - Automatically on the ground by the auto brake system, - In flight when the gear control lever is set to UP (in flight braking). BSCU computes the anti skid orders during normal braking. During alternate braking, BSCU computes the anti-skid orders and sends them to the ABCU for execution. If there is a BSCU failure or low pressure in the green and yellow hydraulic systems, the anti skid function is lost. The pilot must then refer to the triple pressure indicator to control the brake pressure and to prevent wheel locking. But the ABCU sets a maximum limit of 1000 PSI for the brake pressure. If there is a loss of the green and yellow hydraulic systems, braking is still available with the brake accumulator. With the accumulator pressure only, a maximum of 7 full brake pedal applications can be done. ALTERNATE BRAKING PARKING BRAKE The alternate brake system is energized by the yellow hydraulic system. A brake accumulator can supply hydraulic power for emergencies. The Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU) electrically controls the alternate braking with A/SKID or without A/SKID. The ABCU becomes active when the normal brake system is defective and/or the green system has a low hydraulic pressure. The data comes from the BSCU. The brake pedals give braking inputs, which are transmitted through the Alternate Brake Pedal Transmitter Unit to the ABCU. The ABCU will control the braking pressure. The braking, wheel speed and aircraft speed data are sent to the BSCU to calculate the A/SKID protection. The braking pressure is read on the triple indicator. The yellow hydraulic system or the brake accumulators supply brake pressure. Putting ON the parking brake deactivates the other braking modes and the A/SKID system. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) NORMAL BRAKING ANTI SKID FUNCTION The A/SKID function is a part of the BSCU and can be set to OFF with the A/SKID & N/W STeeRinG switch.

The steering system receives hydraulic pressure in the following conditions: - A/SKID & N/W STeeRinG switch is in ON position, - towing control lever is in normal position, - at least one ENG MASTER switch is ON, - aircraft is on ground. The steering system is controlled by the BSCU, which receives order from: - the steering hand wheels (orders added algebraically), - the rudder pedals, - the autopilot. When the rudder pedal disconnect pushbutton is pressed in, N/WS is disconnected from the pedals. The BSCU transforms the orders into N/WS angle. That angle has the following limits: - Ruder pedals: max 6 degrees, - Hand wheels: max 74 degrees. The NLG is equipped with Rotary Variable Differential Transducers (RVDTs), which are used as feedback sensors to the BSCU.

FAN The brake cooling system is a manually controlled system that decreases the temperature of the brakes when they are too hot. This optional system allows the brakes to be cooled in a short time period. One brake fan system with one BRK FAN HOT P/BSW is installed. TPIS The Tire Pressure Indicating System (TPIS) includes an electronic sensor on each wheel and a Tire Pressure Indicating Computer (TPIC). The TPIC controls and monitors the operation of the system and sends data to other interfaced systems. As an MPD item, the tire pressure can be checked through: - a pressure gage (tool), - or the ECAM WHEEL page.

Two lugs attach the body to the wing rear spar. When it is hydraulically supplied: - the piston rod extends to retract the MLG, - the piston rod retracts to extend the MLG. The torque links align the main fitting and the sliding tube, but let vertical movement between the parts occur. The slave link is mounted at the rear. SIDE STAY ASSEMBLY The main components of the side stay assembly are: - a basic side stay, - a lock stay, - a lock stay actuator, - two lock springs, - the proximity sensors and their related targets. The lock springs move the lock stay to an over center position during the extension cycle. TORQUE LINK DAMPER The torque link damper is a spring-centered, two-way hydraulic unit, which has its own hydraulic reservoir. Its function is to decrease the landing vibrations through the torque links. The hydraulic fluid contents of the damper are shown by the extension of the reservoir when it is pressurized. When the contents are correct, the \"FULL\" and \"REFILL\" level indications are in view. LOCK STAY The lock stay provides an over center stop and a geometric lock of the L/G. LOCK STAY ACTUATOR During MLG extension the two lock stay actuator ports are open to return; a restrictor controls the rate of MLG extension. It is pressurized to extend during MLG door closure until hydraulic pressure on the door close line is released. During MLG retraction, the hydraulic fluid retracts the piston which opens the over centered lock, to fold the side stay and the lock stay against the lock springs.

The fix fairing is attached to the gear on 5 points and is fully adjustable in vertical and horizontal directions. MAIN DOOR The main door is attached to the fuselage structure by two hinges and is operated by a hydraulic actuator. Attached to the forward end of the main door are the hydraulic actuator and an uplock roller that is used to keep the main door in the closed position. Installed on the rear end of the main door are steps, used for access to the gear well compartment. Two ramps are installed on the inside of the main door. These ramps make sure that the gear does not catch on the main door during a free-fall extension. Two proximity sensors and targets send the door open position signal of the main door to the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs). MLG DOOR UPLOCK The MLG door uplock is closed mechanically, locking the door in the closed position and hydraulically opened, releasing the door during normal extension and retraction sequences. The uplock can also be opened mechanically in free-fall extension and ground door opening. HINGED FAIRING The hinged fairing is attached to the wing skin by a single hinge and to the L/G by an adjustable tie-rod. The adjustable tie-rod causes the hinged fairing to follow the L/G during the L/G extension and retraction.

They are located on the MLG strut. B2 SCOPE ABCU CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. PEDALS The pedals give mechanical inputs to the normal brake pedal Transmitter (XMTR) unit, and to the alternate pedal XMTR unit for manual normal braking and alternate braking. BRAKE PEDALS XMTR UNITS The brake pedal XMTR units transform the mechanical input from the right and left pedals into electrical signals which are sent to the Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU) in normal braking and to the Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU) in alternate braking. BSCU The BSCU controls normal braking, auto braking as well as anti-skid operation during normal and alternate braking. SELECTOR VALVE The selector valve is an on/off valve. When normal braking is applied, the BSCU first energizes the selector valve, this lets full green pressure supply the normal servovalves. NORMAL SERVOVALVES LANDING GEAR PANEL A landing gear panel is composed of a toggle switch for anti-skid and nose wheel steering function inhibition. There are also three P/BSWs for AUTO-BRAKE selection. The BSCU and ABCU receive inputs from the landing gear panel. TRIPLE INDICATOR A triple indicator gives pressure indication. The top needle supplies the alternate breaking accumulator supply pressure. The bottom needles supply pressure sent to the left and right brakes units (indication available only if ALTERNATE BRAKING is active or PARKING BRAKE is set to on). WHEELS The normal servovalve has a dual function: it regulates braking pressure, which depends on BSCU braking orders, and anti-skid control pressure delivered to the brakes. This servovalve with direct control laws is fully Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) The ABCU controls and monitors the alternate braking system with and without anti-skid protection. The ABCU is automatically activated if: - the anti-skid is faulty, - the A/SKID switch is selected to OFF (BSCU OFF) - the BSCU is not serviceable (both system 1 & 2 have failed), - the normal braking has failed, - the pressure downstream the selector valve drops below a given threshold, - only the batteries supply the A/C. Each main wheel has multidisc carbon brakes. Each main wheel rotation speed given by a tachometer is sent to the BSCU for anti-skid computation. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 90 of 177 SHUTTLE VALVES The shuttle valves give the hydraulic priority for brake supply to the parking brake. PARKING BRAKE CONTROL VALVE The parking brake electrical control valve is operated by the parking brake handle. When it is open, a signal is sent to the BSCU and the ABCU in order to override all other braking modes. If the normal braking system is available and, if the pedals are depressed when the PARK BRK is ON and the pressure commanded by the pedal deflection exceeds the pressure delivered by the park brake system, the normal system will send a complement of pressure to the normal set of pistons to reach the commanded value. ACCUMULATOR The brake accumulator is supplied from the yellow hydraulic system and can provide pressure to the alternate brake system.

AUTOBRAKE MODES The AUTO BRaKe panel is used to select the desired deceleration rate of the system. MAXimum mode is normally selected for take-off: in the event of an aborted take-off, maximum braking pressure is sent to the normal brake pistons as soon as ground spoilers deployment order is present. MEDium or LOw modes are selected for landing: progressive pressure is sent to the brakes, for respectively 2 or 4 seconds after the ground spoilers deployment order. ADIRS The Air Data Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) signals the aircraft deceleration rate to the Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU) to be compared with the selected deceleration mode for braking computation. A/SKID & N/W STRG SWITCH ACTIVATION The automatic braking system is activated by at least 2 of the 3 ground spoiler extension signals coming from the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs). The DECEL light comes on green when actual aircraft deceleration is 80 % of the selected rate (LO and MED modes) or 0.27 g (MAX mode). DISARMING The autobrake is disarmed by: - releasing the selected P/B out, - loss of one or more arming conditions, - applying sufficient force to the pedals when autobrake is operating, - ground spoilers retraction. If ground spoilers are extended again, autobrake will be activated as well. The A/SKID & N/W STRG switch activates the anti-skid system and enables autobrake arming. ON: anti-skid (A/SKID) and nose wheel steering (N/W STRG) are available and autobrake can be armed provided the green pressure is valid. If green pressure drops: - yellow pressure takes over automatically, anti-skid is available, nose wheel steering is still available, - and autobrake cannot be armed. OFF: anti-skid, nose wheel steering, normal brake and autobrake are lost. ARMING The autobrake system is armed if one of the three modes P/B (LO, MED or MAX) is pressed in and the following conditions are met: - green pressure available, - BSCU electrically powered, - no failure in the normal braking system.

The Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU) controls the alternate braking components during alternate braking with or without A/SKID. The ABCU determines the braking orders according to the brake pedal deflections measured by the Brake Pedal Transmitter Unit (BPTU). The ABCU combines these braking orders with the antiskid orders sent by BSCU. The ABCU send the braking orders, combined or not with antiskid control orders, to the alternate brake DDVs. BSCU The Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU) gives the A/SKID control during normal and alternate braking by either system 1 or 2 of the BSCU. Systems 1 and 2 have independent power supplies, and at each power up, the first system supplied takes control. If the two systems are supplied simultaneously. System 1 has priority and system 2 is in standby. System on standby will take control when L/G control lever is placed in the DOWN position. SV AND DDV The normal SV is connected to the BSCU. The two coils of the normal SV are connected to systems 1 and 2 respectively. The alternate DDV is connected to the ABCU which controls it. PRINCIPLE ADIRU The speed of each main gear wheel, given by a tachometer, is compared with the A/C speed supplied by the Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs). A reference speed is determined by the BSCU from the longitudinal deceleration given by ADIRUs 1, 2 or 3. When the speed of a wheel decreases below 0.87 times the reference speed, brake release orders are given to that wheel to maintain the wheel deceleration rate at that value. The required reference speed during braking is directly obtained from the average between the values from the three ADIRUs. In case the ADIRU data is not valid, the reference speed is equal to the maximum of either MLG wheel speeds. A/C deceleration is limited to 1.7 m/s\u00b2 (5.6 ft/s\u00b2). REGULATION The operational amplifier compares the calculated reference speed with the speed of the decelerating wheel. The operational amplifier supplies numerical values which are converted into current to supply the coil of the normal Servovalve (SV) and sends it to the Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU).

ADIRU Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 98 of 177 BRAKE SYSTEM OPERATION (3) GENERAL The hydraulic braking architecture is shown with all components. NOTE: Note that only their main functions are shown. NORMAL BRAKING The hydraulic braking operation is identical for automatic braking, manual braking and in-flight braking. NOTE: Note that during in-flight braking, Anti-Skid (A/SKID) function is inhibited by the Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU). Normal braking and A/SKID regulations are electrically controlled by the BSCU. OPERATION: The selector valve is energized. The normal brake servovalves supply a pressure which depends on the control current delivered by the BSCU. The manifold comprises the servovalves, the pressure transducers and the hydraulic fuses. The hydraulic fuses stop the flow in the lines in case of leakage. During manual braking, the brake pedal transmitter units provide an artificial feel at the pedals. The artifical feel at the pedals is provided by means of 2 sets of spring rods, that are as well putting the pedals to its initial position when the force is removed. A pressure transducer downstream of the normal brake selector valve sends the hydraulic pressure information to the BSCU and the ALTN Braking Control Unit (ABCU). A pressure lower than 90 bar or all other normal braking failure lets the ABCU activate the ALTN braking mode.

The yellow High Pressure (HP) system supplies the ALTN braking. A pressure transducer informs the ABCU in case of yellow LP. When the normal braking is faulty or the pressure downstream the normal selector valve drops, the BSCU informs the ABCU, which becomes active. OPERATION: The orders are entered through the pedals and an ALTN brake pedal transmitter unit transmits the orders to the ABCU. The ABCU opens the ALTN brake selector valve. The current sent to the Direct Drive Valves (DDVs) is proportional to the pressure applied on the brake pedals. The pressure output from each DDV goes through its related shuttle valve and the hydraulic fuse. Each ALTN brake manifold comprises one alternate DDV and one hydraulic fuse. One ALTN brake pressure transducer is installed at each alternate brake manifold, downstream of the hydraulic fuse. They transmit brake pressure data to the ACCU/PRESS triple indicator to ABCU and the BSCU. The BSCU uses it for the A/SKID function. If a wheel starts to skid, the BSCU sends a signal to the ABCU to reduce the current in the related DDV. The hydraulic fuse stops the flow in the line in case of leakage.

Moreover, in the event of insufficient yellow hydraulic pressure, the brake accumulator supplies the brakes (emergency braking). Thus, the ABCU inhibits the antiskid protection and maintains a predetermined level of braking even when the brake pedals are fully released. This is to prevent the loss of hydraulic fluid from the accumulator. OPERATION: braking orders are sent to the ABCU via the ALTN brake pedal transmitter unit. The ABCU energizes the ALTN brake selector valve and applies to the DDV a current proportional to the ALTN brake pedal transmitter unit signals. To reduce the risk of tire burst when A/SKID is not available, the ABCU limits the brake pressure to 1000 psi (70 bar). To release this limitation, the ALTN brake pressure transducers measure the brake pressure and send this data to the ABCU. These transducers give visual indication on the yellow ACCU/PRESS triple indicator. A third set of potentiometers in the ALTN brake pedal transmitter unit supplied by the HOT BATTERY BUS lets the ABCU brake the A/C during towing operation.

OPERATION: When the parking brake handle is set to the \"ON\" position, the shuttle valves give the hydraulic priority for the brake supply to the parking brake. When the parking brake control valve is open, a signal is sent to the BSCU and the ABCU in order to override all other braking modes. If the brake accumulator pressure becomes low when the parking brake is on, normal braking using the pedals can be applied to stop the A/C. When the pedal deflection order exceeds the pressure delivered by the parking brake, the BSCU sends a complement of pressure to the normal set of pistons to reach the commanded value.

CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. BYPASS VALVE GENERAL The bypass valve interconnects the two chambers of the steering actuator in the event of hydraulic system depressurization. The bypass valve opens if the pressure exceeds 273 bar (4000 psi). The nose wheel steering system is supplied by the yellow hydraulic system and is composed of several components which are described in detail in the following sections. ANTI-SHIMMY VALVES There is one anti-shimmy valve per steering actuator chamber. SWIVEL SELECTOR VALVE STEERING ACTUATOR The swivel selector valve is installed co-axially with respect to the L/G retraction axis and provides hydraulic power supply when the gear is extended. When the gear starts to retract, the swivel selector valve cuts the hydraulic power supply. The steering actuator drives the rotating tube, which is part of the NLG structure, via a rack-and-pinion assembly. CHECK VALVE/FILTER A 40-micron filter and a check valve are installed in the hydraulic power supply line followed with a second check valve mounted between the filter and the servo valve. ACCUMULATOR The anti-shimmy accumulator supplies pressurized fluid in case of cavitation in one of the two chambers of the steering actuator. The accumulator can supply fluid pressurized up to 15 bar (220 psi). BLEED SCREW SERVO VALVE A bleed screw allows bleeding and depressurization of the hydraulic block. The servo valve is of the deflection-jet type. It is equipped with a Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT) sensor which detects the position of the slide valve. The LVDT provides position feedback for the steering control. NOTE ADJUSTABLE DIAPHRAGM The adjustable diaphragms are used to adjust the flow to each actuating cylinder chamber and consequently the wheel steering speed. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Airbus has been reported swivel joint ruptures of the MLG lockstay actuator hoses due to stress corrosion.

After wheel speed computation the BSCU energizes wheel speed relays. These relays send a signal to the pack controllers for pack ram air inlet operation during take-off and landing phases. SEC Two of the three ground spoilers extended signals coming from the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) must be present to enable automatic braking. LGCIU Inputs from both Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) serve for braking and nose wheel steering functions control logic. LGCIUs receive wheel speed indications. These signals are used for BITE inhibition. ELAC The link between the Braking Steering Control Unit (BSCU) and the ELevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) serves for nose wheel steering purposes with orders coming from rudder pedals and autopilot. BTMU The BSCU changes analog signals from the Brake Temperature Monitoring Units (BTMUs) into digital ones for temperature indication on the lower ECAM display unit. TACHOMETERS Tachometers send wheel speed values to the BSCU enabling reference speed computation and also to the SECs for ground spoilers extension logic.

In order to test the alternate braking capability, the BSCU sends functional test orders to the Alternate Braking Control Unit (ABCU) in predetermined test sequences. For safety reasons, these tests are inhibited by the main landing gear compressed position signal by the ABCU. Moreover the ABCU sends alternate Brake Pressure Transmitter Unit (BPTU) failure and alternate system status to the BSCU.

CFDIU The BSCU sends BITE data to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) by a bi-directional ARINC 429 link. This link transmits the failure messages. SDAC The System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) receive ARINC 429 bus signals for acquisition and processing of all the data necessary for the generation of warnings. FDIMU The Flight Data Interface Unit (FDIU) part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) collects braking system data like braking pressure, braking pedal position, auto brake status and maintenance data in order to send them to the flight data recorder. The Digital Management Unit (DMU) part of the FDIMU receives maintenance data for reports used in preventive maintenance. FMGC The BSCU sends 4 availability discretes to the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs). This is to meet the safety requirements of a category 3B landing.

PRESSURE TRANSDUCER A pressure transducer installed in the wheel rim measures the pressure of each tire. The pressure transducer gives a DC signal from 0 to 100mV in proportion to the pressure. INTERFACES The signal from the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) is used to change the tire pressure threshold for on-ground or in-flight warnings. ENGINE OIL PRESSURE SWITCHES The engine oil pressure signal is sent to the TPIS detection unit for information concerning engine running. ROTATING MECHANISM The rotating mechanism serves to transmit the tire pressure signal from the wheel to the axle. The rotating transformer also provides the necessary power supply for the electronic module and the pressure transducer in the form of a 3125Hz signal. NOTE: Tire pressure warnings are only memorized by the BITE when at least one engine is running to prevent false warnings during wheel change. ELECTRONIC MODULE The integrated electronic module amplifies the signal from the pressure transducer and changes the voltage into frequency by means of a converter. The voltage to frequency converter gives a signal which varies from 50 to 100kHz for a pressure range from 0 to 300 psi. ROTATING TRANSFORMER The rotating transformer transmits the tire pressure value from the wheel to the detection unit. DETECTION UNIT The detection unit comprises a microprocessor which provides data processing and distribution of each tire pressure including normal and abnormal pressure signals for ECAM indication and Centralized Fault Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) Display System (CFDS) monitoring. The TPIS detection unit permanently performs a test of the unit itself, the rotating mechanism and the pressure transducer. The test is only stopped for data processing and distribution. NOTE: A number of cases have been reported where the tachometers were cross connected on the landing gear. The consequence is the loss of anti-skid on one wheel and loss of the braking pressure on the adjacent one if anti-skid is active. This can lead to reduced controllability on ground and thus potentially to runway excursion. A new heat shrink colour coding of the tachometer harnesses has been implemented in order to enhance identification of the tachometer harness to prevent cross connection: CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 127 of 177 PURPOSE ...

As a Maintenance Planning Document (MPD) task, the check of the Main Landing Gear (MLG) shock absorber charge is done by measuring and recording the dimension H. Correct values will be found in the AMM and instructions are given on the MLG strut cylinder. A check of the nitrogen fill pressure is performed via the accumulator pressure gage on the yellow brake accumulator. The relief valve allows the hydraulic depressurization of the accumulator to check its nitrogen pre-charge as required by the MPD. MLG SPARE SEAL ACTIVATING VALVE Each MLG fitting has a spare seal-activating valve. This valve is used to isolate the bottom gland seal if a hydraulic leak occurs from that position. Closing the spare seal-activating valve will isolate the bottom gland seals and activate the top gland seals. NOTE: It is recommended that all gland seals on the applicable MLG be replaced at subsequent scheduled maintenance. NLG SHOCK ABSORBER As a MPD task, the check of the NLG shock absorber charge pressure is performed by measuring and recording the dimension H on the NLG strut. Correct values of this dimension are given in the AMM and on the NLG servicing chart. If nitrogen refilling is necessary, it can be done via the charging valve.

The forward point \"A\" is located forward of the nose landing gear. The points \"B\" are located outboard of the engine pylons. A safety stay must be positioned at the rear of the aircraft after jacking to stabilize the aircraft. You can lift the aircraft at the forward jacking point only, with the wheels of the main landing gear on the ground. When the aircraft is weighed on landing gear jacks the following jacking points must be used to lift it. - 2 jacking points located in the main landing gear, - 1 jacking point located in the nose landing gear. The LH, RH and nose jack pad adapters are different and must not be interchanged. Those for the A321 are also different from those of the other aircraft and must not be interchanged. LIMITATIONS The open air jacking operation is limited if the wind velocity exceeds permissible values which depend on aircraft gross weight and center of gravity position. In any condition, the aircraft must be pointing upwind. PRECAUTIONS Before you lift the aircraft, you must be sure that the ground safety-locks are in position on the landing gears and the weight of fuel is applied equally on the two sides of the aircraft centerline. The three jacks must be operated together. When the jacking operation is completed, install the safety stay to make the aircraft stable. Do not use the safety stay to lift the aircraft. The safety stay must be removed for the gear swing. JACKING POINTS Put jacking pads below the jacking points to apply the loads equally. NOTE: It is necessary to use the jack pad adapters when the aircraft is put on jacks.

Load cells on each jack or platform scales are used for weighing. QUICK LEVELING PROCEDURE WITH THE ADIRU First, follow the Inertial Reference (IR) alignment procedure. Then on the MCDU scratchpad the alpha call-up code has to be entered: - PTCH for the pitch angle to do a check of the longitudinal alignment, - ROLL for the roll angle to do a check of the transverse alignment. To start this procedure, first of all the aircraft must be lifted. After that, read the pitch and roll angles in the MCDU scratchpad. Then operate the hydraulic jack below the wing to get the transverse alignment. Then operate the forward hydraulic jack to get the longitudinal alignment. When you have done the longitudinal alignment, do a check of the transverse alignment.

The A/C may be towed or pushed back: - at maximum ramp weight, - with the engines shut down or running at idle. To begin the procedure, make sure: - that the safety devices are installed on the landing gears (L/G), - the wheel chocks are in place, - and check if the parking brake is ON. Do not tow the A/C if the dimension H is more than 300 mm (11.8 in). If you do, you can cause damage to the internal centering cams of the nose landing gear (NLG). Referring to your A/C maintenance manual, make sure that the A/C is stable. Let us suppose that this procedure has been correctly done. During this procedure, depending on the configuration you are in, the A/C needs to be energized either by using the APU, a specific ground cart, an engine running, or by using the tractor itself. Let us suppose that the A/C is already energized and the EIS start procedure done. Outside, on the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, set the ground-towing control lever to the towing position and install the pin. In the cockpit, - on the upper ECAM page, the \"Nose.WHEEL STEERinG DISConnected\" message comes into view on the memo page. - check on the Yellow brake-pressure triple-indicator that the accumulator pressure pointer is in the green range. We recommend pressurizing the yellow hydraulic system using the yellow electrical pump, thus, the braking system will be more efficient and safer. Now, we have to install the tow bar. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD CAUTION: Caution: make sure that the tow bar has: - a damping system - a calibrated shear pin - two calibrated turn shear pins. This is to prevent high loads causing damage to the L/G. Refer to your A/C maintenance manual for the calibration of these pins. On the NLG, install the tow bar on the tow fitting and connect the tow bar to the tractor. CAUTION: Caution: put the parking brake control switch in the off position before you tow or push back the A/C. This is to prevent high loads causing damage to the NLG. On the Yellow brake-pressure triple-indicator, the brakes pressure pointers go down. In the cockpit, set the lighting system: - set the exterior light navigation and logo switch to ON. - at night, set the interior light dome switch to bright and if the anti-collision lighting is necessary for the local airport regulations or the airline procedures, set the exterior light beacon switch to ON. On the VHF system: - in order to communicate with the control tower during towing operations, release out the VHF pushbutton switch and select the control tower frequency on the radio management panel. - in order to communicate with the ground mechanics, on the audio control panel, set the interphone radio switch to the interphone position and release out the interphone reception pushbutton. For safety reasons, a distance of 3 meters (10 ft) must be kept clear around the nose wheels, tow bar and tractor when the aircraft moves. Towing speed limitation depends on the position of the passenger/crew and cargo doors. For these speed limitations refer to your A/C maintenance manual. Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 152 of 177 The maximum permitted steering angle on each side of the A/C centerline is 95 degrees. At this point, be sure that all warnings and cautions of your A/C maintenance manual procedure and previous precautions are applied. Now, the A/C can be towed slowly and smoothly. Two other persons have to monitor the wing tips during the towing operation and one person is required in the cockpit in order to operate the brakes. When you complete the towing operation, make sure that the nose wheels are aligned with the A/C centerline. Inform the cockpit to apply the parking brake, and check that the parking brake light is ON on the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box. Put the wheel chocks in position. Disconnect the tow bar from the nose gear fittings. On the nose wheel steering deactivation electrical-box, remove the safety pin and set the ground-towing control lever to the normal position. At the same time, in the cockpit, on the ECAM memo display the message \"N.WHEEL STEERG DISC\" disappears. On the lighting system: - reset the exterior light beacon and navigation & logo switches to OFF. - reset the interior light dome switch to OFF. On the communication system: - cut the cockpit/control tower VHF link by pressing in the VHF pushbutton on the radio management panel. - reset the interphone radio switch to the neutral position. Depressurize the yellow hydraulic system, do the EIS stop procedure and de-energize the A/C electrical circuits.

A relay (relative to system) or internal contacts (case of P/BSWs position indication) control the lighting of each ANN LT. Four different busbars: - AC1 supply with 103XP, - AC2 supply with 202XP, - 115 VAC STATic INVerter bus with 901XP, - ESSential supply with 801XP, supply the ANN LTs with 5 VAC-400 Hz through the transformers. In the case of emergency supply only busbar 901XP is serviceable. The power supply is composed of: - busbar 103XP (AC1) which supplies transformer 37LP through the circuit breaker 26LP located on the circuit breaker panel 122VU, - busbar 202XP (AC2) which supplies transformer 36LP through the circuit breaker 27LP located on the circuit breaker panel 122VU, - busbar 801XP supplies transformer 31LP through the circuit breaker 29LP located on the overhead panel 49VU, - busbar 801XP supplies transformer 35LP through the circuit breaker 29LP and the busbar 901XP supplies emergency through the circuit breaker 28LP located on the circuit breaker panel 122VU, - busbar 206PP supplies the ANN LT test relay coils. TRANSFORMERS COCKPIT ANN LT SWITCH There are four transformers; each is supplied with 115 V-400 Hz. Each one is connected to a different busbar. They supply: - 5 VAC-400 Hz for the ANN LTs installed on the overhead panel and on the instrument panel, - 6.3 V voltage (full wave rectified) to supply the AUTO LAND, MASTER WARNING and CAUTION lights and Audio Control Panels (ACPs). The secondary winding of each transformer has: - 7 outputs of 5 VAC each mounted in parallel; each one is protected by a delayed action fuse set at 4 A, - 2 outputs of 6.3 V each protected by the same type of fuse. The primary winding of each transformer has two inputs to get the correct dimming level (DIMmed position). If the 115 V supply is switched over to either input we obtain at the secondary winding: - the 5 VAC (BRighT position) or 3 VAC (DIM position), - the 6.3 VAC (BRT position) or 4.3 VAC (DIM position) for rectified voltages. A switch with 3 positions (DIM, BRT, TEST) is located on the overhead control and indicating panel 25VU. The crew uses this switch to dim the cockpit annunciator lights or to test their operation.

Some DEUs are used for the light system, they are called type \"A\" DEUs. Signals from the FAP are processed by the DIRs to control the cabin lights. The DIRs transmit these signals to each DEU. The passenger reading lights can be controlled with buttons on the Passengers Service Unit (PSU) and through the FAP. The reading lights are not adjustable because the Light Emitting Diode (LED) light diffusion angle is sufficient. Reading lights are supplied by the active CIDS DIR via DEUs A and Passenger Interface and Supply Adapters (PISAs) installed in the Passenger Service Units (PSUs). The test of the passenger reading lights can be done either via the MCDU of from the FAP. CABIN GENERAL LIGHTS The related DEUs control the cabin fluorescent lamps according to the selection on the FAP. The FAP controls the DEUs via the CIDS DIRs to give brightness (BRT) levels which are: 100% BRT, 50% BRT (Dimming 1), 10% BRT (Dimming 2) or different lighting scenarios with brightness levels between 100% to 5% for their related window and/or ceiling lights. The cabin fluorescent lamps have Advanced Integrated Ballast Units (AIBUs). The ballast units receive FAP commands via CIDS DIRs and DEUs A for brightness level control. This is according to different lighting scenarios programmed in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM) flash card. The ballast units are designed to get a continuous dimming from 100% to 5% light BRT level. There is one reading light for each passenger seat. ENTRY LIGHTS The related DEUs control the entry fluorescent lamps according to the FAP selection. The FAP controls the DEUs via the CIDS DIRs in order to give BRT levels (100%, 50% or 10%). ATTENDANT WORK LIGHTS The attendant work lights are controlled by buttons in the attendant area or the FAP. The attendant work lights have a LED technology, and are supplied by the active CIDS DIR via DEUs A and stand alone PISAs. The test of the attendant work lights can be done either via the MCDU or from the FAP. NOTE: Note: The Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of LED reading lights is 100,000 flight hours. Thus, there is no replacement procedure apart from replacing the complete light assembly. Cabin signs must be replaced if three or more LEDs have failed (de-graded performance). If a full failure of the FAP and/or CIDS occurs or cabin decompression occurs, the entrance lighting comes on automatically to 100% BRT level. NOTE: If the engines are running and the cockpit door is open, the CIDS directors signal the DEU of the left forward entry light to set the intensity to 10%.

The CIDS gives up to 6 pre-programmed lighting scenarios defined in NIGHT and DAY modes for the entire cabin and/or per cabin zone. As an example, these scenarios can be used for the different cabin services (e.g. Wake up, Sleep, Video, Dinner,...) or flight phases (e.g. Boarding, Take/Off, Landing,...). All these scenarios are assigned in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The GENERAL CABIN SETTINGS keys are used for the cabin lighting ON/OFF control and cabin lighting settings, the selections can be applied to individual class zones by selecting the class Select key. Continuous dimming for each cabin zone is possible by using \"+\" or \"-\" keys on the FAP CABIN LIGHTING page. The MAINTenance key is for lavatory light full brightness.

When the 28V DC ESS SHED BUS voltage is not available, the batteries of all EPSUs supply the emergency lighting system for at least 10 minutes. The batteries are no longer charged. TEST Each EPSU has a test circuit which tests the condition of the battery unit, the logic unit and the related loads. If a fault is detected it is reported to CIDS. An EPSU SYStem TEST can be triggered from MCDU or CFDS Emulation on FAP. The EPSU BATtery CAPacity TEST can only be triggered from MCDU. The duration of this test is around 3 hours. An individual test on each EPSU must be carried out when the tests through MCDU or CFDS Emulation on FAP fail. This isolated test starts when you push the TEST P/B on the EPSU ON POSITION In the ON position the emergency lighting system comes on, as if the EMERgency P/B on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) was pushed.

ADM INPUTS The ADM inputs are one pressure input and several discrete inputs. The ADMs are identical and fully interchangeable. The discrete inputs determine the ADM location and the type of pressure data (Pitot or static) provided to the ADR. The power supply for the ADM is a 13.5V DC supply from the associated ADIRU. ADM OUTPUTS The ADM output is an ARINC bus, which gives digital pressure information, type of pressure, ADM identification and BITE status to the ADIRU.

PRINCIPLE Various instruments and systems receive data from the ADIRS for inertial and air data display: - the PFDs, - the NDs, - the ECAM SD, - the Digital Distance and Radio Magnetic Indicator (DDRMI). The ADIRUs transmit air data, attitude and navigation parameters to various user systems. As an example, the ADIRS provides: - barometric altitude data to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system for mode C and S, - data to the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) for computation of various characteristic speeds, - data to the Weather Radar (WXR) system for antenna attitude stabilization. Basically, ADIRU 1 is associated with systems 1 and the DDRMI, ADIRU 2 with systems 2, and ADIRU 3 is in standby. ADIRU 3 can substitute either system, for this purpose it has interfaces with the three Display Management Computers (DMCs). If an Air Data Reference (ADR) or an Inertial Reference (IR) fails, the AIR DATA or ATTitude HeaDinG selectors enable the crew to use ADR 3 or IR 3. The manual switching is mainly performed to recover displays. The computers select their inputs according to the switching for consistency of computation and display. NOTE: The ADIRU data sent to the ECAM SD are Static Air Temperature (SAT), Total Air Temperature (TAT) and International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

ALIGNMENT OF THE IRS The Flight Management Guidance and Envelope System (FMGES) uses the reference point coordinates of the departure airport to align the Inertial Reference System (IRS). It automatically finds these coordinates in the database after the operator enters a company route or an origin-destination city pair and pushes the ALIGN IRS key on the MCDU. The operator can manually adjust these coordinates to the gate position. The time necessary for a full alignment is 10 minutes. It is necessary to do a specific alignment procedure between 73\u00b0and 82\u00b0 north or south (refer to FCOM documentation). The alignment procedure is not possible at more than 82\u00b0 north or south.

With this initialization by GPS, no operator action is necessary. Less than 1 minute after the ADIRS is set to NAV, the INIT page displays the GPS position, but does not display the ALIGN IRS prompt message. The time necessary for a full alignment will be between 5 and 10 minutes in relation to the local latitude and a maximum of 17 minutes between 73\u00b0 and 82\u00b0 north or south. If the operator enters a company route or an origin-destination city pair, the INIT page displays the departure airport reference-point coordinates, and the IRS ALIGN prompt message comes into view. If the prompt key is not pushed, the ADIRS will be aligned on the GPS position. If the prompt key is pushed, the ADIRS will be aligned on the reference point coordinates of the departure airport. The operator can also use the MCDU latitude and longitude keys of the INIT page to change the given aircraft position. This will cause the ALIGN IRS prompt key to come into view. This prompt key must then be pushed.

Step input threshold: 0.5 ft/s, 30 seconds after the detection of movement, and if no other movement occurs, a 10-minute alignment starts. NOTE: Note: If the test is done two times, one after the other, and the test results are not correct, the IRS detects a fault situation (indications on MSU and EWD). If this occurs, set the ADIRUs to OFF, wait for 20 seconds and try to do a full alignment again. NOTE: Note: It is not necessary to re-initialize the position if already entered. TEST OF STORED POSITION When the initial position is entered, the ADIRUs do a check to find if this position is within a threshold of the computed position, which was stored at the last ADIRU shutdown. If not, an MCDU message \"REALIGN IRS\" is displayed to enter the present position. Test threshold: 1\u00b0 for latitude and longitude during alignment, 0.5\u00b0 during fast realignment. NOTE: Note: If the result of the test for the new position is not correct, the system waits for another position entry. If the same position (out of the threshold) is entered two times, the ADIRUs accept it as a deliberate choice. TEST OF COMPUTED LATITUDE At the end of the alignment, the ADIRUs do a check to find if the entered latitude is within a threshold of the self-computed latitude.

To avoid \"cross connection\" the pressure connectors are keyed and color-coded: Red for total pressure and yellow for static pressure. The electrical connector is for power supply, pin programming and systems interface. The normal power supply is 28V DC from the DC ESSential BUS. If DC ESS BUS is not available, a back-up of 28V DC is automatically supplied from the HOT BATtery BUS if airspeed is greater than 50 kts. All the data received and computed by the ISIS is sent to the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) through one ARINC 429 high-speed bus for inertial data transmission and one low-speed bus for anemometric data transmission. One discrete output is used for fault/healthy indication. In case of a fatal failure of the ISIS the red message OUT OF ORDER associated with the related fault code is shown. PERIPHERALS INPUTS The ISIS receives data from several systems. Via ARINC 429 buses the ISIS is connected to: - the Instrument Landing System (ILS) or Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) for localizer and glide slope signals, - the Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) 1 and 3 for the reception of the optional magnetic heading data. An ARINC 429 input is reserved as system provision (not shown). Through discrete inputs the ISIS receives signals: - from the ATTitude HeaDinG selector switch on the SWITCHING panel for selection of active ADIRU 1 (normal mode) or 3 (alternate mode), - for the display of the optional reference BAROmetric pressure in inches of mercury in addition to the reference BARO in hectopascals, - for the display of the optional altitude value in meter in addition to the altitude value in feet, - which enable to change the basic aircraft symbol by the V-bars symbol as an option, - for the ISIS indicator face tilting (4 discretes), - for parity control of all the discretes.

In case of failure of two ADIRUs, the two FMGCs use only the operative ADIRU. This ADIRU receives data from its own side GPS (e.g. ADIRU 1. GPS 1). GENERAL The Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) system includes: - 2 MMR units, - 1 dual Glide Slope (G/S) antenna, - 1 dual Localizer (LOC) antenna, - 2 GPS antennas. MANUAL TUNING ILS FUNCTION From each MCDU both MMR units can be manually tuned through their onside FMGC. AUTO TUNING In normal operation, the GPS 1 data are used by the Air Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) 1 and 3; the GPS 2 data by the ADIRU 2. In order to reduce GPS initialization time, the GPS 1 (2) receives data from the ADIRU 1(2). The Inertial Reference (IR) portion of the ADIRU 1(2) gives to the FMGC 1(2): - pure IR data, - pure GPS data (in this case the ADIRU operates as a relay), - hybrid GPIR data. The FMGC 1(2) uses the hybrid GPIR 1(2) data for position fixing functions. The pure GPS data are used for display on the MCDU 1 and 2. In case of one GPS failure, the three ADIRUs automatically select the only operative GPS to compute hybrid GPIR data. In case of one ADIRU 1 failure, the FMGC 1 uses ADIRU 3/GPS 1 data. In case of one ADIRU 2 failure, the FMGC 2 uses ADIRU 3/GPS 2 data. The primary source of ADIRU 3 being the GPS 1, it is necessary to select the secondary input port of the ADIRU 3 Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) NOTE: To return to the auto-tuning mode, the manual mode has to be cleared. BACK-UP TUNING In case of failure of both FMGCs, a back-up tuning is provided by RMP 1 and 2. Either RMP controls both MMR units, if NAV mode is activated by selecting NAV key on RMP 1 and 2. In this mode, the RMP 1 can control the MMR 2 through the RMP 2, which can control the MMR 1 through the RMP 1. NOTE: RMP 3 is not used for navaids tuning. In emergency electrical configuration only RMP 1 is supplied. ANTENNAS The dual G/S and dual LOC antennas are common to both MMR units. Each antenna has two independent connectors, for each MMR units. GPS FUNCTION CATTS LTD GPS OPERATION The GPS function is achieved by two stand-alone satellite navigation sensors using the US GPS satellites constellation. The GPS primary Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 83 of 209 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY function is to track the Radio Frequency (RF) signals received from the satellites, to compute its own position and to provide the GPS data to the FMGCs through the three ADIRUs. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) or Autonomous Integrity Monitoring Extrapolation (AIME) provides integrity and availability of this data. The GPS function provides three-dimensional aircraft position, velocities and exact time used for hybrid computations by the three ADIRUs. In case of failure of one GPS function, the ADIRU automatically selects the only operative GPS function to compute hybrid GP-IRS data. NOTE: As long as GPS/IRS mode is active, radio updating DME/DME or VOR/DME is not allowed. LGCIU Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a ground/flight discrete signal, which is used by the receiver BITE module to count the MMR internal flight legs. ANTENNAS The GPS antenna is an L-band active antenna, with an integrated preamplifier and filter, providing an omni-directional upper hemispheric coverage. The GPS antenna operates at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz called L1. A second frequency of 1227.6 MHz, called L2, is used to estimate the propagation error of L1 and to suppress it. ADIRU To reduce initialization time, MMR unit 1 and 2 receive position data (latitude, longitude), time and date from the associated ADIRU. In case of failure of ADIRU 2 the primary source of ADIRU 3 being GPS 1, it is necessary to select the second input port of ADIRU 3 (GPS 2) by means of the ATTitude/HeaDinG selector knob on the SWITCHING panel to preserve the side 1/side 2 segregation: - MMR 1 provides data to FMGC 1 through ADIRU 1, - MMR 2 provides data to FMGC 2 through ADIRU 3. FMGC The Inertial Reference (IR) portion of ADIRU 1 or 2 provides FMGC 1 or 2 with pure IR data, pure GPS data and hybrid GP-IRS data for position fixing.

WXR PRINCIPLE The WXR helps the pilots to avoid these areas and the related turbulences by determining their range and bearing. It can also be used for ground mapping. The radar emits microwave pulses through a directive antenna, which receives the return signals that are the echoes. The distance is determined by the time necessary for the echoes to come back. The azimuth is given by the antenna position when the echo is received.

The system will continuously scan the atmosphere in front of the aircraft from 0 to 60,000 ft. In automatic mode, RDR-4000 sends data about all detected weather cells to the ND. The cells that are not in the vertical flight path of the aircraft (called OFF PATH weather cells) are shown on the ND with hatched colors. The cells that are in the vertical flight path of the aircraft (called ON PATH cells) are shown in solid colors. The pilots can also select an altitude layer that will be extracted and displayed on the ND. This is the constant elevation mode that is used for weather cell analysis. When the system starts, a delay of 30 seconds is necessary before the 3D buffer is filled. There is a new display OFF mode which removes weather echo from the ND while the system scans the atmosphere and updates its 3D buffer. The weather radar image is shown independently on the CAPT and F/O NDs. The ND also shows mode messages related to the mode CAPT and F/O selection on the control panel (the CAPT mode selection is shown on the CAPT ND, the F/O selection is shown on the F/O ND). The colors used to show the disturbance intensity are: - black, green, yellow and red to show different precipitation rates, - magenta to show the turbulence areas (maximum 40 NM).

The antenna scans a 180\u00b0 sector in azimuth and has a tilt coverage of + or - 15\u00b0. An internal circuit of the transceiver fulfils the antenna stabilization. The stabilization data is: Pitch and roll angles, selected tilt, antenna azimuth and elevation angle. GENERAL (SINGLE INSTALLATION) The Weather Radar (WXR) and Predictive WindShear (PWS) System is composed of: - 1 control panel, - 1 WXR transceiver (XCVR), - 1 antenna assembly, - 1 wave-guide. SYSTEM INTERFACES NOTE: The PWS installation is optional. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION CONTROL UNIT The control unit gives the modes of operation, antenna tilt and gain of the receiver digitized information, via an ARINC 429 bus. An ON/OFF discrete fulfils the energization of the transceiver, which in turn supplies the control unit and the antenna assembly. WXR XCVR The WXR XCVR uses the principle of radio echoing to detect the level of precipitation, the ground map, and the principle of Doppler effect to detect the turbulence areas. The transceiver operates in X-Band frequency at 9345 MHz. It digitizes the video signals on two ARINC 453 data buses connected to the Display Management Computers (DMCs) for display on the NDs. The PWS function also uses the principle of Doppler effect to detect windshear events. Horizontal and vertical wind velocity and aircraft true airspeed are the different windshear components for the determination of the windshear threshold. ADIRU The WXR receives, from Air Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) 1or 3, pitch and roll data, for the stabilization and control of the antenna, and ground speed for Doppler mode correction. The ADIRU, which provides data, is selected by means of the ATTittude/HeaDinG selector switch. The PWS function receives data from ADIRU 1or 3 for velocity calculations: - true airspeed, - altitude (or corrected altitude), - east/west and north/south velocity ground speeds, - track angle, - true heading, - and magnetic heading. LGCIU The Landing Gear Control Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends ground/flight and landing gear extended information to the transceiver. This discrete signal is used by the receiver BITE module to count the flight legs. The landing gear extended signal is used to determine if the A/C is taking-off or landing to generate the aural warning message: - GO AROUND, WINDSHEAR AHEAD in approach, - Or WINDSHEAR AHEAD, WINDSHEAR AHEAD at take-off. ANTENNA ASSEMBLY CFDIU The WXR antenna is energized and controlled in azimuth and elevation by the WXR XCVR. The radio frequency signals are exchanged The MCDUs let the system be tested via the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). The test is only available on ground.

QUALIFIERS A AND B SIGNALS (IF PWS INSTALLED) Two types of qualifier inputs are required to enable automatic activation of the windshear function. - Qualifier type A: 2 qualifiers are used (QA1 and QA2). Provided by the Air Traffic Control (ATC)/Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) control unit, which indicates the position of the AUTO/ON/STBY switch. Qualifier A is valid when AUTO or ON is selected. - Qualifier type B: 2 qualifiers are used (QB1 and QB2). Provided by the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) 1 and 2, which indicate a normal engine oil pressure. Qualifier B is valid when the engine is running (high oil pressure). The windshear function is automatically activated below 2300 ft RA and one of each qualifier A and one of each qualifier B have to be valid. RA (IF PWS INSTALLED) The RA gives the altitude information through an ARINC 429 bus. This data is used for automatic activation, together with the two (A & B) qualifiers, of the windshear function. AUDIO INHIBIT SIGNALS (IF PWS INSTALLED) These discretes are used to indicate whether the aural alert output has to be active or not. - PWS aural alerts (discrete input) are inhibited by the reactive windshear and stall warning from the Flight Warning Computers (FWCs), - PWS discrete output is used to inhibit aural alerts generated by TCAS or Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) or other FWC warnings. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) AUDIO MIXING BOX (IF PWS INSTALLED) An analog audio output transmits the aural alert windshear to an audio mixing box connected to loudspeakers. EGPWS The EGPWS receives PWS alerts from the radar hazard bus to determine the priorities. Alert priorities are: - WXR/PWS warning, - WXR/PWS caution, - Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) terrain warning, - GPWS terrain caution. INDICATING The WXR XCVR is connected to the DMCs by means of two ARINC 453 buses. Each data bus wiring is terminated at one end by a low inductance resistor (68 ohms) to avoid a signal return. The WXR image is shown on the CAPT and F/O NDs when ROSE or ARC mode is selected on the EFIS control panel. The windshear events are shown on the CAPT and F/O NDs and all visual alerts on the CAPT and F/O PFDs for caution or warning alert (Advisory is only shown on NDs). NOTE: When both EFIS control panels are in PLAN mode, the WXR/PWS transceiver is de-energized.

TRANSCEIVER The RA transceiver measures the radio height of the aircraft in relation to the ground. The transceiver operates in a frequency range of 4.200 to 4.400 MHz. EIU ANTENNA The RA system includes two identical transmission and reception antennas. The operating range of the antenna according to the aircraft attitude is limited to + or - 30\u00b0 for pitch and roll. FAN LGCIU Each RA transceiver is cooled by an associated fan, attached under the transceiver mount. A capacitor is mounted on the fan case in order to suppress the parasites.

The Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) is an optional system, which ensures the same functions as the TCAS. When the intruder represents a collision threat, the TCAS (or T2CAS) triggers an aural and visual alarm known as Resolution Advisory (RA), which informs the crew about avoidance maneuvers. NOTE: The TCAS II provides indications to avoid these intruders by changing the flight path in the vertical plane only. The TCAS detects the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system or TCAS equipped aircraft and maintains surveillance within a range determined by its sensivity. To evaluate threat potential of other aircraft the system divides the space around aircraft into 4 volumes. OTHER TRAFFIC VOLUME The other traffic volume is the first volume providing the presence and the progress of an intruder. The aircraft detected in this zone does not represent a collision threat. PROXIMATE TRAFFIC VOLUME The proximate traffic volume is defined by a given volume around the TCAS (or T2CAS) equipped aircraft. The aircraft detected in this zone does not represent a collision threat, but is declared in vicinity. TA VOLUME When the intruder is relatively near but does not represent an immediate threat, the TCAS (or T2CAS) provides aural and visual information known as Traffic Advisory (TA). The TCAS (or T2CAS) aural messages can be inhibited depending on higher priority aural messages.

The TCAS computer ensures two main functions: - a transmission/reception function for intruder acquisition, - a processing function for operation control: Digital, discrete and analog types interfaces, intruder trajectory computation and tracking, visual and aural alert commands. NOTE: As an option, the Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) part of the Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the TCAS. ANTENNA The TCAS (or TCAS part of theT2CAS if installed) directional antennas provide azimuth information on aircraft located within the TCAS (or T2CAS-TCAS) surveillance range. They transmit at 1.030 MHz and receive at 1.090 MHz. The phase and amplitude of the received signal depend on the direction of the signal source, which permits the relative bearing of the transmitting aircraft to be determined. SUPPRESSOR The TCAS (or T2CAS-TCAS if installed), ATC, and the Distance Measurement Equipment (DME) operate in the same frequency range. A suppressor signal is transmitted, via a coaxial, by the operating system to inhibit the other systems and to prevent simultaneous transmission. CONTROL PANEL The operating modes of the TCAS (or T2CAS-TCAS if installed) are selected on a common ATC/TCAS control panel. The TCAS (or T2CAS-TCAS if installed) information is transmitted to the TCAS (or T2CAS) computer via the ATC transponder.

The Mode S transponder permits communication between the TCAS and a TCAS equipped and detected aircraft through the communication link function for exchanging coordination messages. RADIO ALTIMETER The RA transceivers provide radio height used as reference to determine the computation sensitivity level and trigger the inhibit orders. The radio height is used in the 0 to 2.500 ft range. ADIRU The Inertial Reference (IR) part of the Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) provides the magnetic heading and the pitch and roll attitude information to the TCAS (or T2CAS) computer. NOTE: The barometric altitude is transmitted via the ATC transponder.

The tests are only available on ground. LGCIU The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) provides a flight/ground signal used by the BITE module for flight leg counting. It provides also a landing gear extended signal for TCAS (or T2CAS) operation. - all traffic/threat traffic display, - ground display mode (TA mode), - number of intruders displayed (8 maximum), - aircraft altitude limit (48.000 ft). DATA LOADER It will be possible to load software data into the TCAS (or T2CAS) computer by means of a data loader. The remote loading capability is linked by 2 ARINC 429 low speed buses to a dedicated connector in the aircraft. INDICATING Visual indications are presented on the NDs and PFDs. The NDs present the location of intruders in the traffic area. The PFDs present the avoidance maneuver indications on the vertical speed scale. The Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) monitor the validity of the information. Synthesized voice announcements generated by the TCAS (or T2CAS) computer and broadcast by the loudspeakers accompany the visual indications. INHIBITION Various discrete signals are used for inhibition by equipment with higher priority than the TCAS (or T2CAS). These priorities are: - Stall, - WindShear, - Predictive WindShear (PWS), - Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) messages.

EGPWS = GPWS + \"ENHANCED\" functions. As an option, the Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can be installed instead of the EGPWS. The T2CAS includes partitioned modular functions for both Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) functions. The TAWS part of T2CAS carries out the same functions as the EGPWS. - basic GPWS functions (Modes 1 to 5), mainly based on Radio Altitude, - predictive modes: Collision Prediction and Alerting (CPA) function and Terrain Hazard Display (THD) function, which gives forward-looking terrain avoidance and premature descent alert functions. PRINCIPLE The purpose of the EGPWS is to help prevent accidents caused by Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). When the limits of an alerting envelope are exceeded, aural alert messages, visual annunciations and displays are generated. The basic GPWS modes generate aural and visual warnings that correspond to an aircraft behavior when the alert envelope is penetrated. The \"ENHANCED\" functions added to the basic GPWS modes are: - Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF): Increases the terrain clearance envelope around the airport runway. NOTE: With the optional geometric altitude function, the EGPWS can operate reliably in extreme local pressure or temperature variations from standard. - Terrain Awareness alerting and Display (TAD): Includes a terrain database to predict conflict between flight path and terrain and to display the conflicting terrain. NOTE: The EGPWS can also include an obstacle database in which are recorded the man-made obstacles. They are treated as terrain. The alerting functions integrated in the T2CAS-TAWS part are: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 131 of 209 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL & PRINCIPLE Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 132 of 209 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY EGPWS PRESENTATION (2) COMPONENTS The system comprises an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Computer (EGPWC) (or T2CAS), a GPWS control panel, two warning lights and two TERRain ON ND mode P/BSWs. The EGPWS (T2CAS-TAWS) is connected to various navigation systems: - weather radar (WXR), - RA, - Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS), - ILS, - and so on... It processes the navigation data and generates alarms. The T2CAS is made of a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). Controls of the T2CAS are similar to the EGPWS ones.

The \"ENHANCED\" GPWS functions allow the terrain hazards to be displayed on the NDs. Optionally, the NDs can also display the obstacle hazards as well as highest and lowest elevations known as peaks mode. The EGPWS and the T2CAS have very similar principles (same layer colorations). Both systems provide an anticipated background display in descent (approximately 30 sec). NOTE: The T2CAS has one specific feature, which is the AVOID TERRAIN display. This unique warning is provided to immediately notify the crew that the normal recovery will not work.

As an option, the Terrain Awareness and Warning system (TAWS) part of the Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the EGPWS. The T2CAS computer is a single Line replaceable Unit (LRU) for both Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and TAWS functions. All cockpit hardware interfaces (lights, P/BSWs) for the T2CAS-TAWS remain identical to the EGPWS. The interfaces are also identical for the TAWS peripheral systems. DIGITAL INPUTS The EGPWS receives ARINC 429 data inputs from the navigation sensors in order to monitor the aircraft position with respect to the terrain and provide audio and visual warnings when in hazardous situation. DIGITAL OUTPUTS An ARINC 429 transmitter provides a maintenance output data bus. This output bus is used by the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) for maintenance purposes and by the Aircraft Integrated Data System (AIDS) for the Data Management Unit (DMU), part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU). ENHANCED FUNCTIONS The EGPWC outputs a display of terrain data in ARINC 453 data bus format to the Display Management Computers (DMCs). The terrain data is displayed on the NDs automatically instead of the radar image when a terrain caution or warning is detected or any time by using the TERR Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) ON ND P/BSWs. The EGPWS receives the Predictive WindShear (PWS) alerts from the weather radar hazard bus to determine the priority. The PWS has priority over EGPWS modes. The EGPWC uses preferably GPS position, then IRS latitude and longitude data as valid position source and, if these positions are downgraded, then FMS position will be used. Two architectures are available to receive GPS data. The first one uses the ADIRS connection as GPS data are transmitted via the IR1 bus, and the second one will use a direct connection between EGPWC and MMR1 if ADIRU1 is not able to transmit GPS data. EGPWS CONTROLS Various P/BSWs let the crew control the actions of the EGPWS. When pressed in, on the GPWS control panel: - the TERR P/BSW with the white OFF legend, inhibits the Terrain Awareness Display (TAD) and the Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) modes, - the SYStem P/BSW with the white OFF legend, inhibits all the GPWS warnings (mode 1 to 5), - the Glide/Slope MODE P/BSW with the white OFF legend, inhibits the G/S mode (mode 5), - the FLAP MODE P/BSW with the white OFF legend, inhibits flap abnormal condition input (mode 4) and generates the green \"GPWS FLAP MODE OFF\" memo on the left memo area of the EWD, - the LanDinG FLAP 3 P/BSW with the white ON legend selects the landing FLAP 3 position and generates the green \"GPWS FLAP 3\" memo on the right memo area of the EWD. When pressed in, the PULL UP GPWS P/BSW on the instrument panels has two functions: - it sends a ground signal to trigger the self test sequence, - it cancels the G/S aural and visual warnings when triggered. When the TERR ON ND P/BSW is pressed in, on the center instrument panel, the green ON legend comes on to indicate that terrain data is shown on the ND. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 137 of 209 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY AURAL WARNINGS LGCIU The audio output is used to broadcast aural warning messages, which identify the activated mode. When the EMERgency CANCel key on the ECAM Control Panel (ECP) is pressed, an audio suppression signal is sent to the EGPWC in order to momentarily cancel the EGPWS warnings. The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a flight/ground discrete signal to the EGPWC BITE to count the flight legs. This discrete is also used for Mode 4: Unsafe terrain clearance. VISUAL WARNINGS In hazardous flight configurations or system failures, the EGPWC sends discretes for the lighting of warning legends. Five discretes control the warning legends: - one for red PULL UP legends, comes on red when the second boundary of Mode 1 is penetrated or when Mode 2, or any TAD or TCF alert is activated, - one for amber GPWS legends, comes on amber when any other mode is activated. - two monitor outputs for the amber FAULT legends on the SYS and TERR P/BSWs of the GPWS control panel. These discretes are also sent to the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) to generate the ECAM \"GPWS FAULT\" and \"GPWS TERR DET FAULT\" warning messages, - one monitor output for the availability of the terrain mode. In case of Flight Management System (FMS) low accuracy a green TERR STBY is sent through the SDACs to the right memo area of the EWD. FWC The Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) send a discrete to the EGPWC to inhibit all warnings when a stall or windshear warning is triggered. The EGPWC sends two discretes to the FWCs and the Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) in order to inhibit auto call out and low speed warnings and change TCAS mode from Resolution Advisory (RA) to Traffic Advisory (TA) when the PULL UP or GPWS warnings are in progress. These discretes are also used by the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR).

NOTE: The basic GPWS modes 1 and 2 are automatically inhibited when CPA and THD functions are operating. Optionally, an automatic deactivation of predictive function upon navigation high/low accuracy criteria can be activated, if the TAWS logic uses the Flight Management System (FMS) 1 lateral position. When this option is activated, the predictive mode is deactivated if the navigation accuracy is low. The green \"TERR STBY\" ECAM memo is displayed and mode 1 and 2 are reactivated. The Ground Collision Avoidance Module (GCAM) ensures a very low rate of nuisance alerts to keep the crew confident in the generated alerts. It addresses some specific situations such as situations of normal aircraft operation according to procedures at altitudes significantly below the surrounding local terrain height (approaches in steep valleys). If GCAM predicts that the A/C can not climb over the terrain with sufficient safety margin: - the aural \"AVOID TERRAIN\" warning is triggered, - visual black crosses are displayed in the solid red on the ND. NOTE: The T2CAS is not compatible with the weather radar autotilt function for ground clutter suppression.

[ Mode 1 has two boundaries. Penetration of the first boundary generates a repeated \"SINK RATE\" aural alert and causes both GPWS lights to come on. Penetration of the second boundary generates a repetitive \"PULL UP\" aural alert and causes both PULL UP lights to come on.

It has two areas of application known as mode 2A and 2B. - 2A: Flaps not in landing configuration, and aircraft not on the glide slope beam. Penetration of the boundary causes the GPWS lights to come on, and generates the repeated aural alert: \"TERRAIN\". After \"TERRAIN\" has sounded twice, the warning switches to \"PULL UP\", repeated continually until the aircraft leaves the warning envelope. In addition, the PULL UP lights come on. After the aircraft leaves the boundary, the PULL UP lights stay on and the \"TERRAIN\" aural message persists. These alerts stop when the aircraft increases either the barometric or inertial altitude by 300 feet. - 2B: Flaps in landing configuration. Lowering the flaps to the landing position automatically switches GPWS to mode 2B. In this case lower boundary varies between 200 feet and 600 feet depending on altitude rate. In ILS approach (glide slope deviation \\<\u00b1 2 dots) the lower boundary is fixed at 30 feet. When the aircraft enters the envelope, the alert is the same as for mode 2A. When gear and flaps are in the landing configuration, the aural message is \"TERRAIN\" only and is not followed by \"PULL UP\" if the aircraft remains in the envelope. When the enhanced GPWS functions and the optional geometric altitude function are of high integrity, the upper operational limit is reduced.

The EGPWS keeps all modes active but desensitizes nuisance prone modes function of the predictive mode (TAD) integrity and aircraft location (through envelope modulation). The T2CAS inhibits mode 2 when the Collision Prediction and Alerting (CPA) is in normal operation and the CPA altitude crosscheck is correct. The EGPWS sensor includes a vertical margin (terrain floor) function of Vz and Runway proximity. This margin is directly applied on the terrain cells for T2CAS. The EGPWS and T2CAS both use a caution and a warning sensors projected in a terrain database. EGPWS assumed that the A/C could climb 6\u00b0 all the time. The T2CAS takes into account real time aircraft climb capability to give an alert with guaranteed safety margins. If this safety margins is not sufficient, the AVOID TERRAIN alert is triggered to indicate to the pilot that a turn maneuver is recommended in addition to the PULL UP warning. The EGPWS and the T2CAS have very similar display principles (same layer colorations). Both systems have an anticipated background display in descent (approximately 30 sec). The T2CAS has one specific feature, which is the AVOID TERRAIN display.

The DME, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) operate in the same frequency range. A suppressor coaxial between the ATC transponders, the TCAS and DME interrogators is necessary to prevent simultaneous transmission and to interrupt reception of the other systems. AUTO TUNING In normal operation each Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) automatically tunes its ownside DME interrogator through its ownside Radio Management Panel (RMP) via port A. With failure of one FMGC the other FMGC can control the DME interrogators, one directly, the other through its RMP. When the FMGC fails, the DME receives a discrete signal through the RMP to automatically select port B. AMU MANUAL TUNING LGCIU From each MCDU both DMEs can be manually tuned through their ownside FMGC (via port A). Each Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) sends a discrete signal to the associated DME interrogator. This is a ground/flight information used by the receiver BITE module to count the flight legs. BACK-UP TUNING INDICATING In case of dual FMGC failure the RMPs enable back-up tuning. ANTENNA The DME antenna transmits the DME interrogation and receives the reply from the selected ground station. The DME antenna operates within the low band from 962 MHz to 1213 MHz (1041 to 1150 MHz for interrogation and 962 to 1213 MHz for reply). USERS The DME audio signals are transmitted to the Audio Management Unit (AMU) and then dispatched to the headsets and/or loudspeakers. The pilot can adjust the volume of the DME ground station by pressing the VOR P/B on the Audio Control Panel (ACP) or the LS P/B in case of collocated ILS/DME (if LS mode is selected on EFIS control panel). DME data is sent to the NDs and the PFDs through the Display Management Computers (DMCs) and directly to the optional Digital Distance and Radio Magnetic Indicator (DDRMI). CFDIU The MCDUs allow the systems to be tested and trouble shooting to be performed via the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU). The tests are only available on ground. The DME data is sent to the FMGCs for radio distance computation.

The transponder is interrogated by radar pulses received from the ground station. It automatically replies by a series of pulses. These reply pulses are coded to supply: - aircraft identification (Mode A), - automatic altitude reporting (Mode C) and, - selective calling and transmission of flight data of the aircraft on the ground controller's radar scope. These replies enable the controller to distinguish the aircraft and to maintain effective ground surveillance of the air traffic. The ATC transponder (Mode S) also responds to interrogations from aircraft equipped with a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). NOTE: As an option, the Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the TCAS.

NOTE: Two alerting P/BSWs can optionally be installed in the cockpit in case of hijack. When the hijack code is transmitted, the two P/BSWs come ON. Aural and lighted warnings are also activated in cabin to notify the cabin crew that the cockpit crew will be threatened. CONTROL PANEL A single ATC/TCAS control panel enables system selection. It provides the selected transponder with code and function data and, in return, receives status data. The ATC/TCAS control panel converts selected mode and selected code data into digital data and transmits this data in ARINC 429 format to the selected transponder. In order to monitor the ATC transponders and generate alerts by the Flight Warning System (FWS), the ATC/TCAS control panel is connected to the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) by two discretes connections. The Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs) provide a ground/flight discrete signal to the ATC transponder via the ATC/TCAS control panel for BITE purposes. TRANSPONDER In normal operation, one ATC transponder operates and the other is in standby mode. The operating mode (A, C or S) of the transponder is determined by the decoding of the time between the interrogation pulses. The main function of the mode S transponder is surveillance. Each Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) transponder has its own and unique address coded on 24 bits so that every interrogation can be directed to a specific aircraft preventing multiple replies. The mode S is also used in collision avoidance (TCAS). NOTE: The links between the ATC and the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU), the Flight Control Unit (FCU) and the Inertial Reference (IR) part of the Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) are optionally installed for enhanced surveillance/extended squitters. The links between the MMRs are for extended squitters only. ANTENNAE The ATC antennae transmit replies to interrogations from the ATC ground station. Top and bottom antennas provide the antenna diversity features that allow a better radar coverage. The antenna operates in the 960 MHz to 1.220 MHz frequency band with an interrogation frequency of 1.030 MHz and a reply frequency of 1.090 MHz. SUPPRESSOR The ATC, the DME and the TCAS operate in the same frequency range. A suppressor signal is transmitted, via a coaxial, by the operating system to inhibit the other systems and to prevent simultaneous transmission. ADIRU ADIRU 1 and ADIRU 2 provide barometric altitude to associated transponders for mode C. In case of failure of ADIRU 1 or 2, the pilot can switch to ADIRU 3 through the AIR DATA selector switch. FMGC The Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) provide the flight number. This data will be transmitted to an ATC ground station after a mode S interrogation. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 179 of 209 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY CFDIU The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) allows testing and trouble-shooting of the ATC system through the MCDUs. The tests are only available on ground. TCAS The TCAS allows individual communications with each TCAS equipped aircraft through the Mode S transponder. This enables a coordination of avoidance maneuvers by acquisition, at regular intervals, of the relative altitude and the separation range. NOTE: As an option, the Traffic and Terrain Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) can replace the TCAS. CONDITIONS TO TRANSMIT ADS-B PARAMETERS ON AIRBUS A320 FAMILY The Automatic Dependant Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) application is hosted by the transponder. On Airbus A320 family, there are conditions to transmit ADS-B parameters: - an Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) wiring provision (basic), - transponders capable of Elementary Surveillance (ELS)/EHS/ADS-B (compliant DO-260), - a Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) from any vendor or Global Positioning System Sensor Unit (GPSSU) from Honeywell. NOTE: No need of pin programming to activate ADS-B data transmission. Need certification for operational use if required by regulation. For the retrofit aircraft of the A320 family, an Airbus Service Bulletin for ADS-B OUT certification is available: SB 34-1418. But, for the forward fit aircraft of the A320 family, the ADS-B OUT certification is proposed as an option on production aircraft: CN.34.52.117 / 02.

The VOR system receives, decodes and processes bearing information from the omni-directional ground station, working in the frequency range of 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz. The ground VOR station generates a reference phase signal and a variable phase signal. The phase difference between these signals, called bearing, is function of the aircraft position with respect to the ground station. The bearing is the angle between the magnetic north and the ground station/aircraft axis. Furthermore, the VOR station provides a Morse identification, which identifies the station.

Crew Oxygen System: The flight crew oxygen system supplies oxygen to the flight crew. It is used if there is a loss of cabin pressurization or smoke or dangerous gases in the cockpit. The oxygen is supplied by a high-pressure oxygen cylinder to quick-donning masks in the cockpit. Passenger Oxygen System: The passenger and cabin attendant oxygen system is supplied by chemical oxygen generator units that are in the cabin, the cabin attendant stations, the lavatories and the galleys. There are two types of chemical generators that supply oxygen for 15 minutes or 22 minutes. Portable Oxygen System: The portable oxygen system supplies oxygen to the passengers, the cabin attendants and the flight crew if an emergency occurs and for first aid treatment. The Portable Breathing Equipment (PBE) supplies breathing means and eye protection to the flight crew members and the cabin attendants. It lets them move freely to extinguish a fire. The high-pressure portable cylinder includes continuous-flow type masks and supplies first aid oxygen to the passengers. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 6 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY SYSTEM OVERVIEW Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 7 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY OXYGEN SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) FLIGHT CREW OXYGEN SYSTEM The flight crew oxygen is supplied from a high-pressure oxygen cylinder at a pressure of 127.5 bar (1.850 psig). This cylinder can be isolated for maintenance by a manual ON/OFF valve. A direct-reading pressure gage gives an indication of the cylinder pressure, independently of the open or closed position of the manual valve. The cylinder is installed in a cradle with two quick-release clamps in the L/H avionics compartment. A pressure regulator transmitter assembly is directly connected to the cylinder. It includes a high-pressure stage with an integrated pressure transducer for ECAM indication and a low-pressure stage. The pressure regulator regulates the low pressure at 4.48 to 6.48 bar (65 to 94 psig). A supply valve opens or closes the crew oxygen supply. The CREW SUPPLY P/B on the oxygen panel controls the supply valve. High-pressure and low-pressure protection is done by safety devices that include a high-pressure safety outlet and a low-pressure safety outlet. The high-pressure safety outlet is a frangible disk type. The low-pressure safety outlet is a pressure relief valve. Rupture of the frangible disk is set at a cylinder pressure of 2500 to 2775 psig. The pressure relief valve sets the limit of the low-pressure oxygen supply to 175 psig. An overboard green discharge indicator is connected to the high-pressure safety outlet and to the low-pressure safety outlet. If there is overpressure, the green disk blows out and a yellow indicator comes into view to show that the cylinder was discharged or the pressure relief valve is open. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD A pressure switch and a test port are connected to the distribution manifold. The pressure switch operates when the oxygen supply pressure decreases to 3.45 plus or minus 0.35 bar (50 plus or minus 5 psig) and transmits a warning signal REGUL LO PR to the ECAM/DOOR/OXY page. The optional filling connector makes it possible to fill the oxygen cylinder without removal of the cylinder from the aircraft. On the lower ECAM DU, on the DOOR/OXY page, the oxygen pressure in a cylinder with a capacity of 77 cubic feet is shown as follows: (a) \\< 400 psig, in amber. (b) 400 psig, in green. The indication flashes in green when the pressure is less than 800 psig and the DOOR/OXY page comes into view automatically. (c) An amber half-frame comes into view when the oxygen pressure is less than 1500 psig. For a cylinder with a capacity of 115 cubic feet: (d) \\< 300 psig, in amber. (e) 300 psig, in green. The indication flashes in green when the pressure is less than 600 psig and the DOOR/OXY page comes into view automatically. (f) An amber half-frame comes into view when the oxygen pressure is less than 1000 psig. If the oxygen pressure decreases to less than the minimum operating pressure of 3.45 plus or minus 0.35 bar (50 plus or minus 5 psig), the indication REGUL LO PR is shown in amber on the DOOR/OXY page. The mask assembly and the stowage box are installed adjacent to each crew member seat. The stowage box contains the mask. When the mask is pulled out of the box, a supply valve installed in the stowage box opens and lets oxygen flow to the mask. Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 8 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY To use the mask, squeeze the red clips. This will inflate the mask harness. Bring the mask in position and release the red clips. When the red clips are released, the oxygen flow to the harness stops and the oxygen that remains in the harness is released into the atmosphere. The mask is then ready to be used.

A taped message is transmitted on the passenger address system. The passenger SYStem ON indicator light comes on white when the passenger oxygen system is electrically supplied. A reset is available to rearm the electrical system after mask re-stowage. The door can be opened manually with a release tool if there is a failure of the container door opening system. When the TiMeR RESET pushbutton is pushed, the ON white light of the TMR RESET pushbutton comes on. The indicator light SYS ON goes off and the taped announcement stops. On the ground, used chemical oxygen units must be replaced and all masks must be re-stowed. The system is reset when the TMR RESET pushbutton is pushed momentarily on the maintenance panel. Manually operated door stops are installed on the container doors. These stops are used to do an operational test of the mask release system. In the test position, because of the stops, the doors will not open fully and the masks will not fall out of the container.

When the needle is in the FULL range of the gage, the pressure is correct. If the pressure is incorrect, it is necessary to replace the portable oxygen bottle. The PBE is vacuum-packed in a transport/storage container. The container includes two indications, which are used for preflight inspection: - A good condition indicator (related to the PBE type, e.g. green operational, red - not operational), - A tamper seal (in position - operational, broken - not operational).

The gaseous oxygen is colorless, odorless and tasteless. The gaseous oxygen is not flammable, but supports combustion. The gaseous oxygen is heavier than air and can accumulate in low lying areas. The oxygen reacts to most metals and organic material. The reactivity varies with the type of material: - The reaction can be slow and can cause for example steel oxidation commonly called rust, - The reaction can be fast when the oxygen is in contact with petroleum product, and can cause fire or explosion.

In case of aircraft depressurization the oxygen systems (ATA35) supply sufficient oxygen partial pressure to the crew and passengers until the aircraft gets at lower altitude (10000ft). A lot of those systems use bottle of highly pressurized oxygen.

In comparison to a fire in the air, a fire in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere will be characterized by: - High in intensity, - Higher in temperature and, - Higher in thermal power. Pure oxygen at high pressure will react violently with materials such as oil, grease, textiles and rubber, and will get powerfully in fire. In most cases, a fire that occurs in an atmosphere full of oxygen cannot be extinguished as long as the cause of fire has not been isolated. FIRST AID Persons getting on fire in an atmosphere full of oxygen cannot get help directly by a person entering the area. The rescuer takes also the risk to get on fire. The victim must be sprayed of water and carried outside in free air as soon as possible. The first aid care must be applied immediately and if possible in a specialized care unit for badly burned person.

Such a high pressure is potentially dangerous. Any crack in the pressure wall of pressurized gas system causes a violent eruption of gas through the crack. The result can be a high or even violent explosion. For example, if a valve brakes off a high-pressure cylinder, the container becomes an unguided missile. That is the reason why the oxygen cylinders and pressure reducers must be tested at regular intervals (hydrostatic test every 3 - 5 years depending on applicable standard / special permit).

On the ground, when the aircraft is parked not powered (dead aircraft), these ventilations are not effective any more. The oxygen bottle and the distribution lines are installed in confined area. In the case of oxygen leak, the percentage of oxygen in the air will be higher.

Carefully obey the maintenance procedure instructions. If you do not obey these instructions, you can cause a fire or an explosion. Prevent all maintenance procedures nearer than 5m (16.4ft) from the working area of the aircraft. Stop all refueling, and all repairs on fuel and hydraulic systems. Stop all procedures that use flammable material such as cleaning and de-icing material. Stop all operations that cause heat and flame (For example: drilling holes...). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 38 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 39 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY OXYGEN SAFETY IN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE ENVIRONMENT (2) SAFETY PRECAUTIONS (continued) DURING OXYGEN SERVICING Put a warning notice in the cockpit, the work area and the cabin to tell persons not to operate electrical switches during the oxygen filling procedure. Electrostatically ground the aircraft and also electrostatically bond the oxygen charging equipment to the aircraft. If a thunderstorm can occur, immediately stop all oxygen filling operations. Stop the filling procedure immediately if the pressures in each oxygen cylinder do not increase smoothly and at the same time. Only use aviator's breathing oxygen as defined by Airbus. Keep all hydrocarbons (fuels, corrosion protection compounds, lubricants, etc.) away from all sources of oxygen. Oxygen becomes explosive when it touches hydrocarbons. Open the hand-valves of the oxygen cylinder very slowly and turn them to the fully open position. In the case the hand-valves are not fully open before flight, the data of the oxygen pressure on the corresponding ECAM page will not be correct.

Equipment that is not approved can cause contamination of the system and injury. Always work with clean clothes and tools. Keep your hands clean (possibly, wear gloves in cotton). Do not touch connection ends and interior of oxygen components with bare hands, because skin oil and bacteria are a source of contamination. The area around the oxygen components must always be cleaned with approved cleaner before and after any work done on the system. Any tool, rag, cloth, or equipment that is not clean and free of oil traces must not be used or stay in the area around the oxygen components. Make sure that all oxygen cylinder valves are closed. Due to possible residual pressure in the line, disconnect the connectors carefully. Put dry, clean, metal or plastic plugs on all pipes or units removed temporarily. Put each pipe or unit in a sealed vinyl bag. Unwanted material in the oxygen system could damage the system or cause explosion if oil ingress. Make sure that the flexible hoses are not twisted or pulled tight. If the hoses are twisted or pulled tight the connections will break and cause a leak. Torque the connection at the right value given by the maintenance manual. Open and close the spring-loaded clamps carefully to prevent damage to the electrical harness near the oxygen cylinders. WARNING: NEVER USE STANDARD OIL TO LUBRICATE THE CONNECTOR THREAD (risk of explosion). ONLY LUBRICANTS and thread compounds SPECIFICALLY APPROVED FOR OXYGEN must be used. Some unit/assembly are heavy. Support the unit/assembly carefully to prevent injury to persons and damage. During disconnection/reconnection of an oxygen line connector use two wrenches: one for the nut and one for the counter nut to avoid force onto the material (risk of rupture and leakage).

The stowage box which contains the mask, also controls the flow of oxygen when the mask is pulled out of the box. To use the mask, squeeze the red clips, which will inflate the mask harness; releasing the red clips will stop oxygen flow to the harness and vent the oxygen remaining in the harness to the atmosphere. Oxygen flow is indicated by the blinker showing yellow and an OXY ON flag, which appears on the left door when closed. The mask regulator provides either normal or pure oxygen by means of a Normal/100% selector. In the Normal position, the user breathes a mixture of cabin air and oxygen. When the selector is in the 100% position, the user will breathe pure oxygen. When the emergency rotation knob is rotated, the mask regulator supplies 100% of oxygen at a permanent positive pressure, independent of the position of the normal/100% selector. To take the mask off, the harness has to be inflated. This is done by operating the red clips.

They are hung on lanyards within the reach of users. When the first user pulls the mask towards his face, the release pin starts the chemical generation. Oxygen flows through the flexible supply hoses to all masks of the container. Each flow indicator shows a green stripe. CHEMICAL OXYGEN GENERATION The chemical generator uses the basic principal of thermal decomposition of sodium chlorate. A thermal indicator shows the generator condition. According to the generator type, there can be two different indicators: 1- Black: the oxygen generator has been burned out. - Yellow: the oxygen generator is new. 2- Blue: the oxygen generator has been burned out. - Pink: the oxygen generator is new. The chlorate core is fitted in a stainless steel housing. GENERATOR OPERATION By pulling the release pin of the starter assembly the spring loaded firing pin will hit the percussion cap. The heat produced in the percussion cap will then activate the starting powder of the generator.

The rate of the oxygen flow depends on the altitude. The oxygen supply starts automatically at a cabin pressure equivalent to an altitude exceeding 14.000 ft (4.265 m) and stops when the cabin pressure drops below a pressure equivalent to 10.000 ft (3.050 m). The system can than be re-started if the aircraft has to climb to clear another obstacle. The gaseous oxygen system has no characteristic flight profile. Since the flow is greater with the altitude, the lower the flight is done the longer the oxygen supply lasts. High-pressure oxygen is stored in oxygen cylinder assemblies installed behind sidewall linings RH in the bulk cargo compartment. The standard system has 6 oxygen cylinders. Up to 8 oxygen cylinders can be installed on airline request. When the system is operated, low-pressure oxygen from the pressure regulators is supplied to the two Main Distribution Lines (MDLs). One line is installed below the cabin floor along the LH side of the aircraft. The other line is installed above the cabin ceiling. Riser Lines (RLs) are connected to the MDLs to supply oxygen to the hat rack lines. The hat rack lines supply oxygen to the oxygen containers. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 61 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 62 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY PASSENGER GASEOUS OXYGEN SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) THERMAL COMPENSATORS PASSENGER OXYGEN SYSTEM STORAGE OXYGEN CYLINDER ASSEMBLY The high-pressure oxygen cylinder is made of carbon fibres wrapped around an aluminium inner liner. It has the capacity of 3310 liter (116.9 cuft) at a pressure of 127.5 bar (1850 psig). The cylinder head valve assembly is made of: - a slow-opening Shutoff Valve (SOV) with an integrated reed switch sensor for closed/open identification, - a direct-reading pressure gage, - a high-pressure safety outlet with a burst disc, - an inlet/outlet port. To protect the cylinder from overpressure, the oxygen cylinder has a high-pressure safety outlet with a burst disc. The burst disc will rupture at a pressure of 169 bar (2451 psig) at a temperature of 71 \u00b0C (160 \u00b0F) and 191 bar (2770 psig) at a temperature of 21 \u00b0C (70\u00b0F). OVERBOARD DISCHARGE INDICATOR The overboard discharge indicator makes a continuous surface with the outside skin of the aircraft. It has a fluorescent green burst disk and a yellow housing. The burst disk of each oxygen cylinder and the safety outlet of the pressure relief valve are connected via the overboard discharge line with the overboard discharge indicator. In case of overpressure in the higher part or in the intermediate pressure part, the green burst disk is blown out and a reflective yellow area of the discharge indicator is shown. OXYGEN PRESSURE REDUCER The oxygen pressure reducer transmitter assembly is directly connected to the inlet/outlet port of the oxygen cylinder assembly and reduces the cylinder pressure to the intermediate pressure of 7.6 \u00b1 0.7 bar (110 \u00b1 10 psig). The outlet of the oxygen pressure reducer is connected with the intermediate pressure line. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD The thermal compensators prevent dangerous increases of temperature during replenishment of oxygen cylinder. They are installed in the high-pressure line (fill line) immediately in front of the pressure reducers. TEMPERATURE TRANSDUCER The temperature transducer measures the ambient temperature in the installation area of oxygen cylinders and generates a related electrical signal sent to the Quantity Calculation and Control Unit (QCCU) for the computation. PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE A pressure relief valve is installed between the intermediate pressure line and the overboard discharge line. It is a double redundant safety valve. The inlet port of the pressure relief valve is connected with the intermediate pressure line. If the pressure in the intermediate pressure line exceeds 9.7 \u00b1 0.7 bar (140 \u00b1 10 psig), the valves will open. The overpressure can then discharge via the overboard discharge line. The relief valve closes when the pressure decreases below 8.3 bar (120 psig). For redundancy functions, two valves are arranged in series to prevent system pressure loss if one valve fails to close. Two serial valve devices are arranged in parallel. OXYGEN FILLING PORT The oxygen filling port enables the connection of an oxygen ground filling equipment for cylinders replenishing. The oxygen filling port has: - a flow restrictor to make sure safe pressure rises, - a filter to prevent contamination of the system, - an external cap with a safety chain.

The low-pressure oxygen is supplied to the two MDLs. At the FR47/51, the MDL is split in two: One line is installed below the cabin floor along the LH side of the aircraft and the other line is installed above the cabin ceiling. The two MDL are joined again at FR 26. The area where the MDLs are doubled is the engine burst area. Riser lines are connected to the MDL's at approximately every 4 fuselage frames to supply oxygen to the hatrack supply lines and to the oxygen containers. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 65 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY PASSENGER OXYGEN SYSTEM DISTRIBUTION - GENERAL Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 66 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY PASSENGER GASEOUS OXYGEN SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) PASSENGER OXYGEN SYSTEM DISTRIBUTION (continued) INTERMEDIATE LINE LOW PRESSURE SWITCH The low-pressure switch is installed in the intermediate pressure line between the pressure reducers and the oxygen regulators. If the pressure in the intermediate pressure line is not sufficient, the low-pressure switch generates a warning signal on the Passenger Oxygen Indication Panel (POXIP) in the cockpit overhead panel. The decreasing pressure is 6.9 bar (100 psi) and the increasing pressure is 5.5 \u00b1 0.7 bar (80\u00b110 psi). The cap of the test port installed in the oxygen distribution system downstream of the oxygen regulators has a bleed/vent function. Together with the bleed/vent valve it allows a sufficient equalization of pressure between the oxygen distribution system and the cabin pressure. This prevents the 'SYS ON' indicator light to come on accidentally when the cabin altitude pressure changes. PRESSURE OXYGEN REGULATORS Two redundant Pressure Oxygen Regulators (PORs) are installed in the intermediate pressure line. Each regulator operates the system independently from the other. The POR integrates a motor driven SOV. At first the POR integrated motor driven SOV is fully opened for approximately 6-9 seconds to surge the MDL. After the surging, the POR measures the ambient pressure (determining cabin altitude) and the pressure in the MDL just downstream of the POR through integrated pressure sensors. The POR compares the pressure in the MDL to the required pressure (depending on cabin altitude) using analogue circuits. The motor driven SOV moves to the position necessary to obtain the correct pressure in the MDL thus supplying the correct flow to the oxygen masks. TEST PORTS The system has three test ports. One is installed in the intermediate pressure line and the other two are installed in the low-pressure distribution network. These test ports are used for the connection of test tool for leakage, pressure tests, system function, and pressure release of the distribution network.

After system activation, the valve opens for approximately 15 to 25 seconds to let the air/oxygen mixture contained in the distribution network be released out of the MDLs and the system is purged. The bleed vent valve contains an orifice, which lets a small amount of oxygen escape from the distribution system. The bleed vent valve also contains a filter protecting the oxygen system from contamination. MDL SHUTOFF VALVES The system has two MDLs SOVs, which are pneumatically controlled. One MDL SOV is installed in the ceiling MDL just AFT of the rim release area. The other MDL SOV is installed in the under floor MDL just AFT of the rim release area. During normal system operation both MDL SOVs are open in flow direction. There are also RL SOVs installed in the engine burst area and the rim release area. They are installed immediately after the connection with the main supply line. In normal operation, the riser line SOVs are open. If a riser line is damaged, the riser line SOV closes automatically. RL CHECK VALVES The system has two check valves installed. One check valve is installed in the ceiling MDL just FWD of the engine burst area. The other check valve is installed in the under floor MDL just FWD of the engine burst area. In normal operation, the check valves are open. When a main line is damaged due to uncontained engine rotor failure or rim release, the check valve closes.

This starts the automatic operation of the oxygen system. The Pressure Oxygen Regulators (PORs) open fully to purge the Main Distribution Line (MDL), measure the cabin altitude of the A/C and the pressure in the distribution network. The POR adjusts the pressure in the distribution line to the required oxygen pressure in order to obtain the correct flow. The POR does not require any software. MANUAL MODE If the altitude SW fails, the MASK MANual ON P/B can be pushed at any time to start the operation of the oxygen system. The MASK MAN ON P/B sends a signal to open the PORs. POR operation is the same as in automatic mode.

The SYStem ON light comes on as soon as one POR is open. An emergency announcement is transmitted over the passenger address system. The oxygen masks container doors open pneumatically and the masks fall. Oxygen only flows to the masks, which are pulled down. RESET The OXYGEN TiMeR RESET P/BSW is used to reset the electrical circuit after the system operation. When the OXYGEN TMR RESET P/BSW is pushed and the cabin altitude is less than 10000 ft, the oxygen regulators will close and the SYS ON indication will turn off when the pressure in the distribution system decreases below 4,5 \u00b1 0,5 kPa (0,045 \u00b1 0,005 bar).

The reverse flow check valve on the damaged part of the MDL will also close in order to seal the damaged area. The surge pressure increases and when the door latch actuation pressure (1.5 bar - 3.0 bar) is reached, the doors of the oxygen container assemblies supplied by the undamaged part of the MDL will be released.

These assemblies are different in length and width. Each type of container can have different numbers of masks. For each mask, there is a flow restrictor and a SOV activated automatically by a lanyard. To carry out the interface requirements of the aircraft the following different oxygen container types are required: - type I installed in the overhead stowage PSU channels to supply 2 to 4 persons with oxygen (LH and RH container), - type II installed in sidewalls, ceilings, lavatories and galleys to supply 2 persons with oxygen. An oxygen container assembly is mainly composed of: - a container housing, - a container door (spring loaded for type II, type I not spring loaded), - a door stop/test button device, - an inlet port inclusive filter, - a pneumatic door latch including a lever for manual opening, - a manifold with individual outlets having SOV integrated for each mask connection, - an oxygen mask assembly, - a flow indicator for each oxygen mask, - a distribution tube from inlet port to manifold and to the pneumatic door latch, - a lanyard to activate the flow to each individual mask.

It sends a signal to open the oxygen regulators, which supply low-pressure oxygen to the oxygen distribution system. In case of high altitude airfield operation option, the altitude switch has two settings: - the first setting closes, if the pressure falls to a value equivalent to 14000 +250/ -750 ft. (4267.12 +76,2/ -228,6 m), - the second setting closes, if the pressure falls to a value equivalent to 16000 +250/ -750 ft. (4876.71 +76,2/ -228,6 m). - the electrical circuit is set to the normal condition, - the oxygen regulators close. In this case the ON light comes on and stays on for 5 seconds. It does not go off if the electrical circuit for the oxygen system does not reset to the correct condition. NOTE: If high altitude airfield operation is required, the system can be adapted by using a dual altitude pressure switch and by adapting the activation circuit. Oxygen Control Panel On the oxygen control panel, the MASK MAN ON P/BSW allows the crew to activate the oxygen system as a backup and override the altitude pressure switch. The oxygen regulators stay open even if the MASK MAN ON P/BSW is released. When the OPEN relays do not operate, it is necessary to hold the MASK MAN ON P/BSW for 1 second to open the oxygen regulators. A safety guard is installed over the MASK MAN ON P/BSW to prevent accidental operation of the system. The SYS ON indicator light on the overhead panel comes on when at least one pressure oxygen regulator is open. When the pressure in the system decreases the SYS ON indicator light goes off. TMR RESET P/B The TMR RESET P/BSW is installed on the maintenance panel and is used to reset the controls after the system operation. When the TMR RESET P/BSW is pushed: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 81 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY CONTROL & INDICATION - GENERAL Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 82 of 107 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY PASSENGER GASEOUS OXYGEN SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) In this case the oxygen cylinders are empty which leads to a NO GO if there are passengers on board. CONTROL & INDICATION (continued) PASSENGER OXYGEN INDICATION PANEL The monitoring of the gaseous oxygen system has indications and warnings, which are displayed to the cockpit crew on the Passenger Oxygen Indication Panel (POXIP) and by a white PASSENGER SYS ON light. As additional attention getters, separate lights are placed next to the cylinder pressure display. These lights will be switched on, in case the cylinder pressure decreases below some values. Maintenance messages cannot be recorded automatically, since no maintenance computer will be installed. Failures requiring maintenance activity will have to be noted by the flight crew, some failure messages will be displayed on the Quantity Calculation and Control Unit (QCCU) itself. Indication of Filling Pressure Depending on the actual value of the analogue input from the QCCU, there are 4 different cases: CASE 1: Fill Pressure 1600 PSI Pressure value indication displayed in BLACK / WHITE. In this case the required system performance is available. CASE 2: 1600 PSI > Fill Pressure 200 PSI Pressure value indication displayed in BLACK / WHITE. CHECK light on in AMBER. In this case the crew must refer to the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) to determine the remaining system performance (descent profile) depending on the number of passengers and the flight plan.

The QCCU receives signals from: - the pressure transmitters integrated in each pressure reducer, - the temperature transducer. The QCCU sends a signal of the arithmetic average pressure of the installed oxygen cylinders to the fill panel indicator (non temperature compensated) and a temperature adjusted pressure to the POXIP. The QCCU also sends a signal to the POXIP if: - the QCCU does not operate, - the signal from the temperature transducer is out of range, - the signals from the pressure transducers are out of range. A \"- -\" instead of a pressure value will be displayed on the POXIP and the respective fault indication on the front of QCCU comes on. QCCU Test The QCCU test is done via the TEST P/B located on its front face. Before pushing this TEST P/B, turn the two switches on the QCCU until the correct number of oxygen cylinders installed in the aircraft comes on, on the QCCU display. If there is no QCCU indication, the TEST P/B can be pushed: - the COMPUTER, TEMPERATURE and PRESSURE indicators come on, - the QCCU displays the \"88\" indication. After 3 seconds: - the COMPUTER, TEMPERATURE and PRESSURE indicators go off, - the QCCU displays the number of selected oxygen cylinders. After 12 seconds, the number of selected oxygen cylinders on the QCCU display goes off.

This port is installed on the oxygen fill panel and enables connection of an external oxygen source for replenishing of the oxygen cylinders. The correct filling pressure depends on the outside and the cargo compartment temperatures, and can be determined by the use of the aircraft placards. To check the correct fill pressure, you have to calculate the average pressure in the replenished oxygen cylinders. Make sure that the pressure on the fill panel pressure indicator is the same as the calculated average pressure in the oxygen cylinders. During filling, an increase in temperature in each cylinder is limited by a thermal compensator. The QCCU monitors the fill pressure in the cylinders and the pressure indication is displayed on the POXIP and on the indicator fill panel. TEST PORT The three test ports enable the maintenance crew to increase and decrease the pressure in the oxygen system during a functional check of the system. The first test port, which is installed in the intermediate line before the oxygen regulators, is used for different tests and checks of the oxygen system. The second test port, which is installed in the oxygen distribution system downstream of the oxygen regulators, is used for different tests and checks of the oxygen distribution system. The third test port, which is installed in the oxygen distribution system downstream of the check valves, lets you decrease the pressure of the supply lines downstream of the check valves. Before the depressurization of the system, it is necessary to close the manual SOVs of the oxygen cylinders.

NOTE: According to the supplier, another indicator is available which shows a yellow indicator if the container has not been opened. The protective breathing hood works with a closed breathing circuit. The system is activated by a starter via a lanyard. The expired air will be regenerated, enriched with oxygen, and inhaled again. The oxygen is generated in exothermic chemical reaction between the potassium peroxide (KO2), the humidity, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the expired air; this reaction releases heat. The protective breathing equipment is composed of three main parts: A hood with: - the neck seal at the level of the neck, - the straps attached to the hood maintain the inner mask around the back of the user head, - a relief valve in the hood, which keeps the overpressure in the hood at a comfortable level. An inner mask installed with: - an anti-suffocation valve, operated by a higher breathing resistance. The user can inhale through this valve from the volume between head and hood, - a speech transmitter is located in front of the oronasal mask. A KO2 cartridge has: - an attached breathing bag installed with a volume-controlled relief valve, - a starter activated by a lanyard, - a fold tube (or breathing hose) connected to the oronasal mask, - a belt, which holds the cartridge on the hood.

The ECAM DOOR/OXY page shows the crew oxygen pressure indication. If the pressure is less than 1500 PSI for a 77 cuft bottle, an amber half frame (advisory) is shown for information. For a 115 cuft bottle, the threshold is 1000 PSI. In this case, check the AMM. This is to see if the minimum oxygen pressure available to the flight crew is within the permitted limits. Refer to the minimum flight crew oxygen pressure chart and find the minimum pressure according to the ambient temperature and the number of crew members. If the pressure is less than the minimum flight crew oxygen pressure the oxygen cylinder must be changed.

HP air can be supplied from the two engines, the APU or an external ground source. But APU BLEED air can also be used in flight, in relation to the altitude. The altitude can be different for each aircraft. These altitude limits are given by the manufacturer. The APU bleed supply is connected to the left side of the crossbleed duct. On the ground, a HP ground power unit can be connected to the left side pneumatic system. The right side can be supplied by opening the crossbleed valve. ENGINE BLEED The engine bleed air receives pressure regulation and temperature regulation before it is supplied to the pneumatic system. Air is bled from two engine High Pressure Compressor (HPC) stages: the Intermediate Pressure (IP) stage and the HP stage. The High Pressure Bleed Valve (HPV) supplies air to the system when the engines are at low power. When the IP bleed is sufficient, the HPV closes. The Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) is installed in the duct downstream of the IP and HP bleed valves, and pneumatically regulates the downstream pressure. Each Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC) monitors the system pressure and will stop the engine bleed if the pressure is too high. An Overpressure Valve (OPV) is also installed downstream from the bleed valve as a protection of the system if the pressure is too high. The temperature of the engine bleed air is regulated to a maximum value. The hot bleed air goes through an air-to-air heat exchanger called the precooler. Fan discharge air, modulated by the Fan Air Valve (FAV), is blown across the pre-cooler to keep the temperature within limits. APU BLEED/EXTERNAL AIR The left and right bleed systems are connected by a crossbleed duct. A crossbleed valve is used for their interconnection or isolation. The APU can also be used for bleed air supply. This is usually done on the ground for air conditioning and for engine start.

BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE. GENERAL The engine air bleed pressure is pneumatically regulated by the High Pressure (HP) Valve (VLV) when air is supplied by the HP stage, or by the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) when the air is supplied by the Intermediate Pressure (IP) stage. The pressure regulation system is monitored by two Bleed Monitoring Computers (BMCs). HP VALVE Switching between IP and HP is done pneumatically when the IP stage pressure is not sufficient (engine at low speed). The HP VLV pneumatically regulates the air supply between 8 and 36 psi. The HP VLV is forced to close when the PRV is closed via the PRV/HP VLV sense line. In flight, the BMC for the A318/A319 fitted with CFM56 and PW6000 engines maintains the HP VLV closed. When the solenoid is de-energized, the opening of the HP VLV is not inhibited. The solenoid will be energized by the BMC when: - the engine is above idle, the pressure PS3 is greater than 110 psi for the PW6000 engines, or 80 psi for the CFM-56 engines, - the Wing Anti-Ice (WAI) is OFF, - the altitude is over 15,000 ft, - the pack configuration is normal. IP CHECK VALVE The PRV pneumatically regulates the bleed pressure around 44 psi. A thermal fuse causes the valve to close in case of engine fire at 450\u00b0C (842\u00b0F). The PRV is pneumatically controlled by an external servo-control, the bleed pressure regulated valve control solenoid (CTL SOL), located downstream from the precooler. The control solenoid operates in two modes, pneumatic and electric, causing complete closure of the PRV. The pneumatic mode is used for: - reverse flow protection - the PRV is closed when a delta pressure between the precooler outlet and the PRV inlet is detected. The electrical mode with PRV shut-off function through energization of the control solenoid is used when: - the ENGine BLEED P/B is selected \"OFF\", - the ENGine FIRE P/B is RELEASED OUT, The solenoid is automatically energized by the BMC in the following cases: - over-temperature downstream of the precooler - the heat exchanger outlet temperature sensor senses a temperature above 257\u00b0C (527\u00b0F), - overpressure downstream of the PRV when the pressure-regulated transducer senses a pressure greater than 57 psi, - leak detection in pylon/wing/fuselage ducts and surrounding areas, - APU bleed valve not closed, - corresponding starter valve not closed. OPV The Overpressure Valve (OPV), which is normally open, closes pneumatically. The OPV starts to close at 75 psi. It is fully closed at 85 psi and opens again at around 35 psi. The IP check valve protects the IP stage from reverse flow when the HP VLV is open.

This pressure is indicated on the ECAM. TRANSFERRED PRESSURE A transducer, connected to the related BMC, reads the transferred pressure downstream from the High Pressure Valve (HPV). This pressure is used to monitor the PRV and the HPV. FAV/CONTROL THERMOSTAT The Fan Air Valve (FAV) pneumatically regulates the fan airflow to the precooler for bleed air temperature regulation at 200\u00b0C (392\u00b0F). The FAV is pneumatically controlled by an external servo-control: the FAV control thermostat (CTL THERMST), located downstream from the precooler. PRECOOLER The precooler is an air-to-air heat exchanger. HEAT EXCHANGER OUTLET TEMPERATURE SENSOR The heat exchanger outlet temperature sensor, connected to both BMCs, reads the regulated temperature downstream from the precooler. This temperature is shown on the ECAM and used to monitor the system. NOTE: Note: If the precooler exchanger outlet temperature reaches 240\u00b0C (464\u00b0F), the BMC generates a class 2 maintenance message - \"AIR BLEED\" - on the ECAM STATUS page. An associated maintenance message \"Thermostat (THRMST), FAV or sense line\" can be seen on the PFR, or on the MCDU.

The Bleed Load Valve for the APU GTCP 36-300A (GARRETT) and the Load Control Valve of Honeywell APU 131-9A are electrically controlled by the ECB (solenoid) and pneumatically operated. In the absence of air pressure or electrical power, the valves are spring-loaded closed. The APU Bleed Control Valve for the APIC APU is electrically controlled and fuel operated by a servo valve. The Electronic Control Box (ECB) controls the servo valve and fuel muscle pressure opens or closes the APU bleed valve. In the absence of fuel pressure or electrical power, the valve shuts off the bleed supply to the aircraft pneumatic system. - the secondary motor is used for manual operation. The X-BLEED selector on the overhead panel controls the position of the valve. OPEN position is used for: - left and right pack supply using single engine bleed, - left and right Wing Anti-Ice supply using single engine bleed, - left and right pack supply using ground air supply, - Engine crossbleed start using opposite engine bleed, - Engine 2 start using ground air supply. SHUT position is used to: - confirm automatic closure during bleed leak detection. HP GROUND CONNECTION A ground cart may supply the pneumatic system. The supply duct is located on the left hand side of the cross bleed valve. Only the LH bleed system is supplied. When the X-BLEED selector is in the OPEN position, the ground air supply will be available to supply the LH and RH system together. NOTE: These valves are of the ON/OFF type. X-BLEED SYSTEM A ground cart may also supply the pneumatic system. The ground air supply duct is connected to the left hand side of the crossbleed duct. The crossbleed (X-BLEED) valve is an electrically controlled shut-off valve operated by two electrical DC motors. The X-BLEED valve is used to isolate or connect the left and right bleed air systems: - the primary motor is used for AUTOmatic mode.

The HPV, PRV, OPV and FAV are all controlled and operated pneumatically. The HPV, PRV, OPV and FAV are also connected to a dedicated reference pressure pneumatic Thermostat or solenoid. During troubleshooting, it is very important to check the integrity of all pneumatic sense-line connections, in between the valves and its thermostat or solenoid. The BMC monitors the system operation and shuts down the system in case of over temperature, over pressure or a Leak. The BMC BITE does not confirm the integrity of the system.

The waste water is discarded overboard outside through the drain valve and the drain mast. The two drain masts have integrated electrical heating elements to prevent ice formation in flight and during cold weather. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 16 of 112 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY SYSTEM OVERVIEW - WASTE WATER SYSTEM Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 17 of 112 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY WATER/WASTE SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) TOILET SYSTEM CONTROL AND INDICATING SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) TOILET SYSTEM The toilet system gives sanitary facilities for the passengers and crews. The system is a differential pressure toilet system and uses potable water for flushing. TOILET SYSTEM FLUSHING OPERATION The system uses potable water from the aircraft pressurized water system to flush the toilet. A flush valve opens to remove waste from the toilet bowl to an under floor waste holding tank. At high altitude, the differential pressure between the cabin and the atmospheres is sufficient to move the waste from the toilet bowl into the waste holding tank. At low altitude or on ground, a vacuum generator starts to give the necessary differential pressure in the waste system to move the waste from the bowl to the tank. The Vacuum System Controller Function (VSCF), integrated in the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS), controls the flushing system operation and stops the operation when the waste servicing panel is open. When the tank is full, the liquid level sensor stops the system operation. The vacuum toilet system is connected to the CIDS. The CIDS controls and monitors the system functions and the related electric components. A Flush Control Unit (FCU) per toilet controls the rinse and flush cycle as soon as the flush SW is pressed. The system uses potable water from the potable water system to rinse the toilet bowl. When the waste holding tank is full, a signal is sent to the CIDS, which shuts down the toilet systems. The FAP displays the waste tank quantity stored in the waste holding tank when the Water/Waste key on the FAP is selected. TOILET SYSTEM WASTE DISPOSAL The waste holding tank is installed on the right of the aircraft under the floor behind the bulk cargo compartment. The tank includes a water separator, a liquid level transmitter, a liquid level sensor, a waste drain valve and two rinse line connections. TOILET SYSTEM WASTE TANK HEATING (OPTIONAL) The waste holding tank can be insulated. The lines between the tank and the service panel with the waste drain valve can be insulated and heated.

The potable water tank has a capacity of 200 l (53 US gal). The quantity indication system indicates how much water is available in the potable water tank. The quantity transmitter transmits the signal to the indicator on the water service panel. It also sends the information to a Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B, which in turn interfaces with the active Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) director to display on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) the water tank contents in percentage of volume. The TANK FULL light on the service panel comes on when the tank is full. PRESSURIZATION Pressurization of the system enables water supply from the tank to the necessary service location. Compressed air is tapped from the cross feed line of the engine or APU bleed air. On ground, when the bleed air system is not available, the ground air pressure supply system is used. If installed, the air compressor will supply air when bleed is not available. During servicing, the overflow valve is used to depressurize the potable water tank. DISTRIBUTION Potable water from the water tank is supplied through a system of distribution lines, which are routed below the passenger compartment floor. A part of the forward distribution line goes through a hose for added protection of the avionics equipment. The potable water distribution lines are insulated and electrically heated to prevent ice formation in and around the lines. Each lavatory and each galley have an individual and manual shutoff valve. FILLING The Filling is achieved through a fill/drain valve operated by the fill/drain control handle on the potable water service panel. The fill/drain control handle simultaneously opens the electrically motorized overflow valve for venting. The quantity transmitter sends a tank-full signal to close the fill/drain valve automatically. Manual operation is possible via control handles dedicated to each valve. Maximum permissible pressure to fill the potable water tank is 50 psi (3.4 bars). CAUTION: WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER YOU MUST OPEN THE OVERFLOW VALVE MANUALLY PRIOR TO THE FILLING TO PREVENT WATER SPILLAGE IN THE CABIN. HEATING A water heater is installed under the wash basin inside the sanitary unit cabinet. If the quantity transmitter detects a low level into the water tank, it cuts the electrical supply of the water heater. A thermostat allows the water temperature to be maintained between 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) and 48 \u00b0C (118,4 \u00b0F). An over temperature safety device protects the heating element.

The quantity indication system indicates how much water is available in the potable water tank. The quantity transmitter transmits the signal to the indicator on the water service panel. It also sends the information to a Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B, which in turn interfaces with the active Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) director to display on the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) the water tank contents in percentage of volume. The TANK FULL light on the service panel comes on when the tank is full. PRESSURIZATION Compressed air is used to pressurize the system in order to supply water from the tank to the necessary service locations. The compressed air is tapped from the cross feed-line of the engine or APU bleed air and is connected to the water tank air inlet. On ground, when the bleed air system is not available, the ground air pressure supply system is used. If installed, an optional compressor is used for the pressurization in case of bleed air decrease. DISTRIBUTION Potable water from the water tank is supplied through a system of distribution lines, which are routed below the passenger compartment floor. A part of the forward distribution line goes through a hose for added protection of the avionics equipment. The potable water distribution lines are insulated and electrically heated to prevent ice formation in and around the lines. Each lavatory and each galley have an individual and manual shutoff valve. SERVICING The Servicing of the potable water system can be done with or without electrical power. With electrical power, the single fill/drain control handle mechanically operates the fill/overflow drain valve and electrically controls the forward drain valve. Without electrical power, the valves are individually operated by cables. The draining operation is accomplished by opening the fill/overflow drain valve and the forward drain valve. The filling operation is accomplished by opening the fill/overflow drain valve and closing the forward drain valve. When the tank is full, the quantity transmitter sends a signal to close the fill/overflow drain valve automatically. HEATING In each lavatory, a water heater is installed under the wash basin. If the quantity transmitter detects a low level into the water tank, it cuts the electrical supply of the water heater. A thermostat maintains the water temperature between 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) and 51.7\u00b0C (125\u00b0F). An over temperature safety device protects the heating element.

DRAIN ASSEMBLY Each lavatory wash basin has a drain assembly with a valve actuated by a control knob and a cable. NOTE: The control knob is operated by the lavatory user. DRAIN VALVE Each drain valve opens only when a certain amount of water is collected. This prevents a permanent loss of cabin air pressurization through the drain lines. DRAIN MAST In flight, differential pressure between the cabin and the drain mast outlet discards the waste water. On ground, gravity discards the waste water. The drain masts are electrically heated to prevent ice formation.

Differential pressure between the cabin and the atmosphere moves the waste from the toilet bowl to the waste holding tank. This difference of pressure can be caused by the vacuum generator or by aircraft pressurization. RINSE/FLUSH CONTROL A flush control unit per toilet controls the time and sequence of the toilet operation during the flushing cycle. VACUUM CONTROL A vacuum generator is connected to the aircraft power circuit through the motor starting relay. As soon as a FLUSH switch is pressed, the flush control unit sends an electrical signal, through the connected Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B to the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) directors, which activates the motor starting relay according to the altitude. The Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC) supplies altitude data to CIDS via the System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC). At high altitude, the CPC stops the electrical supply of the vacuum generator, the differential pressure between the cabin and the atmosphere being sufficient to move the waste from the toilet bowl to the waste holding tank.

GENERAL The toilet system removes waste from the toilet bowl through a vacuum drain to an underfloor waste holding tank. The vacuum toilet system is connected to the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS), which controls and monitors the system function and the related electric components. The system uses potable water from the potable water system to flush the toilet. FLUSHING When the FLUSH switch is pressed, the flush control unit initiates the flush sequence. The vacuum generator starts to operate and after 1.6 seconds the water valve opens for 1.7 seconds. Then, the flush valve, controlled by the flush control unit, opens for 4 seconds to evacuate the waste material through differential pressure. VACUUM As soon as the FLUSH switch is pressed, the flush control unit sends an electrical signal to the CIDS (via the connected Decoder/Encoder Unit (DEU) B), which operates the vacuum generator for approximately 15 seconds. The vacuum generator creates the necessary differential pressure between the cabin and the waste holding tank to move the waste from the toilet bowl. The vacuum generator is activated: - on ground, - during climb when the differential pressure is less than 246 mbar, - during descent when the differential pressure is less than 203 mbar. The different pressure information is supplied by the Cabin Pressure Controller (CPC) via the System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC). NOTE: The landing gear signal is used as a back- up in case the SDAC can not deliver altitude/ diff. press information. It overrides the Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) STORAGE The waste holding tank is installed on the right hand side of the aircraft under the floor between FRame 65 and FR 68. The tank has a capacity of 170 l (44.9 US gal). The tank has: - a water separator, - a liquid level transmitter (hydrostatic pressure), - a liquid level sensor (ultrasonic type), - waste inlets, - a waste outlet, - two rinse nozzles. CONTROL/MONITORING The waste system data is received by DEUs B and sent to the CIDS directors (DIRs). This system is controlled and monitored by the Vacuum System Controller (VSC) function, which is integrated inside the CIDS DIRs. The CIDS DIRs also report the vacuum toilet system failures to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). INDICATING The waste holding tank is equipped with a liquid level transmitter and a liquid level sensor. When the tank is full, a signal is sent to the CIDS DIRs through the DEU B,on Middle Line databus, which shuts down the toilet systems. The signal is also sent to the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) through the DIRs and a \"WASTE TANK NOT EMPTY-CHECK LEVEL GROUND SERVICE REQUIRED\" message is displayed. SERVICING The waste holding tank is serviced from a service panel, which is located on the right of the lower fuselage between FR 65 and FR 66. It has: CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 77 of 112 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY - a drain connection, - a rinse/flush connection, - a waste drain valve control handle, - a limit switch. During servicing, the flush control units are automatically de-activated. Thus, toilet use is inhibited during servicing. The waste drain control handle mechanically operates the drain valve.

The modularity concept for the software (S/W) makes easy data link capability during all Communication Navigation Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) transitions. The ATSU S/W is partitioned into two main parts: - aircraft interface/host platform and, - data link applications. AIRCRAFT INTERFACE/HOST PLATFORM SOFTWARE - hosted AOC applications. For the remote AOC applications, the ATSU only routes data to and from AOC peripherals. This routing is in charge of receiving ground messages and routing them to the right AOC peripheral and acquiring messages or reports from these peripherals and sending them to the ground. The hosted applications depend on airline definition and uploaded into the ATSU. These applications include standard and customized functions. The main functions are: - AOC menu display, - processing, printing and display of received messages, - generation, triggering and sending of messages. The aircraft interface/host platform S/W is composed of four services: - air/ground communication, used for the management of the air/ground communication media, - Human-Machine Interface (HMI), used for the management of the CNS/ATM cockpit interfaces: MCDU, printer and alert function, - on-board peripherals, used for the management of the communication with the on-board peripheral units: Data Management Unit (DMU) part of the Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU), Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), Flight Management System (FMS) and cabin terminal, - system management, used for the acquisition of the aircraft parameters for application S/W use and monitoring of the system: power supply and BITE functions. DATA LINK APPLICATION The data link applications include only Airline Operational Control (AOC) for the pre-Future Air Navigation System (FANS) configuration. The AOC applications are dedicated to data communication services between the aircraft and the airline facility. The AOC is composed of: - remote AOC applications and, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 6 of 40 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY ATSU - AIRCRAFT INTERFACE/HOST PLATFORM SOFTWARE & DATA LINK APPLICATION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 7 of 40 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY ATIMS DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) ATSU SOFTWARE LOADING The ATSU S/W is uploaded via the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU). If a complete S/W uploading is required, a de-selection of the ATSU data loading must be carried out, for each type of S/W, so that a re-initialization of the ATSU can be made until the DATALINK ATSU FAULT warning goes off on the EWD.

APU or Ground Cart supply can be used for interactive test on Ground. The CSAS gets bleed air from the Engine Bleed Air System and does its conditioning for the IGGS. First, the ozone converter decreases the quantity of ozone in the bleed air to give protection to the IGGS components. Then, the air temperature is decreased by the CSAS heat exchanger to get a temperature of 60\u00b0C+/-6\u00b0C. TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE CONTROL The bypass valve is installed in the heat exchanger bypass duct and is controlled by the CSAS. The bypass valve adds hot air downstream of the heat exchanger to maintain the temperature within limits. On the output duct, a dual element temperature sensor and a pressure sensor monitor the temperature and the pressure before they go into the IGGS. If there is over-pressure or over-temperature, the CSAS isolation valve closes to stop the system.

It does the system control and health monitoring BITE and has interfaces with the Flight Warning System (FWS) and the maintenance computer. If a failure of the CSAS system occurs, the status message \"INERT FAULT\" will come into view only in flight phase 1 and 10, for maintenance. NOTE: The MEL tells that the A/C can be dispatched with the system unserviceable for 10 days with no maintenance procedure. The CSAS Controller is interconnected between Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) and Engine Interface Units (EIUs) to keep a minimum bleed pressure during descent.

The IGGS uses an Air Separation Module (ASM) to remove oxygen from the conditioned air stream. This makes and separates the Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA) and the Oxygen Enriched Air (OEA). The OEA is sent overboard. The Dual Flow Shut Off Valve (DFSOV) controls the NEA flow to the center fuel tank, lets the system change between low/middle/high NEA flow and isolates the IGGS from the center fuel tank. The IGGS controller supplies system control and health monitoring/BITE. The IGGS isolation valve is a solenoid valve. It is spring-loaded closed. During operation, the IGGS Controller Unit (ICU) controls the valve to open, to let conditioned air from CSAS to the IGGS. It closes if too low a pressure and/or overtemperature air come from the heat exchanger.

Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 16 of 31 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL - SAFETY PRECAUTION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 17 of 31 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY INERT GAS GENERATION SYSTEM D/O (3) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION To inert the center fuel tank and to control and monitor the IGGS, the IGGS includes: - one IGGS Isolation Gate Valve, - one D-ULPA (Double ultra low particle) filter, - one temperature sensor, - two pressure transmitters (inlet and outlet of the ASM), - one oxygen sensor at the outlet of the ASM, - one Air Separation Module (ASM), - one Dual Flow Shut Off Valve (DFSOV), - one dual flapper check valve, - one IGGS Controller Unit (ICU). SYSTEM OPERATION NORMAL OPERATION The bleed air comes from the CSAS and it is filtered by the D-ULPA filter to keep the ASM inlet clean, without hydrocarbons and dust. Downstream of the D-ULPA filter, one temperature sensor and one pressure sensor send air parameters to the ICU. The ASM, which is the core of the IGGS, removes oxygen and sends NEA to the center fuel tank. The OEA is sent overboard through an outlet on the HPGC door. Downstream of the ASM, an oxygen sensor measures the oxygen rate to prevent a high oxygen concentration in the center fuel tank. The oxygen sensor has a pressure sensing capability when it is energized and thus it prevents over-pressure in the center fuel tank. The DFSOV controls the NEA flow to the center fuel tank and lets the system change between low/mid/high NEA flow in relation to the flight phases. The DFSOV also isolates the IGGS from the center fuel tank if an abnormal operation occurs. A Dual Flapper Check Valve makes a double barrier to the possible back-flow of fuel.

It is located in the unpressurized tail cone. The APU is a self-contained unit, which enables the aircraft to be independent of external pneumatic and electrical power sources. The constant-speed gas turbine engine drives the accessory gearbox and a load compressor. The APU provides: - electrical power for the aircraft systems, - bleed air for engine starting (MES), air conditioning (ECS) and wing anti ice testing on ground (not GTCP 36-300), - bleed air for air conditioning and pressurization in flight until the specified manufacturer limit. The APU is designed to operate throughout the entire flight envelope. Electrical power is available whenever the APU operates, but bleed air is shut off above the specified manufacturer limit. The APU has an air intake flap. The intake flap is open when the APU master switch is selected ON and closes when the master switch is selected OFF. When open, it provides air to the APU inlet for combustion and pneumatic supply.

Two access doors allow access to the APU COMPT. The access doors on the bottom of the tail cone open outwards to allow the APU to be inspected, lifted and lowered. MOUNTS Seven tie rods attach the APU to the structure brackets on the APU COMPT ceiling. These tie rods also connect to the APU three-point mounted suspension system. Vibration isolators are installed between the APU mount brackets and the tie rods to reduce the transmission of A/C vibrations and shocks to the APU. The isolators also prevent the transmission of vibrations from the APU to the A/C structure. DRAIN SYSTEM A drain system prevents the collection of fluids in the APU COMPT. Any fluid that may accumulate in the APU COMPT is delivered to a drain mast. Some of the fluids are collected in a drain tank in the APU COMPT, which is emptied through the drain mast when the A/C is above 200 kt. AIR INTAKE FLAP The air intake system ducts ambient air to the APU plenum chamber. An air intake flap cuts off the air supply when the APU does not operate. In case of failure, the air intake flap can be opened or closed manually by a manual override device. AIR INTAKE DUCT The air intake duct, which is composed of a diffuser and elbow, provides correct airflow to the APU plenum. The air intake duct is attached to the right access door. EXHAUST The exhaust system lets the APU exhaust gas flow into the atmosphere and muffles the noise from the exhaust. The exhaust muffler thermal insulation protects the A/C structure.

A turbine plenum drain orifice is provided to drain fuel that may accumulate in the combustor following an unsuccessful light-up. The fuel is drained directly overboard through the drain mast. FUEL CONTROL UNIT/OIL PUMP SEAL DRAIN The fuel and oil pump seal drain line is routed via a collector line to the drain tank. This line drains fuel or oil leaks. INLET GUIDE VANE ACTUATOR DRAIN The Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) actuator drain line is routed via the collector line to the drain tank. This line drains only fuel leaks. GEARBOX VENT The oil reservoir has a connection to the ambient air through an air/oil separator. The gear driven air/oil separator is connected through a gearbox vent line to the APU exhaust cone. SURGE CONTROL VALVE DRAIN The surge control valve fuel is drained into the drain tank by the Fuel Control Unit (FCU)/IGV actuator common drain line. LOAD COMPRESSOR CAVITY DRAIN EXHAUST MUFFLER DRAIN The exhaust muffler drain line is routed to the drain mast. This drain line collects water or cleaning fluid. APU COMPARTMENT DRAIN Water coming from rain or condensate humidity, cleaning agents and any oil and fuel in the compartment, due to leaks or APU servicing, are drained to the lowest point of the APU door and through the drain mast overboard. DRAIN TANK For venting and evacuation, the drain tank is connected to the drain mast. Airflow across the drain mast creates a vacuum in the drain line. The suction effect produced at 200 kts, is sufficient to remove the contents of the drain tank. A vent line ventilates the drain tank and drain lines. The APU drain lines are connected to the right access door drain lines through spring adapter kiss seals. To prevent any ingestion of oil in the bleed system the load compressor bearing cavities are kept dry by buffering air into the main shaft seals. An oil leak witness drain is located aft of the seal to collect any oil leakage. The oil is drained directly overboard through the drain mast.

The main parts of the combustion chamber are: - the inner combustion chamber shell, - the outer combustion chamber shell. The following components are installed on the combustion chamber: - an igniter plug, - 10 dual orifice fuel nozzles. TURBINE The load compressor is of a single-stage centrifugal design. It supplies bleed air to the pneumatic system. The primary components of the load compressor are: - the inlet guide vane assembly, - the load compressor impeller, - the load compressor diffuser, - the load compressor scroll. The shaft is held with two bearings: one duplex ball bearing in front of the load compressor impellor and one roller bearing aft of the second-stage turbine. As an option, the duplex ball bearing is made of ceramic to make the bearing more resistant to damage caused by debris that go into the bearing compartment. INLET GUIDE VANES The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) control the amount of bleed air flow and pressure from the APU load compressor. The 16 IGVs are moved simultaneously by a gear train operated by an actuator. The IGV actuator is operated by high-pressure fuel supplied from the Fuel Control Unit (FCU). The IGV opening angle depends on the bleed air demand for: - Main Engine Start (MES) system, - Environmental Control System (ECS). ACCESSORY GEARBOX The turbine assembly drives the engine compressor, the load compressor and the gear train of the Accessory Gearbox (AGB). The two-stage axial flow turbine includes: - a cooled first stage nozzle, - inserted first stage rotor blades, - an un cooled second stage stator, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) LOAD COMPRESSOR The gearbox transmits the shaft power to the APU accessories and to the APU generator, which are installed on the gearbox pads.

When the APU speed is around 50%, the Electronic Control Box (ECB) stops the electrical supply to the starter by opening the main start contactor. The main start contactor 5KA and the backup start contactor 10KA are heavy duty contactors that switch electrical current to the starter motor. During Ram Air Turbine (RAT) extension, APU starting is inhibited by the Battery Charge Limiters (BCL 1 and BCL 2), which prevent operation of the main start contactor 5 KA by removing the necessary ground signal, to operate the Main Start Contactor, from the MASTER SW. IGNITION CONTROL The ignition system causes initial light-off of the fuel air mixture. The ignition system includes an ignition box that energizes an igniter plug. During starting, the ECB switches the ignition to ON between 0% and 60%. When the APU speed drops below 95% due to a flame-out, the ECB starts the ignition until the APU reaches again 100% of speed.

The valve is energized open during every APU shutdown between 50% and 7% speed. GENERAL The oil system of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) lubricates and decreases the temperature of the power section, load compressor, gearbox and AC generator. This system is made of: - storage, - supply, - scavenge, - venting, - control, - protection, - monitoring. PROTECTION The ECB gives protection to the APU if there is an oil system malfunction. The ECB monitors oil pressure and oil temperature. If one of the oil parameters is out of limit, the ECB starts an automatic APU shutdown without time delay: - gearbox high oil temp threshold: 162.78\u00b0C (325\u00b0F), - oil low pressure: 33 psi. The ECB also stops the APU if a delta pressure switch at the scavenge filter or at the lubrication filter shows impending filter clogging. STORAGE MONITORING The sump of the APU Accessory Gearbox (AGB) is the oil reservoir. The AGB sump contains 6.26 l (1.65 US gal) of oil. The oil reservoir can be filled by gravity or by pressure. The AGB has: - an oil fill cap for gravity filling, - optional pressure oil servicing with a pressure fill and overfill port, - an oil-level sight glass with FULL and ADD marks, - a magnetic chip detector and oil drain plug installed at the lowest point of the AGB, - an oil heater. The oil system is monitored to increase the APU life. The oil sump is installed with a low-level switch to show maintenance information in the cockpit. When the level is at the \"ADD\" mark 4.60 l (1.22 US gal), the APU can continue to operate for 10 hours maximun. This changes with the different operating attitudes of the A/C in flight. A magnetic drain plug, put fully in the APU oil, lets the oil drain from the sump and attracts ferrous metal particles. CONTROL The Electronic Control Box (ECB) only controls the de-oiling valve in the oil system. The de-oiling solenoid valve is electrically opened during APU start to make sure of cold start conditions and to decrease the load on the pressure pump. The solenoid valve is open during start-up to 60% RPM when: - the oil sump temperature is below -6.7\u00b0C (+20\u00b0F), Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) OIL HEATER (OPTION) The control of the oil heater is independent of the ECB. When the oil temperature is below 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) and the APU master switch is released out, the heater is supplied with 115VAC. The oil heater is switched off when the oil temperature increases above 49\u00b0C (120 \u00b0F) or the master switch is selected ON. The oil heater is an option.

A pressure-regulating valve and ultimate-relief valve assembly keeps a constant lube supply pressure for oil supply to the engine and generator and prevents over-pressurization of the lube system. Pressure-regulated oil goes through a cooler and a disposable filter. The bypass valve opens at an oil temperature below 60\u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) or when there is a differential pressure between 55 - 60 psi around the oil cooler. The oil is then sent to the cooling fan splines, the APU spline shaft, the APU supporting bearings rear and front, the gearbox pinions and the electrical AC generator.

The quantity changes with the different bleed air demands of the pneumatic system. This system includes: - bleed supply, - bleed control, - surge protection, - oil cooling, - compartment cooling, - oil vent, - control, - monitoring. BLEED SUPPLY Bleed air supply to the A/C pneumatic system is controlled by a load control valve. The pneumatically-actuated CLOSE/OPEN butterfly valve, which allows or stops the bleed airflow from the APU to the A/C users, is controlled by the Electronic Control Box (ECB) and opens when the APU BLEED P/BSW is set to the ON position. The \"APU BLEED\" P/B sends \"ON\" signal to the ECB via the Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC). BLEED CONTROL The quantity of air necessary to the aircraft bleed users is controlled by the opening angle of the load compressor Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs). The IGVs are moved by a fuel-powered actuator (IGC-Actuator). Pressurized fuel is supplied by the internal pressure regulator part of the APU Fuel Control Unit. SURGE PROTECTION is hydraulically operated for accurate and fast operation. The hydraulic fluid is high pressure fuel from the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) with approximately 250 psig. OIL COOLING A gearbox-driven fan draws air from the inlet plenum and forces it to pass through the oil cooler. After leaving the oil cooler, the air is discharged overboard. COMPARTMENT COOLING Air supplied by the fan, driven by one of the gears of the gearbox, is also used for APU compartment cooling. Cooling air flows through the outlets located on the cooling fan outlet duct. Natural convection ventilates the APU compartment through a vent grill in the upper left area of the compartment when the APU is not in operation. OIL VENT The gearbox is vented to the APU exhaust. The air is bled after an air/oil separator action. CONTROL The ECB controls the air system using several parameters from the following components installed on the APU: - APU inlet pressure (P2) and temperature (T2) sensors, - load compressor discharge pressure sensor (PT) and differential pressure sensor (DP), - command and feedback signals from the actuators and the valves (IGV actuator, Load Control Valve and Surge Control Valve), - A/C demands: Main Engine Start (MES) and Environmental Control System (ECS). Load compressor surge protection is ensured by a surge control valve, which discharges the excess of air in the exhaust.

The fuel-operated bleed control valve is a diverter valve: either to the A/C system and/or the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) exhaust. Pressurized air enters the gearbox during operation from the front and rear bearing seal buffering systems. This air comes from the power section compressor. The gearbox is vented to the APU exhaust. The oil mist is separated from the vent air by an air-oil separator. CONTROL NOTE: the hydraulic fluid is high pressure fuel from the Fuel Control Unit pressure regulator part with a pressure of approximately 250 psig. BLEED CONTROL The quantity of air necessary for the aircraft bleed users is controlled by the opening angles of the load compressor Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs). The IGVs are moved by a fuel-powered actuator. SURGE PROTECTION Load compressor surge protection is done by the bleed control valve that discharges the excess of air in the exhaust. OIL COOLING A gearbox-driven fan draws air from the inlet plenum and forces it to go through the oil cooler. After leaving the oil cooler, the air is discharged overboard. The cooling fan incorporates a Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), which supplies a direct current to the Electronic Control Box (ECB), if the main supply is interrupted, for a maximum of 230ms. The ECB controls the air system using several parameters: - signals from the APU inlet pressure and temperature sensor, - signals from the load compressor discharge pressure sensor and the differential pressure sensor, - command and feedback signals from the fuel driven actuators. MONITORING The compressor discharge pressure sensor is a unit, which contains a static pressure and a differential pressure sensor. It is located at the APU air intake plenum. The ECB uses the sensor output voltage for the calculation of the compressor air flow and to give the APU BLEED pressure indication for the APU page on the lower ECAM display unit. To help maintenance and troubleshooting, the bleed control valve has a visual position indicator. COMPARTMENT COOLING Air supplied by the fan, which is driven by one of the gears of the gearbox, is also used for the APU compartment cooling. The compartment cooling air is blown through a smaller duct attached to the fan discharge tube. Natural convection ventilates the APU compartment when the APU is not in operation.

The BCV servo valve receives a command signal from the ECB to let the BCV open the duct for Aircraft Pneumatic System supply and to let bleed air flow into the supply duct. To make sure that a pressure build-up occurs in the Aircraft Bleed supply duct, the ECB first commands the Bleed Control Valve (BCV) to the exhaust duct closed position and then modulates the BCV to prevent surge conditions. The BCV uses an LVDT for position feedback transmission to the ECB.

SPEED CONTROL This function keeps the rotation speed of the APU rotating assembly constant, whatever the load applied. This is achieved by metering the fuel flow, which varies with the air inlet pressure and temperature. LOAD COMPRESSOR CONTROL This function opens the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) according to the bleed air demand from the A/C, ECS or MES. Protection against load compressor surge is achieved by controlling and reading the position of the bleed control valve, according to the inlet temperature, and differential and discharge pressure signals of the load compressor (DELTA P/P ratio). If the ECB detects a surge condition, the bleed control valve is positioned to discharge air to the exhaust. NOTE: 1: In case of failure of the load compressor control, the IGVs are closed and the bleed control valve is fully opened to discharge. 2: In case of detected reverse flow operation, the APU is automatically shut down by the ECB. EGT CONTROL This function avoids APU over temperature by controlling the Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) position to closed. Thus, the pneumatic load is first reduced to give priority to the electrical load. This is achieved by controlling the position of the IGVs to the closed position as a function of the EGT as long as the over temperature condition is present. NOTE: In case of IGV control failure, the IGVs are closed.

This function runs the APU at a low stabilized temperature before normal shutdown. NORMAL SHUTDOWN An APU normal shutdown is initiated when the MASTER SW P/B is released out. If the APU bleed air is not selected, the APU shuts down immediately. The normal shutdown signal stops the fuel supply. This causes the APU to decelerate. The AVAIL indication goes off and the AC generator de-energizes. When the speed is less than 90% rpm, the gearbox de-oil solenoid valve opens. When the speed is less than 7% rpm, the air intake flap is controlled to fully close and the de-oiling solenoid valve is de-energized to close.

The ECB receives the flight/ground discrete input signal from the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1. MASTER SWITCH P/B The ECB receives a discrete signal from the APU low fuel pressure switch. It sends a discrete signal to the APU fuel LP Shut-Off Valve (SOV). The APU MASTER SWitch sends a discrete supply or stop signal to the ECB. The ECB sends a discrete signal to the FAULT light when an automatic or emergency shutdown occurs or a power-up test fails. APU FUEL FEED SYSTEM EIU The ECB sends a power output for opening or closing the air intake flap and receives an air intake flap open or closed position signal. During engine starts, the ECB receives a Main Engine Start (MES) signal from Engine Interface Units (EIUs) 1 or 2. This signal causes the ECB to position the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) to the fully open position and the bleed control valve to modulate in delivery position. START P/B BMC A discrete input signal from the START P/B initiates the starting sequences. The ECB sends a discrete signal to the ON light during the APU start sequence. A discrete output signal to the A/C energizes the AVAIL light in the START P/B when the APU speed is above 95% rpm. When the APU bleed P/B is set to ON, Bleed Monitoring Computers (BMCs) 1 or 2 send a discrete input to the ECB which controls the opening of the APU bleed control valve. ECB sends discrete output signal to the BMCs to indicate when the BCV is not in the closed position. BACK-UP AND MAIN START CONTACTORS TSO/JAR The ECB sends discrete output signals to the back-up and the main start contactors and receives as a feedback a discrete input from the main start contactor. The ECB receives a discrete input from the A/C signature PIN programming. This open or ground signal determines whether the ECB follows the Technical Standard Order (TSO) or the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR). AIR INTAKE FLAP EMERGENCY STOP A discrete input signal from the A/C initiates the APU emergency shutdown logic after the ECB has received this signal. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM (ECS) The ECB receives, via an ARINC 429 bus, an input from the Air conditioning System Controller 1 and 2 (ACSC) to control the IGVs CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 181 of 206 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY position according to the demand. The ECB sends a discrete output to the ACSC 1 and 2 to signal that the APU bleed valve is in delivery position. A320/A321 IDENTIFICATION The ECB receives a discrete input from the A/C signature PIN programming. This identification PIN lets the ECB identify the A321 applications for functional differences from those of an A320. GENERATOR OIL TEMPERATURE SENSOR The ECB receives an analog input from this sensor which is a component mounted on the AC generator. SDAC The ECB sends to the System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) 1 and 2, via ARINC 429 data buses, the indications to show on the ECAM APU page and shutdown information to trigger the related warnings. CFDS The ECB is a BITE type 1 computer and is connected to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) via ARINC 429 data buses.

SERVICING APU OIL SERVICING APU oil servicing is accomplished on an \"as-needed\" basis or after scheduled oil quantity checks. The oil indicating system shows if the oil quantity is sufficient or if an oil servicing is necessary. The oil level information is displayed on the EIS and the Multipurpose Control & Display Units (MCDUs) in the cockpit on: - the APU page on the lower ECAM display unit (LOW OIL LEVEL advisory), - the APU SERVICE DATA page on the MCDU, indicating APU OIL Level O.K. or LOW. NOTE: Note: The advisory appears on the ECAM APU page when the oil level has reached the ADD mark on the APU oil tank. Airbus recommends servicing the APU oil at the next daily maintenance when the LOW OIL LEVEL message comes on. With no oil leakage, sufficient oil is available to allow a further 10 hours of APU operation. Prior to servicing, shut down the APU and open the APU cowl doors. Make sure to use the operator approved oil for servicing (operators may select from the approved list). The oil may be serviced by the gravity (most common) or pressure fill procedure (optional). Gravity procedure: - Open the lock and slowly loosen the oil filler cap to release remaining pressure from the oil reservoir, - Check sight glass for level, - Slowly add oil until the level is at the FULL mark on the sight glass. Pressure fill procedure: - Check sight glass for level, - Connect pressure and overfill lines to APU gearbox, - Slowly pump oil into the gearbox until the level is at the FULL mark on the sight glass.

The APU will only be operational with the inlet deactivated OPEN (for a maximum of 10 days). The air inlet actuator is equipped with a manual drive. In case of failure the manual drive may be used to move the inlet to the required position prior to deactivation. There are 2 different actuators that may be installed. One requires 47 turns of the manual drive for one full travel of the inlet. The other requires 87 turns. Access to the actuator is through an access door near the APU inlet on the right hand side of the fuselage. Deactivation procedure: - get access to the actuator, - disconnect the actuator electrical connector from the fixed connector on the frame and install a blanking cap, - use the manual drive to move the inlet to the required position. Use a torque wrench to avoid damaging the actuator. If the inlet is deactivated CLOSED, no further action is needed other than to placard the APU inoperative. If the inlet is deactivated OPEN, the following procedure has to be accomplished. When the inlet is in the OPEN position, a jumper lead needs to be installed to close the circuit and allow the APU to start. Make a dummy connector and paint it red for easy identification.

The drain valve is located in the APU compartment in the fuel supply line to the fuel control. A switch labeled FUEL VENT PUSH is installed on the APU compartment forward firewall to allow maintenance to operate the APU fuel pump and purge the fuel line from the APU compartment. This switch allows the APU pump to operate and the APU Low Pressure fuel valve to open without the APU Master Switch ON. A drain valve adapter tool is connected to the drain valve. On the front firewall of the APU compartment: - Push and hold the FUEL VENT pushbutton switch. At the APU fuel vent and drain valve, a continuous flow of fuel indicates that the APU fuel pump is operating and the line is purged, - Release the FUEL VENT pushbutton switch. The flow of fuel stops when the APU fuel pump stops running, - Disconnect the adapter tool.

To open one of the two emergency exit hatches from the inside, pull down the cover flap from the recess. A slide armed indicator illuminates to show that the escape slide release mechanism is in the armed configuration. To disarm the mechanism, turn the retractable pin a quarter turn anticlockwise. This is confirmed by the extinguishing of the slide armed indicator. Pull the lever of the hatch control handle to the down position. Carefully let the top of the hatch fall inwards so that it comes clear of the structure. Take the lower handle and pull the hatch from the recess. A red manual handle can be used to activate the escape slide release mechanism manually. Install a rigging pin in the provision of the hatch frame. A ditching line attachment point housed in the door frame, and a dual point on the wing upper surface enable the ditching line to be connected. Training Point:There have been several reported incidents of doors being opening with excessive cabin pressure present. this results in the door pushing outwards at speed and with force, causing injury. Introduction of new labels on the door area give additional recommendations to minimize the possibility of cabin residual pressure during ground air supply This improves awareness to reduce risk of aircraft damage and/or injury to persons during operation of the ground air supply. This is embodied by the following SB A320-11-1097: Install additional warning label LP/HP ground connection adjacent to access panels (Mod. 157025).

Thus the hatch is a pure plug type door. The pressure load on the hatch is transferred along the stop profiles via the seal into the fuselage skin. The material of the outer skin is aluminum alloy. Its thickness has been reduced locally by chemical etching for weight saving purpose. When the passenger compartment is pressurized, the pressure loads are transferred into the fuselage structure via the two extruded stop profiles which are riveted to the vertical edge members. At the vertical stop profiles, the retaining channel is integrated in the extruded parts. HORIZONTAL BEAMS The structure includes an aluminum alloy forged frame, which is identical to a passenger window frame. The horizontal beams are acting as stiffeners for the outer skin, they prevent a large deflection of the outer skin. The horizontal beams are made from aluminum formed sheet metal. SEAL WINDOW The seal is retained by a formed sheet metal retaining channel, which is riveted to the hatch structure. The hatch seal is a fabric reinforced silicone rubber lip-type seal. FRAME SEGMENTS Like the horizontal beams, the frame segments are acting as stiffeners for the outer skin. They are also made from aluminum formed sheet metal. It includes aluminum alloy formed sheet vertical frame segments. INNER SKIN The inner skin maintains the position of frame segments and horizontal beams and prevents them from buckling on the inside. The inner skin consists of several segments. These segments are made from aluminum formed sheet metal. EDGE MEMBERS The purpose of the edge members is to stiffen the skin at its edges and to maintain torsion stiffness of the exit door structure.

When the spring-loaded latch pin is extended it is in the ARMED position, and when the latch pin is retracted it is in the DISARMED position. The slide release mechanism includes the guiding fitting, the spring and the latch pin. For maintenance purposes, the latch pin can be disarmed by turning it counter-clockwise. The lateral guides put the hatch in the center position during the installation. A lateral guide fitting is attached on each vertical edge member of the emergency exit hatch. LOCKING SHAFT UNIT The locking shaft unit includes the two locking hooks and the locking shaft. A connection rod attaches the hatch handle to the locking shaft. CONTROL HANDLE The hatch control handle has two tension springs which retain the handle in the up position. When the hatch control is released, the connection causes a movement of the locking shaft unit. LOCKING HOOKS Inside or outside operation of the control handles locks or unlocks the hatch. When the emergency exit hatch is correctly locked, the locked hooks engage in the upper roller fittings. LOWER ROLLER The lower rollers put the emergency exit hatch in line with the fuselage during the installation. The lower roller brackets, attached on the hatch bottom beam, engage in their pivot fitting.

Two emergency exit doors are installed on each side of the cabin, two FWD of the wing leading edge and two aft of the wing trailing edge. The operation is similar to that of the normal passenger doors. The FWD left emergency exit door is larger in size than the others and is known as a 73\" door. The three other emergency exit doors are 60\" doors. Door operation from outside or inside and in emergency is identical for all the emergency doors. The emergency exit door is installed with a support arm and two guide arms which maintain the door parallel to the fuselage in operation. The door mechanism is manually operated, it locks and keeps the door in the safety closed position. It also unlocks and lifts the door before you can move the unlocked door to the open position. The primary components of the door locking mechanism are: - the door handle mechanism, - the locking shaft mechanism, - the balance mechanism, - the lifting mechanism. The lifting mechanism will lock, unlock the door and operate the lifting mechanism. This moves the door up so that the lateral guide rollers come free from the fuselage guide fittings. A balance mechanism decreases the force necessary to operate the lifting mechanism. The door moves inwards, upwards and forward parallel to the fuselage and is locked by a mechanical lock in the open position. The door lock open mechanism is installed on the support arm. To close the door, operate the release button so that the spring-loaded linkage releases the locking hook. The escape slide-release mechanism operates the automatic inflation system. There are two modes: - the ARMED mode for the emergency door operation, - the DISARMED mode for normal door operation. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 The DISARMED mode allows the door to be manually opened without escape slide operation. When the door is opened from the inside of the cabin in the ARMED mode the emergency operation cylinder releases nitrogen to assist the door into its fully open position. The cylinder is shown in maintenance position with the safety pin installed. The escape slide-release mechanism operates the automatic inflation system to inflate the escape slide installed below the door. When the door is unlocked from the outside in the ARMED mode the escape slide-release mechanism is automatically DISARMED. The door damper hydraulically limits the speed of the door under normal operating conditions. Under emergency conditions the door damper acts as an actuator to open the door rapidly. To initiate emergency operation, the release lever is raised by door upward movement. The percussion mechanism breaks the diaphragm of the pressure accumulator and causes the nitrogen gas from the pressure accumulator to extend the actuator piston rod. A pressure gage and pressure switch are mounted on the pressure accumulator. The pressure gage has a red, yellow and green indicator area to show the actual pressure in the gas cylinder. The pressure switch relays a signal to the CIDS if pressure is low. Two proximity switches monitor the locked/unlocked condition and the DISARMED/ARMED condition of the door. One proximity sensor, which is part of the escape slide warning system, transmits a signal to the ECAM system. It gives a warning in the cockpit on the lower ECAM display panel when a door is opened in the ARMED mode. At the same time the white indicator light SLIDE ARMED located near the door window comes on. The other proximity sensor is part of the door warning system and also transmits a signal to the ECAM system. It shows on the lower ECAM display panel, when the door is unlocked. An additional proximity sensor and target is installed in the fuselage above the door. This sensor is part of the door warning system and monitors the OPEN/CLOSE position on the ECAM page. Now is shown the door ECAM page, door 1 LH side locked and slide armed. All the doors in green are locked and in amber open. The red warning light CABIN PRESSURE near the window flashes on ground if the door is in CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 52 of 167 DISARMED mode and there is a difference between the inside and outside pressure with the two engines off. Before opening the door, check warning lights. Now we will show the emergency exit door in more detail. The structural door components are made of aluminum alloy, they are riveted together to give the door its rigidity. Integrated in the door skin is the exterior handle and window. The door has two hoisting points integrated in the frame segments above the door centerline. The door seal is an extruded rubber seal profile with equally-spaced pressurization holes. When the cabin is pressurized, the door seal inflates and makes the door pressure-tight. Blankets are installed in the interspace of the primary structure for sound and thermal protection. They are attached with Velcro tapes on the inner face of the outer skin. The primary components of the escape slide-release mechanism are: - the arm/disarm unit, - the release assembly. Here is shown the operation of the components. The doorstop assemblies include the adjustable stops and the related stop fittings. The guide assembly contains the guide rollers and the related guide fittings. Here we see its operation during door movement.

When the cabin is pressurized, the outer skin carries the whole internal pressure on this area. The observation window permits the door warning to be checked from outside. LONGERON The horizontal longerons are stiffening elements for the outer skin and there are vertical frame segments. They also act as load concentrators: the pressure load on the skin is concentrated on the ends of the seven horizontal longerons, where the door stops are located. Longerons and outer skin edge members are riveted together. DOOR STOPS The loads resulting from the cabin pressure are transmitted by adjustable stops into the door frame and into the fuselage structure. The door stops are made from forged titanium. GUIDE ROLLERS The guide rollers, mounted on the door frame, guide the door movement precisely from its lifted to its lowered position and vice versa, preventing any unintended collision. They move within the guide ramps, which are mounted on the fuselage frame. Guide rollers and guide fittings also block the door in the closed position. The guide rollers engage in a ramp to block the door. Two additional guide rollers, located only on the aft edge of each door, prevent door jamming when loaded with extreme forces. SEAL The door seal consists of a rubber extrusion with equally spaced pressurization holes. The door seal is installed around the edge of the door and a sealing section is fitted onto the door frame.

It is composed of: - the door handle mechanism, - the locking shaft mechanism, - the balance mechanism, - the lifting mechanism. The lifting mechanism is installed in the lower section of the door. It is composed of the lifting shaft assembly, the door detent shaft and the adjustment lever unit. DOOR HANDLE MECHANISM The door handle mechanism is composed of the inboard handle assembly and the outboard handle assembly. The inboard handle and the outboard handle are connected to the internal control shaft and operate the locking shaft mechanism and the lifting mechanism. The control mechanism disarms the slide release mechanism when the external handle is moved. LOCKING SHAFT MECHANISM The locking shaft is locked in an overcentered position. An arm on the locking shaft forms the visual locking indicator. The locking shaft is connected to the locking hook by a connection rod. A spring unit is installed between the twin lever and the door structure. It makes sure that the locking shaft mechanism is always in the overcentered position. BALANCE MECHANISM The balance mechanism is installed in the lower section of the door. It is composed of the torsion bar assembly, the pretension unit and the connection rod.

It is installed to prevent or delay forced access to the cockpit from the cabin. It has reinforced door-attachment fittings and a bullet-proof door that is resistant to intrusion and penetration. It also has a Cockpit Door System (CDLS). Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 112 of 167 GENERAL Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 113 of 167 COCKPIT DOOR D/O (3) DESCRIPTION DOOR The cockpit door opens into the cockpit and a magnetic door stop keeps it in its fully open position. The cockpit door structure is a honeycomb core bonded between pre-impregnated sheets. On the cockpit door there is an upper hinge, which is attached with screws to the cockpit structure. The bottom of the cockpit door has an attachment fitting which engages with the floor structure. There is a cut-out section in the door structure for the door escape hatch. If an emergency occurs, the cockpit crew can get out of the cockpit through this door escape hatch. The door escape hatch structure is the same as the door. There are two pip-pin fittings installed on the inner side of the hatch. The two pip-pins engage with the related bracket of the door structure to keep the hatch in position. The manually operated three-latch mechanism keeps the cockpit door in the closed position. It is installed on the inner side of the cockpit door. It has a spring-loaded D-ring assembly which extends or retracts the three-latch tenons. The tenons engage with the catch of the electrical release strikes installed opposite in the lavatory wall. The cockpit door has a door handle and a spyglass. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 114 of 167 DESCRIPTION - DOOR Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 CATTS Ltd Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 115 of 167 COCKPIT DOOR D/O (3) DESCRIPTION (continued) CDLS For cockpit security, the cockpit door has an electro-mechanically operated release system: the CDLS. A keypad is installed adjacent to the Forward Attendant Panel (FAP). On the front face, there are two LEDs (red and green) and twelve P/BSWs with the legends 0 to 9, \"*\" and \"#\". A buzzer is installed in the cockpit ceiling panel. A signal from the control unit operates the buzzer for a minimum of 2 seconds. A toggle switch is installed on the cockpit door panel on the center pedestal. It is a three-position switch: UNLOCKed, NORMal and LOCKed. It is spring-loaded and returns automatically to the NORM position. This is the neutral position in which the closed cockpit door is automatically locked. An indication light is installed on the cockpit door panel. The indication is an OPEN legend and a FAULT legend. The OPEN legend comes on amber when the cockpit door is open. The FAULT legend also comes on amber when there is a malfunction in the CDLS. Three electrical release strikes are installed on the lavatory sidewall opposite the door latch mechanism. Each of the electrical release strikes has a micro switch activated by the latch when the solenoid is operated. Then the plunger extends and thus the catch cannot move, or the plunger retracts and thus the catch is free. The center electrical release strike has an additional micro switch that monitors the condition of the center latch mechanism. When its tenon does not engage with the catch, the OPEN indication light comes on. NOTE: If there is a total failure of the CDLS, the door can be closed manually from the cockpit side with a deadbolt to make sure that the A/C operates in MMEL conditions. The control unit is installed on the overhead panel. It has the legends CocKPiT DOOR CONTrol, STRIKE TOP, MIDdle and BOTtom and CHANnel 1 and CHAN 2. This unit manages the fault indications, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 CATTS Ltd time delays and door access control of the CDLS. To make sure that the CDLS operates in Minimum Equipment List (MEL) conditions, an optional second control unit can be installed on the overhead panel, as a back-up system. They have two internal pressure sensors that operate if a rapid decompression occurs in the flight compartment, which de-energizes the solenoids. The microprocessor receives signals from the toggle switch and the keypad. It sends a signal to operate the buzzer, the indication light, the green or red LED of the keypad and the solenoids of the electrical release strikes. If a fault occurs in the pressure sensors, the related CHAN 1 or CHAN 2 LED comes on and the amber FAULT light comes ON, on the cockpit door panel. If a fault occurs in the electrical release strikes, the related strike LED comes ON, the amber FAULT light comes ON, on the cockpit door panel, and the back-up control unit starts to operate in replacement. NOTE: If a rapid decompression occurs, the door is blown open by the flow of air through the A/C. If the first locking attempt is not satisfactory, the power is removed only from the related strike. After 2 seconds, the strike is activated again. If the second attempt is also not satisfactory, the strike is deactivated and the related fault LED comes ON, on the CDLCU. To reset a disabled strike, the toggle switch on the cockpit door panel must be set to the UNLOCK position and back to the NORM position. There is an additional counter that stops the strike for the entire Aircraft power cycle after ten unsatisfactory locking attempts. The counter is reset after a power cycle of the CDLS or after one satisfactory locking attempt. This makes sure that this counter has no effect on the daily operation and on the dispatchability of the aircraft. Pull the CDLS circuit breaker 1MQ in the cockpit to reset the system and the counter. The CKPT DOOR BacK UP panel is a back-up system which is activated through the LocKinG SYStem override switch, if one of these conditions occurs: Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 116 of 167 - FAULT indication comes ON on the basic system due to CHAN 1 and CHAN 2 fault, - basic system malfunction.

The buzzer then sounds, which tells the flight crew that access to the cockpit is requested. If the flight crew sets the toggle switch to the UNLOCK position: - the control unit de-energizes the solenoid of the release strikes. This causes the plungers to retract so that they do not block the catches, - the control unit sends a signal to the keypad so that the green LED comes on. This shows that the cockpit door is unlocked and that access is available, - the buzzer stops. Push the cockpit door in the flight direction until the magnetic stop keeps it in its fully open position. The amber OPEN indication light then comes ON on the cockpit door panel. This shows that the cockpit door is open. If the flight crew sets the toggle switch to the LOCK position: - the control unit does not de-energize the solenoids of the release strikes. The plungers therefore remain extended and block the catches, - the control unit sends a signal to the keypad so that the red LED comes on. This shows that the cockpit door is locked and that access to the cockpit is not available, - the buzzer stops. In this case, operation of the keypad and the buzzer is prevented during a specific time of between 5 and 15 min. The flight crew can cancel this function if they set the toggle switch from the LOCK position to the UNLOCK position. CABIN TO COCKPIT (EMERGENCY) Enter the selected four-digit code plus the \"#\" key on the keypad. This causes the buzzer to come on continuously and the green LED to flash. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500 CATTS Ltd If the flight crew does not operate the toggle switch within a specific time of between 15 seconds and 2 minutes: - the control unit de-energizes the solenoids of the release strikes. This causes the plungers to retract so they do not block the catches for 5 seconds, - the control unit sends a signal to the keypad. This causes the green LED to come on for 5 seconds. The green LED shows that the cockpit door is unlocked and access is possible, - the buzzer stops. Push the cockpit door in the flight direction until the magnetic stop keeps it in its fully open position. The amber OPEN indication light then comes ON on the cockpit door panel. This shows that the cockpit door is open. If the flight crew sets the toggle switch to the UNLOCK position within a specific time of between 15 seconds and 2 minutes: - the control unit de-energizes the solenoids of the release strikes. This causes the plungers to retract so that they do not block the catches, - the control unit sends a signal to the keypad so that the green LED comes on. The green LED shows that the cockpit door is unlocked and that access is possible, - the buzzer stops. Push the cockpit door in the flight direction until the magnetic stop keeps it in its fully open position. The amber OPEN indication light then comes ON on the cockpit door panel. This shows that the cockpit door is open. If the flight crew sets the toggle switch to the LOCK position within a specific time of between 15 seconds and 2 min: - the control unit does not de-energize the solenoid of the release strikes. So the plungers remain extended and block the catches, - the control unit sends a signal to the keypad so that its red LED comes on. This shows that the cockpit door is locked and access to the cockpit is not available, - the buzzer stops. Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 01/01/2025 119 of 167 In this case, operation of the keypad and the buzzer is prevented during a specific time of between 5 and 15 minutes. The flight crew can cancel this function if they set the toggle switch from the LOCK position to the UNLOCK position. BACK-UP SYSTEM (OPTIONAL) The cockpit door locking back-up system is an optional system activated under Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) conditions when the normal CDLS has failed. It ensures that the cockpit door release system can operate. The fault indication of one system is automatically inhibited when the other system is selected. If the optional back-up control unit is installed, an additional toggle switch lets you do the changeover to the back-up unit. This switch also lets you completely disconnect the system during maintenance.

A manual selection of the reverse is done when the flight crew lifts the latching levers on the throttle control levers. The reverse thrust command is sent to the ECU and the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The signal from the ECU to the directional valve is supplied to an inhibition relay controlled by the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) in relation to the position of the throttle control lever. In relation to commands from the ECU, a Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) supplies hydraulic power to operate the thrust reverser. The thrust reverser uses 4 hydraulically operated pivoting blocker doors to redirect the engine fan airflow.

If engine anti icing on the cockpit overhead panel is selected to ON, then hot bleed air from the engine is ducted to the cowl nose lip to prevent ice build-up. The air then exhausts overboard through a flush exit duct in the outer barrel. Longitudinal and transverse loads are distributed into the fan case forward flange through a bolted joint. These loads are due to: - the air intake structure own inertia as well as, - any internal or external loads not taken in hoop tension through the inner barrel skins. It incorporates a lightning protection system.

The forward sump is in the fan frame and is the location of bearings No.1, No.2 (fan/booster shaft) and No. 3 (High Pressure (HP) shaft). The aft sump is in the turbine rear frame where are bearings No.4 for the HP shaft aft and No.5 for the LP shaft. Bearings provide reduced rolling friction, support the rotors axially and radially within the engine structure, and position the rotors relative to the stators. The bearing must control the forces of gravity weight, aerodynamic loads of pumping and turbine driving and gyroscopic loads due to aircraft maneuvers. NO.1 AND NO.2 BEARING The No.1 ball bearing is a thrust bearing which carries the axial loads generated by the LP rotor system. The No.2 roller bearing takes the radial loads from the fan and booster rotor. NO.3 BEARING The inlet gearbox assembly contains a core engine thrust bearing, and a core engine roller bearing. NO.4 AND NO.5 BEARING The No.4 bearing, which takes the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) rotor radial loads, is a roller bearing installed between the HPT rear shaft and the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) shaft. The No.5 bearing supports the LPT rotor aft end inside the turbine frame and takes the radial loads.

Pressurization air is extracted from the primary airflow (booster discharge) and injected between the two labyrinth seals. The air, looking for the path with the least resistance, flows across the oil seal, thus preventing oil from escaping. Any oil that might cross the oil seal is collected in a cavity between the seals and routed to drain pipes. Once inside the oil sump cavity, the pressurization air becomes vented air and is directed to an air/oil rotating separator and then, out of the engine through the center vent tube, the rear extension duct and the flame arrestor.

The LPC is composed of: fan frame, fan booster rotor, and fan booster stator. The HPC section is divided into: HPC rotor, and HPC stator. FAN FRAME ASSEMBLY The fan frame module carries inlet cowl loads to support the fan, booster and HPC and their bearings, contains the forward mount and supports transfer and accessory gearboxes. It provides ducting for primary and secondary airflows and variable bleed valves. FAN BOOSTER ROTOR The fan rotor consists of one full diameter single stage fan for the secondary flow and a four-stage booster for the core engine flow. FAN BOOSTER STATOR Fixed stator vanes are installed for both, the fan and booster rotor. The casing is supported by the fan frame and supports the accessory drive gearbox.

The mechanical energy that the turbine provides to the compressor shaft is transmitted to the airflow with the compressor blades. In the stator the airflow is compressed progressively. Before entering the combustion chamber the last stator vanes, called Outlet Guide Vanes, must redirect the airflow. Due to the compression ratio the airflow tries to expand counter direction. If the compressor is incapable to compress the airflow, the compressor is surging. Stall is a local effect where the airflow is not compressed. Stall effects can bring the compressor to surge. To prevent the compressor surge the stall effects are controlled through the methods of airflow control. The Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) and the variable bleed valves are used to optimize stall margin.

The gases are mixed with the fuel from the spray nozzles. When the mixture encounters the burning zones, the combustion process starts. The combustion process finishes before entering the HPT nozzles. The flow is divided into the flow that goes through the combustion chamber and the flow that encircles it. The flow that enters the combustion chamber goes first through the dome in Single Annular Combustor engine and cools its surface. The flow that encircles the combustion chamber is mixed with the combusted gases entering the HPT nozzles to reduce the gas temperature at the turbine inlet and provide a film cooling to the first turbine nozzle.

The fuel coming from the A/C tanks through the LP valve is driven by the LP stage of the fuel pump. It is heated by the main oil/fuel heat exchanger, filtered, and then pressurized in the High Pressure (HP) stage of the fuel pump before entering the Hydromechanical Unit (HMU).

The fuel flows through the fuel flow transmitter, then through a fuel nozzle filter, then to the nozzles. OVERSPEED PROTECTION The overspeed governor system limits the core engine speed (N2) to a maximum of 106%, in the event of a malfunction that could drive the engine into an overspeed condition. The overspeed governor is hydro-mechanical (flyweights) and independent of the ECU. The Delta P valve is hydraulically forced to cause the by-passed valve to stroke more open. More fuel is by-passed, decreasing fuel flow to the FMV and, therefore, less fuel is available for combustion. TEST by ECU At each engine start, the micro-switch informs the ECU that the governor system is in operation. This micro-switch strokes open/close around 45% of N2.

FADEC also interfaces with aircraft signals. The FADEC system of each engine consists of a dual channel Electronic Control Unit (ECU), with its associated peripherals. The ECU is the computer of the FADEC system and is located on the engine fan case right hand side. Each ECU is powered by a three-phase permanent magnet alternator when the engine N2 > 58%. The FADEC Control Alternator provides an independent power supply to both ECU channels. FADEC FUNCTIONS The FADEC provides the regulation and scheduling of the engine systems to control the thrust and optimize engine operation. The FADEC system performs engine control functions and engine/A/C integration. The Engine control functions include: - Power management control, - Variable Bleed Valves (VBVs) control, - Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) control, - Transient Bleed Valve (TBV) control, - Fuel control regulation, - High Pressure Turbine Active Clearance Control (HPTACC), - Low Pressure Turbine Active Clearance Control (LPTACC), - Fuel Return Valve (FRV) control. Engine/A/C integration includes: - Engine indication, - Engine maintenance data, - Automatic and manual starting, - Thrust reverser control, - Autothrust, - Condition monitoring data.

Each channel can control the different components of the engine. Dual inputs, dual outputs, and automatic switch over from one channel to the other, eliminates any dormant failure. Channels A and B are permanently operational. But only the channel in control, called the Active Channel, delivers output commands. The other channel is called the Stand-by channel. The selection of the Active and the Stand-by Channel is done at ECU power-up and during operation. The ECU is equipped with a Built-in Test Equipment (BITE) system which provides maintenance information and test capabilities via the MCDU. DUAL INPUTS All control inputs to the FADEC system are dual. Only some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating are single. To increase the fault tolerant design, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels (inside the ECU) via the cross channel data link. Each channel can also operate independently, without cross channel data link. HARDWIRED INPUTS FAULT STRATEGY The ECU can detect and isolate failures using the BITE system. The BITE system allows each ECU channel to determine permanently its health status. The healthier channel is selected as the Active Channel. The other one is the Stand-by Channel. When both channels have the same health status, Active and Stand-by Channel selection alternates after every engine start. FAIL SAFE CONTROL If one channel is faulty, and the channel that is in control cannot ensure an engine component function, the component is moved to a fail-safe position. Example: if one channel is faulty and the other channel is unable to control the Variable Bleed Valve (VBV) position, the VBVs are set to the fail-safe open position. Most of the communication between the A/C systems and the ECU is transmitted over digital data buses. In addition, some signals are hardwired directly from the A/C to the ECU. DUAL OUTPUTS All of the ECU control outputs are dual. The channel that is in control supplies the control signals to the various components such as torque motors and solenoids. The other channel calculation is used for crosschecking.

The EIU is an interface concentrator that serves as the communication link, between the A/C systems and the FADEC system. There is one EIU for each engine. The ECU receives inputs from: - Air Data Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs), - Flight Control Unit (FCU), - Environmental Control System (ECS) computers, - Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), - Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs), - cockpit engine controls including fire, anti-ice systems and Throttle Lever Angle (TLA).

FADEC The FADEC includes the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and its peripheral components and sensors used for control and monitoring. The ECU interfaces with the other A/C systems through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The primary parameters (N1, N2, Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and Fuel Flow (FF)) are sent by the ECU to the ECAM through DMCs. Secondary parameters: - the oil quantity and oil pressure are sent to the DMCs by the SDACs. If there is a failure of the SDACs, the EIU sends data to the DMCs by the FWCs, - the oil temperature is sent by the EIU to the DMCs through the FWCs, - the vibration parameters are sent by the EVMU to the DMCs through the SDACs. ENGINE INTERFACE UNIT Each EIU, located in the avionics bay, is an interface concentrator between the airframe and the corresponding ECU located on the engine. There is one EIU for each engine. It interfaces with the corresponding ECU. POWER MANAGEMENT The FADEC provides automatic engine thrust control and thrust parameter limit computation. The FADEC manages power according to two thrust modes: - manual mode depending on Throttle Lever Angle (TLA), Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) - autothrust mode depending on autothrust function generated by the Auto Flight System (AFS). The FADEC also provides two idle mode selections: Minimum idle and approach idle. If the aircraft is on ground and extend the slats the engine will stay at minimum idle but in flight it will go to approach idle. The idle can also be modulated up to approach idle depending on: Air conditioning demand, wing anti-ice demand, engine anti-ice demand and oil temperature (for Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) cooling). ENGINE LIMIT PROTECTION The FADEC provides overspeed protection for N1 and N2, in order to prevent the engine from exceeding certified limits and also monitors the EGT. ENGINE SYSTEM CONTROL The FADEC provides optimal engine operation by controlling: - FF, - Turbine Clearance and Compressor Airflow. STARTING AND IGNITION CONTROL The FADEC controls the engine start sequence. It monitors N1, N2, and EGT parameters and can abort or recycle an engine start. The FADEC controls the starting and ignition in automatic mode when initiated from the ENG start panel (115 VU) or manual mode when initiated from the ENG MAN START panel. THRUST REVERSER The FADEC entirely supervises the thrust reverser operation. In case of malfunction, the thrust reverser is stowed.

Also note that the FADEC is repowered as soon as the engine start selector is selected to CRANK or IGNition START or the MASTER switch is selected ON. POWERING N2>58% As soon as the engine is running above 58% of N2, the Control Alternator supplies the ECU. The PMA supplies each channel with three-phase AC power. Two transformer rectifiers provide 28 VDC power supply to channels A and B. Above 58% of N2, the ECU logic automatically switches to the control alternator supply. In case of control alternator failure, the ECU will automatically switch over the 28VDC power supply from the aircraft network, available as a back-up through the EIU. AUTO DE-POWERING The FADEC is automatically de-powered on the ground, through the EIU, after engine shutdown.

It is comprised of two independent subsystems. Each subsystem includes: - a spark igniter, - a fan air cooled coaxial shielded ignition lead, - an ignition exciter. The pneumatic starting system drives the engine High Pressure (HP) rotor up to and above the engine self-sustaining speed for initial starting on ground or supports an engine re-light in flight if required. The start system is made of the pneumatic starter Shut-Off Valve (SOV) and the pneumatic starter. During a manual start, the pneumatic starter SOV opens when engine MANual START P/B is pressed in, then the ignition system is energized when the MASTER switch is set to the ON position. Note that also a manual start can be automatically aborted in case of EGT overlimit or compressor stall detection. Then the fuel is cut off and the engine will dry crank. CONTROL AND INDICATING CRANKING Engine motoring could be performed for dry cranking or wet cranking sequences. During cranking, ignition is inhibited. CONTINUOUS IGNITION The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) controls the ignition and starting systems either in automatic or manual mode. The operation of the pneumatic starter SOV and of the ignition system is displayed on the ECAM ENGINE page. With engine running, continuous ignition can be selected via the ECU either manually using the rotary selector or automatically by the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AUTOMATIC START During an automatic start, the ECU opens the pneumatic starter SOV, then one of the two ignition exciter is energized when the HP rotor reaches 16% of N2 speed. The ECU gives full protection during the start sequence. When the HP rotor has reached 50% of N2, the ECU closes the pneumatic starter SOV and cuts off ignition. In case of an incident during the automatic start the ECU aborts the start procedure. Safety precautions have to be taken prior to working in this area. WARNING: the ECU sends 115 volts to the ignition exciters, which converts it and sends high voltage, high-energy pulses through the ignition leads to the spark igniters. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES To increase aircraft dispatch reliability, the pneumatic starter SOV is equipped with a manual override. For this manual operation, the mechanic has to be aware of the engine safety zones.

In automatic mode the ECU is able, up to 50% N2, to abort the start sequence in case of an incident such as: - starter Shut-Off Valve (SOV) failure, - ignition failure, - High Pressure (HP) fuel SOV failure, - hot start, - hung start or, - engine stall. The system consists of a starter SOV, an air starter, two ignition exciters, spark igniters (A and B) and two ignition leads. The starter SOV is fitted with a manual override handle for manual operation in case of electrical SOV failure. On the enhanced system, the same information is provided with a different display presentation.

The aircraft configuration in this case is the following: - APU running and APU BLEED on, - Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) 1 and 2 powered. When IGNition START is selected the ENGINE page is called automatically. During engine start, the ENGINE page includes IGN indication, starter SOV position and bleed pressure. During this time the pack valves are automatically closed. If, after 30 seconds, the ENGine MASTER control switch is not switched to ON position, the pack valves will re-open. As soon as the ENGine MASTER control switch is set to ON position, the Low Pressure (LP) fuel SOV opens and the ECU opens the starter SOV. The position of this valve is confirmed on the ECAM and the N2 begins to increase. When N2 reaches 16% the ECU provides ignition. The selection of the spark igniter is a function of the ECU and at each start the igniter selection will be changed. At 16% of N2, on the ENGINE page, the corresponding spark igniter system (A or B) chosen by the ECU is displayed. When N2 reaches 22% the ECU controls, through the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV), HP fuel SOV opening. At this percentage of N2, fuel flow begins. The ECU monitors the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and N2 according to their schedules to provide the correct fuel flow. The maximum EGT during start sequence is 725\u00ba C. In case of malfunction the ECU automatically shuts down the engine and performs a dry motoring sequence. Up to 50% N2, the automatic fuel flow regulation is performed. At 50% N2, the ECU closes the starter SOV and cuts off the ignition. The pack valves re-open if another engine is not started within 30 seconds. Engine 2 is now stabilized at minimum idle. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) To start the second engine, you set the MASTER control switch 1 to ON keeping the selector in the IGNition START position. To complete this start sequence the selector is set back to MODE NORMal position. With the selector in this position and at least one engine running, the WHEEL page appears instead of the ENGINE page. If IGNition START is re-selected, continuous ignition is initiated on the running engines. At any time, if the MASTER lever is set to OFF, the start sequence or the engine operation is stopped because the MASTER control switch directly energizes the HP fuel SOV solenoid. With the MASTER control switch at OFF, the LP and HP SOVs are closed. With both engines shut down, the DOOR/OXYgen page is displayed.

During start the ENGINE page displays IGN indication, starter SOV position and bleed pressure. During this time the pack valves are automatically closed. If, after 30 seconds, the ENGine MANual START P/B is not switched ON, the pack valves will re-open. Selecting the ENGine MANual START P/B opens the starter SOV. After that, the N2 begins to increase and, when it is at least 20% N2, the MASTER control switch must be set to the ON position. Before the MASTER control switch is set to ON, it is possible to interrupt the sequence by selecting the MANual START P/B switch to OFF. As soon as the MASTER control switch is set to the ON position, both ignition systems are energized, LP and HP SOV are opened and fuel flow increases. At 20% of N2 with the MASTER control switch at ON, dual ignition and fuel flow are initiated. The ECU monitors the EGT and N2, according to their schedules, to provide the correct fuel flow. The maximum EGT during start sequence is 725\u00ba C. In case of malfunction, set the MASTER control switch to OFF to perform a start abort sequence. In manual starts there is no automatic shutdown function. Up to 50% of N2, the automatic fuel flow regulation is performed. When N2 reaches 50%, the ECU automatically closes the starter SOV and cuts off the ignition. The pack valves re-open after 30 seconds. Engine 2 is now stabilized at minimum idle. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) To start the other engine, set the ENGine 1 MANual START P/B to ON, keeping the selector in the IGNition START position and then, when N2 reaches 20%, set the MASTER control switch 1 to ON. After engine start, the selector is set back to MODE NORMal position. With the selector in this position and one engine running, the WHEEL page appears instead of the ENGINE page. If IGNition START is re-selected, continuous ignition is initiated on the running engine(s). To complete the start sequence, the MANual START P/B is released out. The action on the MANual START P/B has no effect on the starter SOV which has already been automatically closed at 50% of N2, it is only done to complete the manual start procedure.

Both systems are fuel operated by the HydroMechanical Unit (HMU) and controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). VARIABLE BLEED VALVE SYSTEM The VBV system controls the airflow from the fan and the booster to the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) by using 12 valves. By dumping excessive air into the fan air stream, the VBVs increase the booster mass flow and improve the booster and the HPC matching at low speed and transient operations. VARIABLE STATOR VANE SYSTEM The VSV system controls the primary airflow through the HPC by varying the angle of the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) and three stages of variable vanes. The VSVs give aerodynamic matching of the LP stages of compression with the HP stages to prevent engine surge.

To eliminate the risk of booster stall during low power conditions, the VBV system by-passes air from the primary airflow into the secondary airflow. It is installed within the fan frame mid-box structure and is composed of: -A fuel gear motor -A stop mechanism -A master bleed valve -Eleven variable bleed valves -Flexible shafts -A feedback sensor (RVDT) The ECU calculates the VBV position and the HMU gives the necessary fuel pressure to drive a fuel gear motor, through a dedicated servo valve.

The fuel flow sent to the gear motor is constantly controlled by the ECU, via the torque motor and servo valve in the HMU. STOP MECHANISM The stop mechanism limits the number of revolutions of the gear motor to the exact number, required for a complete cycle (open and close) of the VBV system. The stop mechanism is located in between the gear motor and the master ball screw actuator. MASTER BLEED VALVE and FEEDBACK SENSOR The master bleed valve and ballscrew actuator assembly is a unit, which transmits the driving input from the gear motor to the 11 remaining variable bleed valves (VBV's). A lever, integral with a hinged door, is connected to a feedback rod, which transmits the angular position of the door to an RVDT. This sensor gives the position feedback to the ECU. It has two marks, which should be aligned when the system is adjusted to the fully closed position. The adjustment is done through the feedback rod in between the master bleed valve and the RVDT. VARIABLE BLEED VALVES (VBV's) The master bleed valve drives the 11 variable bleeds valves (VBVs) through a series of flexible shafts. The flexible shafts make sure that the VBVs remain fully synchronized throughout their complete operation.

It also improves the stall margin during transient engine operations. The VSV position is calculated by the ECU using various engine parameters, and the necessary fuel pressure is delivered by the HMU dedicated servo valve. The VSV system is located at the front of the HP compressor. The VSV system is composed of: A series of actuators and bellcrank assemblies Two hydraulic actuators Two feedback sensors (in actuators) Two bellcrank assemblies Four actuation rings Variable stator stages (inside HPC case) Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 228 of 407 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY VSV SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 229 of 407 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY AIR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) VSV SYSTEM OPERATION The VSV system positions the compressor VSVs to the angles necessary to give the optimum compressor efficiency and stall margin for transient engine operation. Stator vane angle is a function of core engine speed (N2) and altitude. The VSV actuator drives the VSV linkage assembly to the stator angle calculated by the ECU, through the HMU. The torque motor supplies fuel to the actuator to close or open the vanes or hold their position by pressure balancing the actuator piston. The LVDT transmits a feedback signal of actual vane position to the ECU for comparison to scheduled position.

The clearance between the blade tips and the casings is actively controlled in order to optimize engine performance using cooling air to shrink the LP and HP turbine casings. HIGH PRESSURE TURBINE ACTIVE CLEARANCE CONTROL The High Pressure Turbine Active Clearance Control (HPTACC) system uses stage 4 and stage 9 HPC air to heat or cool the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) shroud support structure. The ECU monitors the shroud support structure temperature using the T case sensor. LOW PRESSURE ACTIVE CLEARANCE CONTROL SYSTEM The Low Pressure Turbine Active Clearance Control (LPTACC) system uses fan air for external case cooling of the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT). SYSTEM TRANSIENT BLEED VALVE SYSTEM The Transient Bleed Valve (TBV) improves the compressor stall margin during transient and start conditions. The TBV unloads the HPC by discharging stage 9 HPC air in the LPT cavity.

It also protects the turbine case from over-temperature by monitoring the EGT. This ensures the best performance of the LPT at all engine ratings. The LPTCC system is a closed loop system, which regulates the cooling airflow sent to the LPT case, through a valve and a manifold. A dual RVDT sensor is installed at one end of the butterfly valve shaft and supplies the feedback signal to the ECU.

Using engine input parameters, the ECU logic calculates when to open or close the TBV to duct HPC 9th stage bleed air, in order to give optimum stability for transient mode operations. The 9th stage bleed air is ducted to the LPT stage 1 nozzle, providing an efficient start stall margin. The ECU, working through the HMU, controls the TBV position. The TBV system consists of: - The TBV, located on the HPC case, between the 7 and 8 o'clock positions. - The 9th stage air IN and OUT pipes. The valve position is monitored by the ECU, through a dual channel LVDT. The LVDT supplies the feedback signal, which agrees with the butterfly position.

TLA (Reverser Full Throttle stop) to +45 deg. TLA: o -20 degrees TLA corresponds to Reverser Full Throttle stop o +45 degrees TLA corresponds to Forward Full Throttle stop An intermediate mechanical stop is set to 0 deg.TLA. This stop is overridden when the reverse latching lever is pulled up for selection of the reverse power. This stop is reset as soon as the throttle control lever is selected back to forward thrust area. In the forward thrust area, there are two detent points, the MAX CLIMB detent point set to 25 deg.TLA and the MAX CONTINUOUS/FLEX TAKE-OFF detent point set to 35 deg.TLA. In the reverse thrust throttle range, there is one detent point at - 6 deg.TLA. This position agrees with the selection of the thrust reverser command and the Reverse Idle setting. In the middle throttle range (0deg. To 35 deg.TLA), the autothrust function can be active if engaged. This range agrees with the selection of MAX CLIMB or MAX CONTINUOUS thrust limit mode (in single operation). If the autothrust is not engaged, the engine control is manual.

Each sector drives itself a set of one resolver and three potentiometers. The relationship between the throttle lever angle and throttle resolver angle (TRA) IS LINEAR AND 1 DEG.TLA = 1.9 TRA. The accuracy of the throttle control unit (error between the input lever position and the resolver angle) is 0.5 deg.TRA. The maximum discrepancy between the signals generated by two resolvers is 0.25 deg.TRA. The TLA resolver operates in two quadrants. The first quadrant is used for positive angles and the second quadrant for negative angles. Each resolver is dedicated to one FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) and receives its electrical excitation current (6 VAC) from the related FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) The ECU considers a throttle resolver angle value: o less than -47.5 deg.TRA or o greater than 98.8 deg.TRA as resolver position signal failure. The ECU includes a resolver fault accommodation logic. This logic allows engine operation after a failure or a complete loss of the throttle resolver position signal.

The No. 1 bearing vibration sensor permanently monitors the vibrations from No. 1 bearing and the vibrations from LPT and High Pressure Turbine (HPT) shafts. It's also used to the fan trim balance procedure. The Turbine Rear Frame (TRF) vibration sensor is installed at 12 o'clock on the front flange of the TRF. The TRF vibration sensor is used as back-up of N1 bearing accelerometer to monitor and, if necessary, reduce the engine vibration level using the trim balance procedure. The aircraft EVMU uses the vibration and the rotational speed signals to extract all the vibration signals and compute the position and the amplitude of the unbalanced signals. As normal vibration is depending on rotor speed, for each speed, the EVMU processes the ratio actual value/maxi value. This ratio is multiplied by 10 and is available on the EVMU output for display on ECAM SD.

Then, the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) permits reverser deployment by energization of the inhibition relay, so the directional valve can be opened by the ECU. To command the thrust reverser, the ECU needs an \"A/C on ground\" signal supplied by the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs). REVERSER DESIGN The thrust reverser system is of the aerodynamic blockage type. It consists of 4 pivoting blocker doors which stop and redirect fan discharge airflow. Two doors are installed on each \"C\" duct. Thrust reverser operation is possible on ground only. HYDRAULIC SUPPLY The thrust reverser system is hydraulically supplied by the corresponding hydraulic pump on the engine. The thrust reverser is isolated from the hydraulic supply by a Shut Off Valve. ACTUATION Each door is operated by a hydraulic actuator. The actuators receive fluid from the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) which is controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Two independent latch mechanisms maintain each pivoting blocker door in the stowed position, one inside the actuator and the second with the door latch. The door latches are hydraulically released in series at the beginning of the deploy sequence. REVERSER CONTROL Basically the thrust reverser system is controlled through the ECU from the two reverser latching levers located on the throttle control levers. The HCU has a pressurizing valve and a directional valve to select deploy or stow mode. The directional valve is operated to deploy only. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) REVERSER INDICATING The actual state of the thrust reverser is shown on the ECAM warning display (REVerser indication in the middle of N1 dial). The signals come from the stow and deploy position switches. Reverse thrust is allowed when reversers are deployed. MAINTENANCE PRACTICE To help trouble shooting, a reverser test can be performed through the MCDU. For maintenance purposes or to increase A/C dispatch, the HCU is fitted with a deactivation lever to deactivate the thrust reverser system. For the lock-out procedure, four lock-out bolts should also be installed. WARNING: The thrust reverser system should be deactivated using the HCU lever, before working on the system or on the engine. If not, the thrust reverser can accidentally operate and cause serious injuries to personnel and/or damage to the reverser.

THRUST REVERSER ACTUATION The hydraulic power required for the actuators is supplied by the normal A/C hydraulic system: - Green system for engine 1, - Yellow system for engine 2. A Shut-Off Valve (SOV) located upstream of the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) provides an independently controlled locking system. Each channel of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) controls and monitors solenoid valves in the HCU. The HCU provides hydraulic pressure for unlocking, deploying, stowing and locking of the actuators and latches of the pivoting doors. The HCU includes a pressurizing valve, a pressure switch and a directional valve which is controlled through the inhibition relay. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 301 of 407 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL & THRUST REVERSER ACTUATION Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 302 of 407 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY THRUST REVERSER MANAGEMENT (3) THRUST REVERSER CONTROL THRUST REVERSER INDICATION When the reverse thrust is selected in the cockpit, the following sequence occurs: - when the potentiometers detect a Throttle Lever Angle (TLA) lower than -3\u00ba, the SOV opens if the altitude is less than 6 feet and if high forward thrust is not selected on the opposite engine. Then the HCU is supplied hydraulically. The SOV is controlled open by the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) through the static and power relays. - when the switch of the throttle control unit detects a TLA \\< -3.8\u00ba, the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) energizes the inhibition relay. The ECU energizes the pressurizing valve solenoid in the HCU. A Pressure Switch in the HCU gives a feedback signal to the ECU. The four actuators are initially pressurized on the rod side of the pistons keeping the doors in the stowed position. - When the A/C is on ground with engines running (N2 condition) and the resolvers detect a TLA \\< -4.3\u00ba, the ECU controls the thrust reverser operation through the HCU. The ECU energizes the solenoid of the directional valve. The four hydraulic latches at the pivoting door open sequentially. Only when all four latches are open the hydraulic pressure pushes on the head side of the hydraulic actuators. The pivoting doors open. When reverse thrust operation is no longer selected from the cockpit the ECU controls the pivoting doors to move to the stow position by energizing the pressurizing valve solenoid while the directional valve solenoid remains de-energized. The stow and deploy switches are used to monitor the pivoting door position and for ECU control. The thrust reverser operating sequences are displayed in the cockpit on the EWD. An amber REV indication comes on on the N1 indicator when the doors are in transit. It becomes green when the doors are deployed. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) NOTE: If there is a mechanical inhibition of the thrust reverser (for dispatch), a caution \"ENG X REV INHIBITED\" is displayed on the ECAM to tell the crew that the thrust reverser is inoperative.

It lubricates and cools the bearings of the forward and aft sumps. It also lubricates and cools bearings and gears in the transfer and accessory gearboxes. The oil system is a \"dry sump\" full flow system. A single pressure pump and four scavenge pumps of gerotor type are located in a single lubrication unit. The major components of the oil system are the oil tank, the lubrication unit, the servo fuel heater and the main oil/fuel heat exchanger. The detectors and sensors shown on the schematic give indicating and monitoring.

The supply pump pressure is not controlled, but the oil output flow is, by design, always greater than the lubrication requirements. A pressure relief valve bypasses part of the output flow to protect the supply pump against abnormal output pressure build-up. If the main filter becomes clogged, a clog switch sends a signal to the ECAM, a bypass valve opens and the oil flows through the backup filter. The oil flows to the forward and aft sumps, and to the accessory and transfer gearboxes. The anti-siphon device prevents oil from draining by gravity from the tank through the pump into the gearbox after engine shutdown. It uses air from the forward sump.

The lubrication unit supplies oil under the required pressure for lubrication of the engine bearings and gears, for scavenge of the oil after lubrication and when the oil goes back to the tank. But, before the oil goes back to the tank, the scavenged oil from the engine sumps circulates, successively, through: - The 4 scavenge screens (in the lubrication unit housing) which give a first and coarse filtration of the oil scavenged from the AGB, the engine forward bearing sump, the TGB and the engine aft bearing sump, - The master magnetic chip detector (on the lubrication unit) through which circulates the total scavenged oil flow. The lubrication unit is installed on the right-hand side of the AGB front face. The lubrication unit has a single housing containing the following items: - Five positive displacement pumps (one oil supply and 4 scavenge pumps), - One oil temperature sensor, - One clogging indicator transmitter (oil filter differential pressure switch) which sends to the cockpit a warning about main oil filter clogging, if this occurs during engine operation, - One bypass valve for the main oil supply filter, - One master magnetic chip detector (MCD) to detect the contamination of the engine oil system by magnetic chips/particles and connected to a master chip detector indicator.

For troubleshooting and leak isolation a drain collector is installed on the accessory gearbox. The drain collector supplies the drain manifold module, which supports the drain mast. The drain mast also has separate drains for additional leak isolation. The pylon drain tubes collect fluids from individual pylon chambers, also for leak isolation. If fluid leaks are found during transit operations, the AMM (ATA 70-00 & ATA 29-00) lists maximum permitted leakage limits for the drain system. There are limits for STATIC (engine not running) and DYNAMIC (engine running) conditions. Here are some examples of leakage limits for dispatch. See the AMM for complete list. NOTE: In the case of extreme cold weather condition (Outside Air Temperature (OAT) \\<- 20 deg.C (- 4 deg.F), fuel leaks from the drain mast may occur on a non-running engine and during engine start. This leakage is expected to stop after a 5 minute warm-up at minimum idle.

The speed of the LP rotor is indicated on ECAM as N1. The fan assembly has 22 wide-chord blades and supplies most of the engine thrust. The air produced by the fan is known as secondary airflow or bypass airflow. The intermediate case is the main structural support for the front of the engine. To protect the fuselage in case of a fan failure, it is designed to contain any broken blades. The 4-stage booster compressor is enclosed in the intermediate case. The booster supplies air to the engine core. This is primary airflow. The LP rotor (N1) is made of the fan and the booster compressor driven by the LP turbine. Open the cowls to gain access to the forward engine mount. The five-stage LP Turbine extracts energy from the gas stream delivered from the HP Turbine in order to drive the booster compressor and the fan. Exhaust gas from the LP turbine goes through a nozzle to supply propulsive thrust. The LP rotor is supported by roller and ball bearings, which are lubricated and cooled. The turbine exhaust case is the main structural support for the rear of the engine. The AFT mount is attached to the top of the turbine exhaust case.

Each engine is controlled by an EEC. The EEC is a dual channel computer. The EEC controls the engine during start and all operations. The EEC manages engine thrust and protects against overspeed and overtemperature by controlling the engine sub-systems. The EEC also monitors all engine subsystems and sensors for failure. When the engine is running, power for FADEC operation is fulfilled by a dual-output FADEC alternator driven by the gearbox. The FADEC system has the dual channel EEC and the following peripherals: - Fuel Metering Unit (FMU), - Dedicated FADEC alternator, - Compressor control systems, - Clearance control systems, - Start system (starter shutoff valve, ignition exciters), - Thrust reverser system, - Heat management system, - Engine sensors, - Electrical harnesses.

Essential communication with the EEC (thrust lever position, air data, etc.) is direct from the applicable systems and controls. Non-essential communication (autothrust, Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS), etc.) is routed through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) of each engine. The EIUs interface with various aircraft circuits and systems. The data is then transmitted in a single stream to each EEC channel. Engine vibration monitoring is accomplished by the Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU). The EVMU collects vibration data from both engines. The vibration information is displayed on the ECAM and is also available through the CFDS for troubleshooting.

Reverse is manually selected by the flight crew by lifting the latching levers on the throttle control levers. The reverse thrust command is sent to the EEC and the EIU. The DEPLOY command from the EEC is routed through the EIU as a second level of protection against inadvertent deployment. According to commands from the EEC and the EIU, a Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) supplies hydraulic power to operate the thrust reverser. The thrust reverser assembly has 2 hydraulically actuated translating sleeves. The translating sleeves are each powered by 2 actuators. As the translating sleeve moves aft during deployment, it raises blocker doors to redirect the engine fan airflow. Reverse thrust is only available on the ground.

CONTROL PANELS The engines are controlled by throttle control levers, on the center pedestal. They can only be moved manually. For reverse thrust operation, two latching levers let the throttle control levers move rearward into the reverse thrust section. The A320 family aircraft normally operate in autothrust mode in flight. The autothrust can be disconnected with the two red buttons known as instinctive disconnect pushbuttons (2 red buttons on the outside of each throttle control lever). This lets the engines be controlled in manual thrust mode. The controls for engine starting and shutdown are on the center pedestal immediately behind the throttle control levers. The engine MAN START switches are used to start an engine during a manual start procedure. They are also used during a dry or wet motoring procedure. The N1 MODE switches are used to change the engine control mode from Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) to N1 control if an EPR failure occurs.

This will prevent injury to persons and/or damage to aircraft. Here is an overview of main safety precautions related to the engines. Make sure that all engine danger areas are as clear as possible to prevent damage to the engine, to the aircraft or to persons in the area. Be careful: The entry corridor will be closed when the engine power is above the minimum. Make sure that you have fire-fighting equipment available. Do not try to stop the fan from turning by hand. After engine shutdown, let the oil tank pressure bleed off a minimum of 5 minutes before you remove the tank filler cap. If you do not, pressurized oil can flow out of the tank and cause dangerous burns. The engine ignition system is an electrical system with high energy. You must be careful to prevent electrical shock. Injury or death can occur. Do not do maintenance on the ignition system while the engine operates. Make sure that the engine shutdown occurred more than 5 minutes ago before you continue with the maintenance procedure. Make sure that the thrust reverser is deactivated during maintenance. If not, the thrust reverser can operate accidentally and cause injury to personnel and/or damage to the reverser. When opening the engine cowls: - Respect the wind limitations and the opening/closing sequence, - Always secure cowls with the hold-open rods, - Make sure that the slats are retracted and install a warning notice to prevent slat operation.

LPC FAN MODULE ASSEMBLY The LPC (fan) module is a rotor assembly, which includes twenty-two blades and a disk. Rotation of the rotor causes air to be ingested into the front of the engine and compressed. A large proportion of the compressed air is delivered through the fan discharge duct to the exhaust nozzle to supply the majority of engine thrust. The remainder of the compressed air goes into the booster section for further compression by the booster. LPC INTERMEDIATE CASE MODULE The LPC intermediate case module includes a four stages axial flow booster section, a fan case section and an internal gearbox and drive section. The fan case section of LPC/intermediate case module makes the outer annulus of the cold stream duct. HPC The HPC is a ten stages axial flow module.

Compressed air is then divided into two separate airflows: - a large portion is delivered to the exhaust nozzle, - the remainder is compressed in the booster before being compressed again by the HPC. The fan outlet inner vane assembly, compressor stage 1.5, 2, 2.3 and 2.5 assemblies and compressor stage 2.5 vanes compress the air progressively. Then the air is delivered at a suitable pressure to the HPC. Then the HPC accepts air from the LPC and booster system, further compress it, and direct the air to the diffuser/combustion. LPC bleed valve and actuating mechanism are incorporated into the bleed air system The modulated bleed makes sure that the booster has an adequate surge margin under all operating conditions. Due to the compression ratio that supports each stage, the airflow tries to expand in counter direction. If the entire compressor is not capable to compress the airflow. Stall is a local effect where the airflow is not compressed. Stall effects can bring the compressor to surge. To prevent the compressor surge the stall effects are controlled through the methods of airflow control.

The FDV receives metered fuel through a fuel line from the FMU. The fuel goes through a 200-micron strainer and then into ten internal discharge ports. If the strainer gets blocked, a bypass valve will open. The ten discharge ports are connected to the ten fuel manifolds, each of which in turn supplies two nozzles (20 nozzles at all). At an engine shutdown, eight of the ten internal discharge ports in the valve are connected due to the fact, that there is no more fuel coming from the FMU and the drain valve in the FDV is spring-loaded in the closed position. This lets remaining fuel from the upper eight fuel manifolds to be drained into the engine through the two lowest fuel manifolds and their related nozzles. The two fuel manifolds, which remain full, help to supply fuel for the next engine start.

The EEC acts on the heat management system through the Fuel Diverter and Return to tank Valve (FDRV) and the ACOC modulating valve. NOTE: Note: The 4 modes of operation are modes 1, 3, 4 and 5: - modes 1 and 4 are return to tank modes, - modes 3 and 5 are no return to tank modes. ACOC MODULATING VALVE Oil heated by the engine passes through the ACOC and then to the fuel cooled oil cooler. The ACOC modulating valve regulates a bleed part of fan airflow crossing the ACOC to maintain both oil and fuel temperatures within acceptable minimum and maximum limits. FUEL DIVERTER AND RETURN TO TANK VALVE (FDRV) The fuel diverter valve and the return to tank valve are enclosed in the same housing. The FDRV maintain fuel, engine oil and IDG oil temperatures within limits by minimizing ACOC cooling air usage. The two-position diverter valve works by managing the fuel recirculation inside the engine fuel system. The return to tank valve will divert a modulated proportion of the LP fuel back to the aircraft tanks. CONTROL The EEC controls the heat management system through 4 modes of operation taking into account 3 parameters of temperature: - engine fuel, - engine oil, - IDG oil. The temperature of the aircraft fuel tanks and the engine power setting are parameters used for inhibition of fuel return to aircraft tanks.

PURPOSE The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system provides full range engine control throughout all flight and operational phases. It consists of a dual channel Electronic Engine Control (EEC) and its peripheral components and sensors. FADEC FUNCTIONS The FADEC provides the engine system regulation and scheduling to control the thrust and optimize the engine operation. The FADEC provides: - power setting with EPR or N1 back-up mode, - P2/T2 heating, - acceleration and deceleration times, - idle speed governing, - overspeed limits for N1 and N2, - Fuel Flow (FF) control, - Variable Stator Vane system (VSV) control, - compressor handling bleed valves control, - booster stage bleed valve system control, - High Pressure (HP)/Low Pressure (LP) turbine Active Clearance Control (ACC), - automatic and manual engine starting, - thrust reverser control, - oil and fuel temperature management through the heat management system. POWER SUPPLY The FADEC system is self-powered by a dedicated Permanent Magnet Alternator (PMA) when N2 is greater than 10%. The EEC is powered by the aircraft 28 VDC electrical network for starting, as a backup and for testing with the engine not running. 115 VAC is used for the power supply of the ignition system and the P2/T2 probe heating. The PMA also provides the EEC Channel A and Channel B with the N2 rotation speed. FADEC BENEFITS The application of a FADEC system provides multiple benefits: - it saves weight and fuel by a full range control of the gas generator, - it reduces pilot workload and maintenance cost, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 157 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY PURPOSE ...

Dual inputs, dual outputs and automatic switchover from one channel to the other eliminate any dormant failure. The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) consists of two channels A and B. Each channel can control the different components of the engine systems. Channels A and B are permanently operational. The channel in control manages the system. The EEC is equipped with a BITE system which provides maintenance information and test capabilities via the MCDU. DUAL INPUTS All control inputs to the FADEC system are doubled. Only some secondary parameters used for monitoring and indicating are single. To increase the fault tolerant design, the parameters are exchanged between the two control channels inside the EEC via the cross channel data link. HARDWIRED INPUTS Most of the information exchanged between the A/C and the EEC is transmitted over digital data buses, some signals over a single line. In addition, some signals are hard-wired directly from the A/C to the EEC. The Throttle Lever Angle (TLA) is transformed by resolvers into a Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA) and transmitted directly to the EEC. 1\u00b0 of TLA corresponds to 1.9\u00b0 of TRA. DUAL OUTPUTS All the EEC outputs are double, but only the channel in control supplies the engine control signals to the various receptors such as torque motors and solenoids. The other channel calculation is used for crosschecking. FAULT STRATEGY Using the BITE system, the EEC can detect and isolate failures. It also allows the EEC to switch engine control from the faulty channel to the healthy one. Depending on the nature of the failure, the EEC will behave differently in case of: - single input signal failure, there is no channel changeover, the channel in control uses the inputs from the other channel through the cross channel data link, - dual input signal failure, the system runs on synthesized values of the healthiest channel, - single output signal failure, there is an automatic switchover to the standby active channel, - complete output signal failure, there is no longer any current to drive the torque motors or solenoids, the related component will go to the \"fail-safe\" position. FAIL-SAFE CONTROL If a channel is faulty and the channel in control is unable to ensure one engine function, this control is moved to a fail-safe position. Example: if the channel is faulty and the remaining channel in control is unable to control the Variable Stator Vane (VSV) position, the vanes are set to the fail-safe open position. MAIN INTERFACES To perform all its tasks, the EEC interfaces with A/C computers, either directly or via the Engine Interface Unit (EIU), which is an interface Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 159 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY concentrator between the A/C systems and the FADEC system.

FADEC The FADEC consists of the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) and its peripheral components and sensors used for control and monitoring. The EEC is in relation with the other A/C systems through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The primary parameters Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR), Low Pressure Rotor Speed (N1), High Pressure Rotor Speed (N2), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), and Fuel Flow (FF) are sent directly by the EEC to the ECAM. Secondary parameters: - the oil quantity and oil pressure are sent to the DMCs by the SDACs. In case of SDACs failure, the EIU sends data to DMCs by the FWCs, - the oil temperature is sent by the EIU to DMCs via thhe FWCs, - the fuel used data is directly sent to DMCs via the EEC, - the vibration parameters are sent by the EIVMU to DMCs via the SDACs. EIU Each EIU, located in the avionics bay, is an interface concentrator between the airframe and the corresponding FADEC located on the engine. There is one EIU for each engine. POWER MANAGEMENT The FADEC provides automatic engine thrust control and thrust parameter limit computation. The thrust is computed according to the Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) in normal mode or N1 in back-up mode. In fact, when the Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) mode is no longer operational the Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) FADEC automatically reverts to the N1 alternate control mode. The FADEC manages power according to two thrust modes: - manual mode depending on the Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA), - auto thrust mode depending on the auto thrust function generated by the Auto Flight System (AFS). The FADEC also provides two idle mode selections: - approach idle, - minimum idle. Approach idle is obtained when the slats are extended. Minimum idle can be modulated up to approach idle depending on air conditioning, engine anti-ice and wing anti-ice demands. ENGINE LIMITS The FADEC provides overspeed protection for N1 and N2, in order to prevent the engine from exceeding limits, and also monitors the EGT and Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR). ENGINE SYSTEMS The FADEC provides optimal engine operation by controlling the: - FF, - compressor airflow and turbine clearance. IGNITION AND STARTING The FADEC controls the engine start sequence. It monitors N1, N2, and EGT parameters and can abort or recycle an engine start. The FADEC controls the ignition and starting in automatic or manual mode when initiated from the ENGine start or ENGine MANual START panels. THRUST REVERSER The FADEC supervises the thrust reverser operation entirely.

THRUST REVERSER Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 164 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY EEC INTERFACES (3) GENERAL In order to provide a full range of engine control and monitoring, the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) interfaces with the following sub systems: - air data computers, which transmit air data for engine control, - Engine Interface Unit (EIU), which concentrates A/C signals and transmits them to the EEC, - for cockpit indication and control, and autothrust control, the EEC sends signals to computers, - engine sensors and controls. DIGITAL INPUTS - engine control parameters, - engine condition monitoring parameters, - EEC status and fault indication, - engine rating parameters, - Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system maintenance data. The EEC transmits outputs continuously on all buses in normal operation, irrespective of whether the given channel is in active control or not. The parameter values on the 2 output buses are normally identical as long as the cross channel data link is functioning. NOTE: Channel switchover does not affect the output data of the EEC. DISCRETE/ANALOG SIGNALS Inputs of each channel are isolated in order to prevent failure propagation. Each channel receives inputs for both the Air Data/Inertial Reference Units (ADIRUs) and the EIU. The EEC performs a fault detection on its input parameters by determining if they are valid. This check is made by applying a range of tests to each input. Faults detected by the EEC are annunciated and recorded for maintenance or crew action, if required. The ADIRUs send air data parameters to the EEC for engine control. The EEC performs validation tests and selection logic between air data signals from the ADIRUs and the engine sensors. ADIRU data is preferred over engine data. The air data used to validate Altitude (P0), Total Air Temperature (TAT), TOTal PRESSure, mach for the power management and engine controls are: - TAT, TOTal PRESSure, P0, mach number, from the ADIRUs, - P2, T2 and P0 from engine sensors. The EEC receives the Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA) signals, the autothrust instinctive disconnect switch signals and engine sensor signals. They are validated by the EEC. The EEC also sends signals to the engine controls. The resolvers of the Throttle Control Unit (TCU) receive an excitation current from the EEC. The EEC checks the range limits, the rate limits and performs an interface fault detection test. NOTE: 1 degree TLA corresponds to 1.9 degree TRA. DIGITAL OUTPUTS Each channel has 2 output ports and each bus has a separated line driver, i.e. A1, A2, B1, B2, in such a way that propagation of failures is prevented. The EEC output buses provide: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 165 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL ...

Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 167 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY BLOCK DIAGRAM Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 168 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY EIU INTERFACES (3) GENERAL There are 2 Engine Interface Units (EIUs), one for each engine. The EIU is an interface concentrator between the A/C and the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The main functions of the EIU are: - to concentrate data from the cockpit panels, - to ensure the segregation of the 2 engines, - to provide the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) with an electrical power supply, - to give the necessary logic and information from the engine to the aircraft systems. EIU COMPOSITION The EIU is composed of 5 main parts: - discrete and analog inputs, - digital inputs, - digital outputs, - discrete outputs, - power supply switching. EIU FUNCTIONS The EIU performs the following: - acquisition of information, - transmission of messages, - logics for Low Oil Pressure (LOP) and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) boost, - fault detection logic carried out by an internal BITE and transmission of the result to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). INPUTS The EIU receives the following: - discrete signals which are of the ground/open circuit type, Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) - analog inputs which are of the differential type with a working range of 1 to 9 volts, - digital inputs on ARINC 429 lines. OUTPUTS The EIU sends the following: - digital output signals on ARINC 429 buses, - discrete signals which are of the 28V DC/open circuit or ground/open circuit types. EEC INTERFACE The EIU receives 2 ARINC 429 output data buses from EEC channels A and B and it uses data from the channel in control. If some data is not available from the control channel, data from the other channel is used. The EIU looks at particular engine data on the EEC digital data flow to interface this with other aircraft computers and with cockpit panels for control and monitoring. The EIU sends information, coming from all aircraft computers, which have to communicate with the EEC, through an output ARINC 429 data bus. The EIU does not deal with Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and thrust lever information as they communicate directly with the EEC. NOTE: Note: There is no data flow during the EIU internal test or initialization. ECS INTERFACE The EIU receives two inputs from the Air Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) 1 and 2 of the Environmental Control System (ECS). The ECS determines the various air bleed configurations according to logics of the air conditioning, wing anti-ice and nacelle anti-ice. This information is transmitted by the EIU to the EEC to compute the bleed air demand required at the engine customer bleed ports. CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 169 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY - 28V DC for its own power supply and for the FADEC power supply, - 115V AC for engine ignition system power supply. ENGINE START CONTROL The EIU receives and generates all starting signals from the cockpit engine panels. Therefore engine starting is not possible in case of EIU failure. The control panels provide the EIU with the following signals: - engine start mode selector position, - master lever position, - manual start P/B. The EIU provides all starting signals to the EEC and to the ENGine start panel FAULT light. NOTE: Note: In case of EIU failure, the power supply for FADEC and ignition is preserved (fail safe position). CFDS INTERFACE The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) communicates with the BITE memory of the EIU and with the BITE memory of the EEC via the EIU. The EIU interfaces with the CFDIU to generate the EIU and the FADEC fault messages on the MCDU. To access the FADEC menu function, the CFDS interrogates the EEC BITE memory through the EIU. BMC INTERFACE There is an interface between the EIU and the pneumatic system Bleed Monitoring Computer (BMC) for engines 1 and 2. During engine start, the EIU generates a ground signal for the BMC when the start valve moves away from the closed position. On receipt of this ground signal, the BMC closes the pneumatic system Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV). OTHER INTERFACES The EIU also receives other signals from various aircraft systems for control and monitoring purposes. The EIU also generates signals for various aircraft systems. POWER SUPPLY The EIU receives the following: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 170 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL ...

Therefore, the FMGS sends all command signals for engine power management via the Flight Control Unit (FCU) and both EIUs. The FMGS assumes the following functions: - computation of Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) target, - selection of A/THR modes, - alpha floor protection, - flexible takeoff, - A/THR engagement. FEEDBACK The EEC directly sends specific feedback outputs to the FMGS without going through the EIU. The EIU also receives this data but does not transmit it to FMGS. The EEC feedback output data to Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) is as follows: - Thrust Resolver Angle (TRA), - EPR command, - EPR actual, - EPR target in feedback, - EPR limit, - EPR max, - EPR reference throttle, - thrust mode, - Fuel Flow (FF), - bleed configuration in feedback, - engine rating identification, - flexible temperature in feedback.

GENERAL The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) is electrically supplied by: - the A/C network when High Pressure Rotor Speed (N2) is below 10% or when the dedicated alternator has failed, - the dedicated alternator when N2 is above 10%. POWERING N2 \\< 10% The EEC is supplied by the A/C electrical power network when N2 is below 10%. Each channel is independently supplied by the A/C 28V DC through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The aircraft 28V DC permits: - automatic ground check of the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system before the engine is running, that is to say FADEC GrouND PoWeR ON, - engine starting: MASTER lever ON or mode selector on IGNition or CRANK, - powering the EEC while the engine reaches 10% of N2. NOTE: Note: An action on the ENGine FIRE P/B provides EEC power cut-off from the A/C network. MANUAL REPOWERING For maintenance purposes and MCDU engine tests, the ENGine FADEC GrouND PoWeR panel permits FADEC power supply to be restored on the ground with engines shut down. When the corresponding ENGine FADEC GrouND PoWeR P/B is pressed ON the EEC recovers its power supply. NOTE: Note: The FADEC is also repowered as soon as the engine start selector is in IGNition/START or CRANK position, or the MASTER lever is selected ON. NOTE: Note: the EIU takes its power from the same bus bar as the EEC. POWERING N2 > 10% As soon as the engine is running above 10% of N2, the dedicated alternator directly supplies the EEC. The dedicated alternator supplies each channel with three-phase AC power. Two transformer rectifiers provide 28V DC power supply to channels A and B. Switching between the A/C 28V DC supply and the dedicated alternator power supplies is done automatically by the EEC. AUTO DEPOWERING The FADEC is automatically depowered on the ground, through the EIU, after engine shutdown. EEC automatic depowering occurs on the ground: Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 174 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY GENERAL ...

The ignition system is made up of two independent subsystems energized by a relay box. Each subsystem includes an ignition exciter, a coaxial shield ignition lead and an igniter plug. The pneumatic starting system drives the engine High Pressure (HP) rotor at a speed high enough for a ground or in flight start to be initiated. The start system is made up of the start valve and the starter. Engine motoring could be performed for dry cranking or wet cranking sequences. CONTROL AND INDICATING The Electronic Engine Control (EEC) controls the ignition through the relay box and starting through the start valve, either in automatic or manual mode. The operation of the start valve and of the ignition system is displayed on the ENGINE ECAM page. AUTOMATIC START During an automatic start, the EEC opens the start valve, then the ignition exciter is energized when the HP rotor speed is nominal. The EEC provides full protection during the start sequence. When the automatic start is completed, the EEC closes the start valve and cuts off the ignition. In case of an incident during the automatic start the EEC aborts the start procedure. MANUAL START NOTE: during cranking ignition is inhibited. CONTINUOUS IGNITION With engine running, continuous ignition can be selected via the EEC either manually using the rotary selector or automatically by the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Safety precautions have to be taken prior to working in this area. WARNING: THE EEC AND THE RELAY BOX SEND 115 VOLTS TO THE IGNITION BOXES, WHICH CONVERT IT AND SEND HIGH ENERGY PULSES THROUGH THE IGNITION LEADS TO THE IGNITERS PLUGS. MAINTENANCE PRACTICES To increase A/C dispatch, the start valve is equipped with a manual override. For this manual operation, the mechanic has to be aware of the engine safety zones. During a manual start, the start valve opens when the engine MANual START P/B is pressed in, then the ignition system is energized when the MASTER control lever is set to the ON position. NOTE: there is no automatic shutdown function in manual mode.

All these systems are controlled by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). The booster stage bleed valve system is used for the booster compressor airflow discharge into the fan air stream to make sure that the booster compressor output matches the HPC requirements at low engine speed and deceleration. The VSV system directs the airflow into the HPC 4 initial stages to prevent blade stall and engine surge. Four bleed valves, three for the 7th stage and one for the 10th stage of the HPC, complete the compressor airflow control.

COMPRESSOR AIRFLOW CONTROL (continued) HANDLING BLEED VALVES Handling bleed valves are installed onto the H.P. compressor to improve engine starting, and prevent engine surge when the compressor is operating at off-design conditions. A total of four bleed valves are used, three on stage 7 and one on stage 10. The handling bleed valves are 'two position' only - fully open or fully closed, and are operated pneumatically by their respective solenoid control valve. The solenoid control valves are scheduled by the EEC. When the bleed valves are open, H.P. compressor air bleeds into the fan duct through ports in the inner barrel of the 'C' ducts. The servo air used to operate the bleed valves is H.P. compressor delivery air. The bleed valves are arranged radially around the H.P. compressor case. Silencers are used on some bleed valves. All the bleed valves are spring loaded to the open position and as a result will always be in the correct position (open) for starting. The bleed valves and the solenoid control valves operate in the same manner. The bleed valve is a two-position valve and is either fully open or fully closed. The bleed valve is spring loaded to the open position and so all the bleed valves will be in the correct open position for engine start. When the engine is started the bleed air will try to close the valve. The valve is kept in the open position by servo air (P3) supplied from the solenoid control valve, (solenoid de-energized) as shown below. The EEC will close the bleed valves at the correct time during acceleration. The bleed valve is closed by the EEC, which energizes the solenoid control valve, as shown below. Energizing the solenoid control valve vents the P3 servo air from the opening chamber of the bleed valve, and the valve will move to the closed position.

The BSBV gives improved surge margin during engine start and transient operation. The bleed valve is controlled by the EEC and is fully modulating, between the fully open and the fully closed positions. For starting the BSBV is fully open and will be progressively close during engine acceleration, while during cruise and take off the valve is fully closed. For deceleration and engine operation in reverse thrust the valve is fully open. In the event of an engine surge the valve is opened to recover the airflow through the compressor. The BSBV is a continuous ring valve that rotates and slides forward to open and rearwards to close. Ten support arms are driven via a lever and actuating rod by both BSBV actuators. The two actuators use the high-pressure fuel from the FMU as a hydraulic medium. The two BSBV actuators use pressurized fuel from the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) as a hydraulic medium. The actuators are located on the rear of the intermediate casing on both sides of the High Pressure Compressor. Only the left actuator interfaces with the EEC through a torque motor and is identified as the Master Actuator. The actuator on the right hand side is identified as the Slave Actuator. The two actuators are hydraulically linked to carry out a simultaneous operation. The Master Actuator includes a LVDT, which transmits the actuator position and therefore the BSBV position to the EEC.

The variable vanes control the angle at which the air enters the first three stages of the H.P. compressor. The angle varies with the H.P. compressor speed (N2); this reduces the risk of blade stall and compressor surge. The four stages of variable vanes comprises Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) in front of stage 3 and the Variable Stator Vanes (VSVs) behind the stages 3, 4, and 5. Mechanical Arrangement Each vane has pivots at its inner and outer ends, which allow the vane to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The outer end of each vane is shaped into a shaft, which goes through the compressor case and is attached by a short lever to a 'unison ring', (one unison ring for each stage). Short rods to a crankshaft connect the five unison rings. A short rod to an actuator that uses H.P. fuel as a hydraulic operating medium connects the crankshaft. Signals from the EEC direct the H.P. fuel to extend/retract the actuator. The actuator movement causes the crankshaft to rotate, and, through the unison rings, moves the variable stator vanes. The actuator has an LVDT, which sends actuator positional information back to the EEC.

The ACC system fulfills the blade tip clearances of the turbines for better performance. The EEC controls a dual ACC valve, which discharges fan air through manifolds to cool the surfaces of the HP and LP turbine cases during climb and cruise power operations. The continuous flow adapter supplies supplemental air, from the HPC 10th stage, to cool the stage 2 blades and HP 1 turbine disc bore.

Corrected N2 . Altitude The EEC commands an input signal to the torque motor. The torque motor positions the jet pipe servo valve. The torque motor can deflect the jet pipe servo valve to bias the direction of flow of the servo fuel pressure. The jet pipe servo valve controls the direction of flow of servo fuel pressure to effectively move the pilot valve. The pilot valve moves and gets servo fuel pressure to either side of the piston. Servo fuel pressure will act on one side of the piston at any one time when a movement is required. The movement of the piston moves a push pull rod that in turn operates the modulating air control valve. When stabilisation of the piston is required the EEC will cancel the input signal to the torque motor. This allows the jet pipe to return to the central position and as a result of this the pilot valve will move into the balanced position. Servo fuel pressure is now present on both sides of the pilot valve. The spring will bias the pilot valve position by forcing it to one side. The dual track LVDTs will send feedback signals to the EEC of the ACC system operation.

RATED N1 MODE In case of EPR sensor failure, i.e. P2 or P4.9, the EEC automatically reverts to the rated N1 mode. On the ECAM, the EPR indicator is crossed amber. The EEC uses TLA, ADR and T2. T2 is used in N1 rated mode to limit the engine thrust. To select N1 mode on both engines, the Engine N1 MODE P/Bs must be pressed in. NOTE: The auto thrust function is not available in N1 mode.

The throttle control lever is linked to a mechanical rod. This rod drives the input lever of the throttle control artificial feel unit. The throttle control lever moves over a range from -20 deg. TLA (Reverser Full Throttle stop) to +45 deg. TLA: o -20 degrees TLA corresponds to Reverser Full Throttle stop o +45 degrees TLA corresponds to Forward Full Throttle stop An intermediate mechanical stop is set to 0 deg.TLA. This stop is overridden when the reverse latching lever is pulled up for selection of the reverse power. This stop is reset as soon as the throttle control lever is selected back to forward thrust area. In the forward thrust area, there are two detent points, the MAX CLIMB detent point set to 25 deg.TLA and the MAX CONTINUOUS/FLEX TAKE-OFF detent point set to 35 deg.TLA. In the reverse thrust throttle range, there is one detent point at - 6 deg.TLA. This position agrees with the selection of the thrust reverser command and the Reverse Idle setting. In the middle throttle range (0deg. To 35 deg.TLA), the autothrust function can be active if engaged. This range agrees with the selection of MAX CLIMB or MAX CONTINUOUS thrust limit mode (in single operation). If the autothrust is not engaged, the engine control is manual. In the forward range (35 deg. To 45 deg.TLA), the autothrust function cannot be activated (except in alpha floor condition).This range agrees with the selection of FLEX TAKE-OFF/MAX TAKE-OFF Mode.

It connects the throttle artificial feel unit to the input lever of the throttle control unit. The throttle control unit comprises: -An input lever -Mechanical stops, which limit the angular range -2 resolvers (one resolver per FADEC (ECU/EEC) -6 potentiometers installed three by three -A device, which drives the resolver and the potentiometer -A pin device for rigging the resolver and potentiometers -1 switch whose signal is dedicated to the EIU -2 output electrical connectors The input lever drives two gear sectors assembled face to face. Each sector drives itself a set of one resolver and three potentiometers. The relationship between the throttle lever angle and throttle resolver angle (TRA) IS LINEAR AND 1 DEG.TLA = 1.9 TRA. The accuracy of the throttle control unit (error between the input lever position and the resolver angle) is 0.5 deg.TRA. The maximum discrepancy between the signals generated by two resolvers is 0.25 deg.TRA. The TLA resolver operates in two quadrants. The first quadrant is used for positive angles and the second quadrant for negative angles. Each resolver is dedicated to one FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) and receives its electrical excitation current (6 VAC) from the related FADEC channel (ECU / EEC) The ECU considers a throttle resolver angle value: o less than -47.5 deg.TRA or o greater than 98.8 deg.TRA as resolver position signal failure. The ECU includes a resolver fault accommodation logic. This logic allows engine operation after a failure or a complete loss of the throttle resolver position signal.

It consists of two translating sleeves, blocker doors and cascade vanes to redirect fan discharge airflow. The thrust reverser system is designed for use on the ground only to reduce aircraft landing roll. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 349 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY REVERSER DESIGN Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) CATTS LTD Issue 012 - Revision 000 - Dated 01/07/2023 Page 350 of 444 FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) HYDRAULIC SUPPLY The thrust reverser system is hydraulically actuated utilizing the aircraft hydraulic pressure from the corresponding engine. The thrust reverser system is isolated from the hydraulic supply by a Shut-Off Valve (SOV). ACTUATION Each translating sleeve is operated by two hydraulic actuators. The actuators receive fluid from the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU), which is controlled by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). When the deploy sequence is commanded the pressure in the lower actuators releases the locks as the four actuator pistons move rearward to deploy the reverser. The actuators are linked together by a synchronizing system. REVERSER CONTROL Basically the thrust reverser system is controlled through the EEC from the two reverser latching levers located on the throttle control levers. The HCU has an isolation valve and a directional valve to select deploy or stow mode. The directional valve is operated to deploy only. For third defense line purposes, the Spoiler Elevator Computers (SECs) have previously opened the SOV and the hydraulic pressure is supplied to the HCU. Then, the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) permits reverser deployment by energizing of the inhibition relay, so the directional valve can be opened by the EEC. To command the thrust reverser, the EEC needs an \"aircraft on ground\" signal supplied by the Landing Gear Control and Interface Units (LGCIUs). REVERSER INDICATING The actual state of the thrust reverser is shown on the upper ECAM, REV indication appears in the middle of the Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) dial. The signals come from the lock sensor and the Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT).

For maintenance purposes or to increase aircraft dispatch, the HCU is fitted with a manual deactivation lever to inhibit the thrust reverser system. In case of an inoperative thrust reverser, lockout pins stowed on the translating sleeves have to be installed to complete the deactivation procedure. WARNING: THE THRUST REVERSER SYSTEM SHOULD BE INHIBITED USING THE HCU DEACTIVATION LEVER BEFORE WORKING ON THE SYSTEM OR ON THE ENGINE. THE SYSTEM MUST BE DEACTIVATED IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE THRUST REVERSER FROM OPERATING ACCIDENTALLY AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES TO PERSONNEL AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE REVERSER.

THRUST REVERSER ACTUATION The hydraulic power required for the actuators is supplied by the normal aircraft hydraulic system: - Green system for engine 1, - Yellow system for engine 2. A Shut-Off Valve (SOV) located upstream of the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) make up an independent locking system. Each channel of the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) controls and monitors solenoid valves included in the HCU, which provides the deployment and stowage of two translating sleeves. Internal locks in the lower actuators are hydraulically operated. The operation of the actuators is synchronized by flexible drive shafts inside the deploy hydraulic lines, i.e. the synchronizing system. The HCU includes an isolation valve, a pressure switch and a directional valve, which is controlled through the inhibition relay.

The oil system lubricates and cools the bearings in the 3 bearing compartments. It also lubricates bearings and gears in the Angle Gearbox (AGB) and Main Gearbox (MGB). Oil cooling is controlled by a dedicated heat management system, which makes sure that engine oil, Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil and fuel temperatures are maintained within limits. The oil system is a dry sump full flow type system. The single pressure pump is independent of the 6 scavenge pumps (standard gear type). The 6 scavenge pumps are mounted on the MGB. The major components of the oil system are: oil tank, pressure and scavenge pumps, Fuel Cooled Oil Cooler (FCOC) and Air Cooled Oil Cooler (ACOC). Other components are a pressure filter included in the pressure pump, a scavenge filter, a de-oiler, a scavenge valve, chip detectors and sensors.

The oil temperature sensor is installed upstream of the Air Cooled Oil Cooler (ACOC) heat exchanger. This sensor is used for the heat management system, as controlled by the EEC There is no pressure regulator, so the oil pressure varies with N2. A pressure relief valve is used to limit the pressure during cold starts. The cold start pressure relief valve opens at 450 PSI. The pressurized oil that is filtered and then cooled by the Heat Exchangers according to the HMS control, is routed to each of the 3 bearing compartments, to the Angle gearbox and also the Main gearbox. The oil supply has: - an Low Oil Pressure (LOP) switch , - an Oil Pressure transmitter, These sensors are used for the ECAM indication and monitoring. The oil supply to the oil tank through the Anti Siphon Restrictor is used to clean the oil sight glass.

The pumps then return this oil to the tank through the scavenge filter. The oil tank content is measured by an oil quantity transmitter. The main scavenge line has: - a master chip detector for inspection, - an oil temperature sensor for indication, - an oil differential pressure switch which is used for monitoring and warning to the cockpit when the scavenge filter is clogged. If the scavenge filter becomes clogged a differential pressure switch sends a signal to the ECAM and eventually the by-pass valve will open. The ECAM is activated when the differential pressure is greater than 12 PSI. The by-pass valve opens at 20 PSI.

This dual-purpose line is piped through the two-position No. 4 bearing scavenge valve (and then continues to the deoiler). The two-position scavenge valve opens to the maximum flow area at low power to maximum scavenging. At high power this valve closes to the minimum area to maintain the seal pressure differentials and reduce overboard loss of vent air. The valve operates in the following manner. There are two basic operating positions, low power and high power. In the low-power position, where the compressor 10th stage pressure (P10) is less than 150 PSI, the valve is held spring loaded in the fully open position. The bearing compartment scavenge flow goes through the valve, restricted only by the porting in the valve seat. As the engine power increases, the P10 pressure rises. When this pressure exceeds 150 psi, the valve moves away from the max flow stop. This is due to the pressure acting on the differential areas of the valve and overcoming the spring load. The valve moves towards the min flow or high power setting. As the valve moves towards the peripheral ports in the seat, totally closing these ports, the flow through the valve is now restricted to one central port in the valve seat. Full travel is achieved at P10 pressure of approximately 210 psi. As the valve moves away from the max flow stop, the influence of the magnets on the reed switch decreases and the reed switch opens. The circuit is broken, indicating that the valve has moved. As the engine power decreases, the spring load overcomes the decreasing P10 pressure. The valve moves towards the max flow or low power position, uncovering the ports in the valve seat and restoring maximum flow through the valve. As the valve approaches the maximum flow stop, the influence of the magnets on the reed switch increases. The reed switch closes, completing the circuit and indicating the valve position. Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500) The function of the No.4 bearing indicating system is to monitor the correct operation of the No.4 bearing 2-position scavenge valve and to detect a No.4 bearing carbon-seal failure. The No.4 bearing pressure transducer is installed on the right side of the deoiler and senses pressure at the No.4 bearing outlet line. The position indicator is integral with the No.4 bearing scavenge valve which is located in the No.4 bearing compartment scavenge line. At engine low power, the valve is open and the switch closes sending a ground signal. At engine high power, the valve closes and the switch opens. The EIU has two logics, allowing the monitoring of the No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve operation as well as the No. 4 bearing carbon seal failure.

DO NOT TOUCH THE FUEL OR OIL SYSTEM COMPONENTS FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER THE ENGINE SHUTDOWN, THE ENGINE COMPONENTS STAY HOT FOR SOME TIME AND CAN CAUSE INJURY. Before removing the IDG, the engine must be shut down for at least 5 minutes to prevent burns because the oil stays hot for a few minutes. First of all, the IDG must be drained and the oil tubes disconnected and removed. Also remove the banjo couplings and note their initial positions. Then disconnect the three electrical connectors from the IDG. Remove the cover plate of the IDG terminal box and disconnect the output cables. Next place the special dolly in position and raise it up to the IDG. When the IDG is on the dolly, release the quick-attach/detach coupling then pull the IDG FWD to disengage it. Let's now see the IDG installation. Using the dolly, lift the IDG up to its position and align the open marks on the quick-attach/detach coupling. When the IDG is engaged, tighten the coupling sufficiently to secure it, then remove the dolly, reconnect the electrical connectors and reinstall the oil tubes. CAUTION: Do not let engine oil fall on the engine, unwanted oil must be removed immediately. The oil can cause damage to the surface protection and to some parts. Help the IDG out in a straight line, the input shaft can catch and cause damage to the input seal. Do not use external parts or tools to pull the IDG from the gearbox, they can cause damage. Do not apply side loads which could bend the splined drive shaft during the installation of the IDG. A bent splined drive shaft will prevent correct installation of the IDG and damage it in operation. Make sure that you do not damage the input seal during the installation of the IDG. Make sure that the tubes are not stressed, this can cause damage. The square washers must be installed between the phase cables and the terminal block on the IDG to prevent the terminal block becoming hot and causing damage to the IDG.

Let the temperature of the IDG decrease to 120\u00b0F (48,8\u00b0C) or less before you drain the oil. Do not touch the IDG system components for a short time after the engine is shut down. The engine components stay hot for some time and can cause injury. If the oil is below the minimum level, the green band, add oil to the IDG. Now prepare the IDG for servicing. Remove the caps from the overflow drain and pressure fill valves. First connect a drain hose to the overflow drain valve then connect the pressure fill hose from a service unit to the pressure fill valve. Using the service units, add oil, until the level reaches the full mark and the oil overflows through the drain hose. Drain oil until the oil level moves down to the green band. Remove the drain and pressure fill hoses from connectors and reinstall the caps. Finally perform a leak test. Do another check of the oil level 5 minutes later. NOTE: This procedure is to let the air escape from the IDG oil system and to let the oil flow around the system. CAUTION: Do not let engine oil fall on the engine, unwanted oil must be removed immediately. The oil can cause damage to the surface protection and to some parts. The drain hose must be connected to let the oil in the IDG drain to the correct level. The IDG can become too hot if it contains too much oil. Do not operate the IDG without sufficient or with too much oil, this will cause damage to the IDG.

This is acceptable. MEL / DEACTIVATION (continued) TEST SET OF 7TH and 10TH STAGE BLEED VALVE AND SOLENOID When you do the test of the bleed valve, listen carefully to the bleed valve. If necessary, use the stethoscope supplied with the test set. If possible, use a light source (torch and mirror) to see the movement of the bleed valve. If you hear a click when the bleed valve closes or if you see the bleed valve move, the test is correct (PASS). If there is no movement of the bleed valve, the test is not correct (FAIL). If you are not sure, remove the silencer and do an inspection for physical movement. To do the test of the solenoid, it is important to put a WARNING NOTICE(S) to tell persons not to start the engine. Use the hand pump to get 20 psi on the solenoid input pressure gauge. Read the value on the solenoid output pressure gauge. The test is correct (PASS) if the solenoid output pressure increases quickly to +0/-5 psi of solenoid input pressure. It is possible that the pressure on the two gauges will slowly decrease. If the pressure continues to decrease for more than 5 seconds, this is acceptable. The test is not correct (FAIL) if the difference between the solenoid output pressure and the solenoid input pressure is more than 5 psi. If the pressure decreases for less than 5 seconds, reject the solenoid. Then, the Green CONTINUITY light comes on and the solenoid output pressure is zero. (It is possible that the solenoid output pressure gauge will momentarily show a pressure value when the TEST SWITCH pushbutton is pushed. This is acceptable.) If the CONTINUITY light does not come on or if the solenoid output pressure is more than zero, the test is not correct (FAIL) (it is possible that an indication will be shown momentarily when you push the TEST SWITCH pushbutton for the first time. This is acceptable.)

For troubleshooting and leak isolation the drain mast body has separate drains identified and visible with the cowls closed. The pylon drain tubes collect fluids from individual pylon chambers, also for leak isolation. If fluid leaks are found during transit operations, run the engine at idle for 5 minutes. If the leak stops, the aircraft may be dispatched without maintenance action. If leaks continue after 5 minutes, consult the AMM (ATA 71-70) for maximum permitted leakage limits for all of the drains. There are 2 limits for each drain. If the first limit is exceeded, the aircraft may be dispatched and can continue to operate for a maximum of 25 hours or 10 flights as long as the second limit is not exceeded. Here are some examples of engine drains with both leakage limits. See the AMM for complete list.

Start the lifting using the pulley levers and check that the dynamometers show the correct load. Raise the engine cradle gradually. As the engine reaches the pylon take care that the FWD and rear mounts engage correctly. Then install the bolts to both mounts and tighten them. Note that you never use the same bolts. Always change them for new or inspected ones. When the engine cradle is on the trolley remove the four chain pulley blocks and dynamometers, then the bootstrap equipment. Reconnect all lines and electrical harnesses to the pylon interfaces. Finally lock the cradle to the trolley. Push the trolley out from under the engine and remove the hold-open braces from the cowls. The engine can now be put back in serviceable condition. NOTE: Avoid any dynamic effect during descent.

Operational Interruptions are composed of: - Ground Interruptions which are flight delays greater than 15 minutes and flight cancellations. - Air Interruptions which are air turn-backs and diversions. Operational Interruptions are used in: - Engineering (Supportability and Safety) and Program organisation to make OI rate performance prediction against targets during the design process of new aircraft, - Customer Services organisation to measure OI rate performance for InService Aircraft and propose modifications to improve it. Operational Liaison Visit Aircraft Operation/Operations Engineering Operational Reliability Aircraft Operation/General Visit paid by Flight Operations Support involving a Flight Test or a Training Pilot to an airline to bring operational Support. Operational liaison visits usually consist in meeting with the airline Operations (Operations Engineering and Fleet Chief Pilot) and in observation flights to assess the airline operational needs. Operational Reliability (OR) is the percentage of scheduled flights which depart and arrive without incurring a (technical) operational interruption including ground and air interruptions. Ground interruptions are flight dispatch delays greater than 15 minutes and flight cancellations. Air interruptions are air turnbacks and diversions. Operational Reliability performance is used in: - Engineering (Supportability and Safety) and Program organisation to make OR performance prediction against targets during the design process of new aircraft, - Customer Services organisation to measure OR performance for In-Service Aircraft and propose modifications to improve it.

ISO 8402 Notes: 1. In a contractual environment or in a regulated environment, such as the nuclear safety field needs are specified, whereas in other environments, implied needs should be identified and defined. 2. In many instances, needs can change with time; this implies periodic review of requirements for quality. 3. Needs are usually into characteristics with specified criteria. Needs may include for example, aspects of performance, usability, dependability, (availability, reliability, maintainability), safety, environment, economics and aesthetics. 4. The term \"quality\" should not be used as a single term to express a degree of excellence in a comparative sense nor should it be used in a quantitative sense for technical evaluations. To express these meanings, a qualifying adjective should be used. For example, use can be made of the following terms: a) \"relative quality\" where entities are ranked on a relative basis in the \"degree of excellence\" or \"comparative sense\" (not to be confused with grade); b) \"quality level\" in a \"quantitative sense\" (as used in acceptance sampling) and \"quality measure\" where precise technical evaluations are carried out. 5. The achievement of satisfactory quality involves all stages of the quality loop as a whole. The contributions to quality of these various stages are sometimes identified separately for emphasis; for example quality due to definition of needs, quality due to product design, quality due to conformance, quality due to product support through its lifetime. In some references, quality is referred to as \"fitness for use\" or \"fitness for purpose\" or \"customer satisfaction\" or \"conformance to the requirements\". These represent only certain facets of quality as defined above. Approved Terms \u00a9 Airbus SAS 2007. All rights reserved.

Notes: 1. These are both internal and external purposes for quality assurance. a) Internal quality assurance: within an organization, quality assurance provides confidence to the management. b) External quality assurance: in contractual or other situations, quality assurance provides confidence to the customers or others. 2. Some quality control and quality assurance actions are interrelated. 3. Unless requirements for quality fully reflect the needs of the user, quality assurance may not provide adequate confidence. ISO 8402 Quality Audit Quality Systematic and independent examination to determine whether quality activities and related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives. Notes: 1. Often called \"quality system audit\", \"process quality audit\", \"product quality audit\" or \"service quality audit\". 2. Quality audits are carried out by staff not having direct responsibility in the areas being audited but, preferably, working in cooperation with the relevant personnel. 3. One purpose of a \"quality audit\" is to evaluate the need for improvement or corrective action. An audit should not be confused with quality \"surveillance\" or \"inspection\" activities performed for the purpose of process control or product acceptance. 4. Quality audits can be conducted for internal or external purposes. ISO 8402 Quality Control Quality Operational techniques and activities that are used to fulfill requirements for quality. Notes: 1. Quality control involves operational techniques and activities aimed both at monitoring a process and at eliminating causes of unsatisfactory performance at all stages of the quality loop in order to achieve economic effectiveness. 2.

On March 11, 1983, five of the worlds leading aerospace manufacturers signed a 30 year collaboration agreement to produce an engine for the single isle aircraft market with the best proven technology that each could provide. The five organisations were: \u2022 Pratt and Whitney -- Combustion Chamber and High Pressure Turbine. \u2022 Japanese Aero engine Corporation (JAEC) - Fan and Low Pressure Compressor. \u2022 Rolls Royce plc - United Kingdom. \u2022 \u2022 Pratt and Whitney - USA.

In December of the same year the collaboration was incorporated in Zurich, Switzerland, as IAE International Aero Engines AG, a management company established to direct the entire program for the shareholders. The headquarters for IAE were set up in East Hartford, Connecticut, USA and the V2500 turbofan engine to power the 120-180 seat aircraft was launched on January 1st 1984. Each of the shareholder companies was given the responsibility for developing and delivering one of the five engine modules. They are: Revision 2 Note: Rolls Royce have developed and introduced the wide chord fan to the V2500 engine family. The senior partners Rolls Royce and Pratt and Whitney assemble the engines at their respective plants in Derby England and Middletown Connecticut USA. IAE is responsible for the co-ordination of the manufacture and assembly of the engines. IAE is also responsible for the sales, marketing and in service support of the V2500. Note: Fiat Aviazione have since withdrawn as a risksharing partner, but still remains as a Primary Supplier. Rolls Royce now has responsibility for all external gearbox related activity.

The 'V' is the Roman numeral for five. The 2500 numbering indicated the first engine type to be released into production. This engine was rated at 25000lbs of thrust. For ease of identification of the present and all future variants of the V2500, IAE has introduced an engine designation system. Introduction \u2022 The designation V2500-D collectively describes all applications for the Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft. \u2022 The V2500-A collectively describes all the applications for the Airbus Industries aircraft. This is irrespective of engine thrust rating. The number given after the alpha indicates the mechanical standard of the engine. For example; \u2022 \u2022 All engines possess the V2500 numbering as a generic name. \u2022 The first three characters of the full designation are V25. This will identify all the engines in the family. \u2022 The next two figures indicate the engines rated sea level takeoff thrust. \u2022 The following letter shows the aircrafts manufacturer. Note: \u2022 The last figure represents the mechanical standard of the engine. The D5 variant is now no longer in production, however the engine is still extensively overhauled and re-furbished. V2527-A5. The only engine exempt from these idents is the current service engine, which is already certified to the designated V2500-A1. There is only one standard of this engine rating and is utilised on the Airbus A320 aircraft. This system will provide a clear designation of a particular engine as well as a simple way of grouping by name engines with similar characteristics.

If these procedures are not followed damage to the engine can occur. Caution: You must do all the applicable procedures when an engine is put into storage. If they are not, corrosion and general deterioration of the core engine and the fuel system can occur. The task 72-00-00-500-001 gives details of the required procedures for preservation and storage of the engine or QEC unit that is to be stored or transported. Protective treatment for the engine is dependant on the climatic conditions in which the engine is to be stored. Refer to task 72-00-00-500-002. Revision 2 Propulsion System Prepare the engine for storage. Additional storage requirements refer to fig below. 72-00-00990-243. Note: 1. The use of VMI bags affords maximum protection to the engine/QEC unit and must be utilised wherever possible, regardless of the storage environment and time period. 2. Use a full polythene cover or similar, secured around the engine, and engine stand preventing the ingress of dirt, grit and sand. 3. If the same conditions can be achieved, without the use of a VMI, use full engine protection from direct and indirect moisture as well as protection from adverse weather conditions and ingress of any type, then this is allowed. Desiccant must still be used in accordance with TASK 7200-00-500-005 and the integrity of the engine covers must be checked periodically Page 2-39 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Propulsion System Page 2-39 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Propulsion System Cooling & Ventilation (Chapter 75) Fire Protection (Chapter 26) Revision 2 Page 2-40 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance The purpose of fire protection is to give an indication to the flight deck of a possible fire condition about the engine. The purpose of the ventilation system is to provide a flow of cooling air about the engine to reduce the risk of a fire condition annunciation to the flight deck. Location The locations of the fire detection fire wires are about the fan casing and core engine. The location of the ventilation air is about the entire of the fan case and core engine. Description The engine is ventilated to provide a cooling airflow for maintaining the engine components within an acceptable operating temperature. Fire Protection and Ventilation Zone 1 ventilation Ram air enters the zone through an inlet located on the upper LH side of the air intake cowl. The air circulates through the fan compartment and exits at the exhaust located on the bottom rear centre line of the fan cowl doors. Zone 2 ventilation Metered holes within the inner barrel of the \"C\" duct allow pressurized fan air to enter the zone 2 area. Air exhausting from the active clearance control (ACC) system around the turbine area also provides ventilation air for Zone 2. Also to provide a flow of air that assists in the removal of potential combustible liquids that may be in the area. The air circulates through the core compartment and exits through the lower bifurcation of the C ducts via the thrust recovery duct. Ventilation is provided for; Ventilation during ground running \u2022 The fan case area (Zone 1). \u2022 The core engine area (Zone 2). During ground running local pockets of natural convection exist providing some ventilation of the fan case zone 1. Zones 1 and 2 are ventilated to; \u2022 Prevent accessory and component over heating. \u2022 Prevent the accumulation of flammable vapours. Revision 2 Zone 2 ventilation is provided by fan duct pressure as above, during ground running and flight.

Zone 1 and Zone 2 fire detectors function independently of each other. When the air temperature increases to a pre determined level the system provides flight deck warning. Each zone has two detector units which are mounted as a pair, each unit gives an output signal when a fire or overheat condition occurs. Location The fire detection system is located: \u2022 Routed around the high-speed external gearbox. \u2022 At BDC of the core engine nearest to the combustor diffuser case. Description The two detector units are attached to support tubes by clips. Nacelle air temperature (NAC) Zone 2 has the nacelle air temperature sensor. Indication is to the flight deck when a temperature exceedance has occurred. The V2500 utilises a Systron Donner fire detection system. It has a gas filled core and relies upon heat exposure to increase the internal gas pressure. Thus triggering sensors. When the air temperature about the fan case and/or core engine increases to a pre-determined level the system is designed to detect this and display a warning message and indications to the flight deck. The system provides flight deck warning by: \u2022 Master warning light. \u2022 Audible warning tone. \u2022 Specific ECAM fire indications. \u2022 Engine fire push button illuminates. Revision 2 Page 2-43 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Fire Protection and Ventilation Page 2-44 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Fire Protection and Ventilation Fire Detection System and Detector Units Firewire detectors The fire detection system employs detector units called firewires. Each of the firewire detector units comprises of the following; The firewires are mounted in pairs. This is necessary due to the level 3 class 1 message that they generate when a fire or overheat condition exists. \u2022 A hollow sensor tube. \u2022 A responder assembly. The fire detection system comprises of the following units; Sensor tube \u2022 The firewires send a signal to the Fire Detection Unit (FDU). The sensor tube is closed and sealed at one end and the other open end is connected to the responder. \u2022 The FDU sends a signal to the Flight Warning Computer (FWC). The tube is filled with helium gas and carries a central core of ceramic material impregnated with hydrogen. \u2022 The FWC generates the flight deck indications for a fire condition. An increase in the air temperature around the sensor tube causes the helium to expand and increase until the pressure causes the alarm switch to close. The FDU recognises this as an abnormal situation, hence fire indication will be illuminated. There is one FDU per engine. The FDU has two channels, each channel is looking at a separate fire detector loop of zones 1 and 2. Under normal conditions both firewires require to be indicating to the FDU to give a real indication to the flight deck. If a 'burn through' occurs, the pressure within the sensing tube is lost and as a result of this the integrity switch opens to give an indication to the FDU of a loop failure. If there is a single loop failure of more than 16 seconds then the remaining firewire will continue to operate. The FDU will recognise the faulty fire loop. Responder The faulty loop will be indicated to ECAM as the following message; \u2022 The normally open switch is the alarm indication. \u2022 The normally closed switch is the fault indication. ENG 1 (2) FIRE LOOP A (B) FAULT The responder has two pressure switches, one normally open and the other normally closed. If there is a double loop failure then the FDU will recognise this as a possible burn through and the fire message will be generated to the flight deck.

The compartment is sealed using air supported carbon seals, plus an oil filled (Hydraulic) seal between the H.P. and L.P. shafts. The 8th stage compressor air supports this seal. Adequate pressure drops across the seals to ensure satisfactory sealing are achieved by venting the compartment, by an external tube to the de-oiler. Gearbox Drive The HP Stubshaft, which is located axially by the Number 3 Bearing, has at it's front end a bevel drive gear which, through the 'Tower Shaft' provides the drive for the Main Accessory Gearbox. The HP Stubshaft separates from the HP Compressor Module at the 'Curvic Coupling' and remains as part of the Intermediate Module.

A Phonic Wheel is fitted to the LP Stub Shaft; this interacts with speed probes to provide LP Shaft speed signals (N1) to the Engine Electronic Control (EEC) (see section 11 -- Engine Indicating). A speed signal is also provided to the Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU), which is located in the Aircraft Avionics Compartment. The Hydraulic Seal prevents oil leakage from the compartment passing rearwards between the H.P. and L.P. shafts. The Number 3 Bearing is hydraulically damped. The outer race is supported by a series of eighteen spring rods, which allow some slight radial movement of the bearing. The bearing is centralised by rods and any radial movement is dampened by oil pressure fed to an annulus around the bearing outer race. The gearbox gear is splined onto the H.P. shaft and retained by the Number 3 Bearing Nut.

The bearing compartment is shielded from radiated heat by a heat shield and an insulating supply of relatively cool air. This supply of cooled air (called 'buffer air') is admitted to the space between the chamber and first heat shield. The buffer air is exhausted from the cooling spaces close to the upstream side of the carbon seals, creating an area of cooler air from which the sealing function is obtained. This results in an acceptable temperature of the air flowing across the face of the carbon seals into the bearing compartment. Restrictors at the outlet from the cooling passage control buffer airflow rates. The bearing compartment internal pressure level is determined by the area of the variable scavenge valve. (No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve described in the oil system). Essentially this valve acts as a variable flow restrictor in the No 4 Bearing Compartment vent line.

An air supported (Stage 8) carbon seal seals the compartment at the front end. At the rear is a simple cover plate, with an 'O' ring type seal, secured by twelve bolts. Inside the compartment sealing is achieved on the LP shaft end by a small disc type plug, with a 'spring supported jacket cup' ring seal secured by a double helix spring clip. There are no air or oil flows down the LP shaft. Separate venting is not necessary for this compartment because with only one carbon seal, the airflow induced by the scavenge pump provides the required pressure drop across the seal. The pressure supply and scavenge oil pipes are covered by an insulating heat shield material.

The internal vane baffles and airfoil cooling holes permit relatively cool air from the diffuser case to go through the vane and over the external airfoil to decrease metal temperature. Sheet-metal seals between adjacent vane platforms decrease leakage of the cool air. The stage 1 turbine nozzle assembly has 40 air-cooled vanes, made of cobalt alloy. The vanes are attached to the stage 1 HPT cooling duct assembly with bolts. The stage 1 has 40 vanes; each hollow vane has internal baffles and cooling holes in the airfoil. Vane airfoils also have a heat-resistant coating. The stage 1 vanes are held in position by the stage 1 HPT cooling duct assembly. The duct is installed on the rearinner flange of the diffuser case. Operation The ring of vanes makes a series of nozzles, which increases the velocity of the gases from the combustion chamber. The vanes direct the combustion chamber Revision 2 Page 3-33 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Mechanical Arrangement Page 3-34 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Mechanical Arrangement HP Turbine Description The primary parts of the HP turbine rotor and stator assembly are: The primary parts of the stage 2 rotor assembly are: \u2022 \u2022 The HP Turbine Rotor Assemblies (Stage 1 and 2) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The HP Turbine Case and Vane Assembly The HP turbine rotor assemblies are two stages of turbine hubs with single-crystal, nickel-alloy blades. The two-hub configuration removes a bolt flange between hubs. This decreases the weight and enables faster engine assembly. The blades have airfoils with high strength and resistance to creep. Satisfactory blade tip clearances are supplied by Active Clearance Control (ACC) to cool the case with compressor air. The primary parts of the stage 1 rotor assembly are: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Stage 1 Turbine Hub Inner and Outer HPT Air Seals 64 Blades Rear HPT Air Seal Revision 2 Stage 2 Turbine Hub 72 Blades Stage 2 Blade Retaining Plate The inner and outer HPT air seals are installed on the front of the stage 1 hub. The stage 1 blades are installed in slots on the hub. The blades are held on the forward side by the outer HPT air seal. The stage 2 HPT air seal is installed on the rear of the stage 1 hub. This air seal holds the stage 1 blades on the rear side. Stage 1 blades and Nozzle Guide Vanes are cooled using H.P. Compressor discharge air. The stage 2 turbine hub is installed behind the stage 1 hub and the stage 2 HPT air seal. Stage 2 blades are installed in slots in the hub. The blades are held on the forward side by the stage 2 HPT air seal. The blades are held on the rear side by the stage 2 blade retaining plate. Stage 2 HPT blade cooling air is a mixture of HPC discharge air and stage 10 compressor air. This air passes through holes in the stage 1 HPT (front inner) air seal and the stage 1 turbine hub into the area between the hubs. The air then goes into the stage 2 blade root and out the trailing-edge cooling holes.

HP Turbine Combustor LP Turbine SB 72-0221 introduces a new diffuser case assembly. The LP turbine has borescope inspection for the stage three leading edge only. A1 Diffuser Case (Pre SB 72-0221) Access to inspect the combustion chamber and the HPT stage 1 vanes is by 5 plugs with gaskets. These are numbered: \u2022 B1 to B4 for the left hand side of the engine. \u2022 B5 and the 2 igniter plug ports for the right hand side of the engine. A1 Diffuser Case (Post SB 72-0221) The HP turbine has provision for inspection of the leading and trailing edges of the blades. Note: When installing borescope access features to the combustion system and HPT stage 1 the threads of the fasteners must be coated with an anti galling compound and an anti seizure compound as recommended by the AMM. When installing borescope access features to the HPT stage 2 and LPT stage 3 the threads of the fasteners must be coated with engine oil as recommended by the AMM. Access to inspect the combustion chamber and the HPT stage 1 vanes is by 6 plugs with gaskets. These are numbered: \u2022 B1 to B5 for the left hand side of the engine. \u2022 B6 and the 2 igniter plug ports for the right hand side of the engine. Note: The borescope access ports are located near the diffuser case rear flange. The ports must not be confused with the 5 larger locating pins that are equi spaced around the forward end of the case.

It is secured to the front blade-retaining ring by 24 bolts. A Fairing is attached to the front blade-retaining ring by 6 bolts. Note: Balance weights must not be placed at these 6 bolt locations on the fairing. The Nose Cone is balanced during manufacture by applying weights to its inside surface. The nose cone is un-heated. A soft rubber cone tip provides ice protection. As ice builds up on the tip, it becomes un-balanced and flexes. This causes the ice to be dislodged from the rubber tip and is then ingested by the fan before it has built up to a significant mass. The Nose Cone retaining bolt flange is faired by a titanium fairing which is secured by six bolts. The arrangement is shown below. Note: Take care when removing the Nose Cone retaining bolts. Balance weights may be fitted to some of the bolts. The position of these bolts with their respective weights must be marked before removal, so as to ensure they are refitted to the same position. Revision 2 Page 4-1 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Page 4-2 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Front Blade Retaining Ring The Assembly is shown below. The Front Blade Retaining Ring is secured to the Fan Disk by a ring of 36 bolts. A second (outer ring) passes through the retaining ring and permits the individual securing of the Annulus Fillers by 22 bolts. Both these sets of bolts must be removed before attempting to remove the Front Blade Retaining Ring. After the removal of the 22 annulus filler securing bolts and all 36 retaining ring bolts, it is possible to remove the front blade retaining ring by the use of 6 'pusher bolts being inserted into 6 threaded holes designed specifically for this purpose. Note: The fan blades and annulus filler positions are not identified. For this reason it is important to identify and make a note of the original blade and annulus filler positions prior to their removal. When the Nose Cone is fitted, it is possible to identify the positions of blades numbers 1,2 and 3 by noting that the front blade retaining ring has etched on it's outer edge these blade number positions. These numbers are marked in a counter-clockwise direction when viewing the engine from the front. Having established the original positions of the blades it is important to number the blades and their corresponding annulus filler by using an approved marker pen (Material VS 06-69 ref 70-30-00).

Vibration limits and fan guidelines: a) trim balance vibration Vibration Limits (Steady State) \u2212 N1 (peak): 5.0 Units. \u2212 N2 (peak): 5.0 Units. 1. Engines that have vibrations within the vibration limits are acceptable. 2. Engines that have N1 peak vibrations that exceeds the above limit, troubleshoot as per Trouble Shooting Manual (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-826) or (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-827). 3. Engines that have N2 peak vibrations that exceeds the above limit, troubleshoot as per Trouble Shooting Manual (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-828) or (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-829). 4. A non-revenue ferry flight to a maintenance base is permissible with N1 or N2 vibration above limits, if no fault in the respective trouble shooting procedures in steps 2 and 3 above. This condition is permissible for only one engine per aircraft. Revision 2 b) Vibration guidelines \u2212 N1 (peak): 2.0 Units 1. Fan trim balance is recommended any time N1 peak vibration exceeds this 2.0 Unit guideline. Perceivable airframe vibrations generally accompany N1 vibration levels above this guideline value. Waiting until N1 peak vibration approaches or exceeds the 5.0 unit limit may require multiple fan trim balances to bring N1 vibration down to an acceptable value. Note: 5.0 units (Aircraft ECAM display) = 1.5 inches per second of displacement due to the imbalance. 2. Aircraft/Flight correlation. Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) \u2212 As stated in the FCOM, if N2 vibration during engine start exceeds limit, the start should be aborted. Subsequent starts may be initiated without maintenance action for up to three start attempts. \u2212 The above limits and guidelines are stable (steady state) and as such may not be stable, therefore the aircraft level is advisory and not a limit. Vibration above the advisory level may or may not require maintenance action, as described in the FCOM; initially depending on icing conditions or other engine parameter shifts and finally if the advisory level is confirmed at steady state conditions. Page 4-5 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Page 4-6 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Fan Trim Balance There are two methods available to balance the fan, the 'one shot' and 'trial weight' the method. Both use data gained from the Engine Vibration Monitoring system (EVMS). Caution: The one shot method allows balancing of the fan with fewer engine ground runs required and has proved itself effective in service use. An N1 Keep-Out-Zone (KOZ) of 61-74% N1 (AOW1056) has been introduced during all stages of engine operation on the ground, including Ground Testing, Taxiing and 'Hold' periods. This is to prevent the blade from experiencing high stresses as a result of 'Fan Blade flutter'. This is particularly acute during 'cross-wind' conditions. The KOZ is being incorporated into EEC software (availability A5 SCN17-3rd Qtr 2002) If necessary a Vibration survey (Test No 8) may be performed to obtain the vibration characteristics of the engine. Note: \u2022 If vibration exceeds limits during the survey ground run, slowly bring engine speed to idle and shutdown. \u2022 Angles are counter clockwise viewed from the front of the engine. Data: (speed, amplitude and phase angle) may be collected on ground or during cruise flight, collection in flight is either automatic or for selected speeds and on the ground may be manually selected ref: AMM. Operate both engines for this test with the non-test engine set at 1.25 EPR for aircraft stability. Engine speed greater than 85% N1 (4645 rpm) can cause aircraft buffeting. For cruise flight, data at 5 speeds, pre-selected or automatically is collected. Data stored in the memory of the EVMU is accessed through the MCDU menu in the flight deck and should be printed for later reference and calculation. Best results are obtained from data in the 80-90% N1 speed range with 85% N1 being the best single speed point, for ground running an average of correction.

The data collection will be via the aircraft EVMU system. Data may be collected during a ground run or in cruise flight. Definitions \u2022 Speed (N1) expressed as a percentage 100% = 5650 rpm. Note! (1% N1 = 56.5 rpm) \u2022 Amplitude (U) indicated vibration levels expressed in Mils (P-P) from the EVMU system. LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Acquire in flight, read on ground) or Task 77-32-34-869010 (Acquisition of unbalance data on ground). Some aircraft are fitted with software (customer option) which permits the engineer to interrogate via the MCDU the stored data regarding out of balance correction required. This information is contained in the EVMU and by accessing the EVMU Engine Unbalance menu, it is possible to establish the necessary adjustments required to eliminate out of balance situations. Note: \u2022 Phase Angle (A) indicated angle in degrees from the EVMU system. \u2022 Phase Lag (B) dynamic phase lag of the LP system between phase angle and true position of unbalance. Prior to carrying out any adjustments, the engineer must first confirm the accuracy of the current status regarding the configuration of weights (position and part number) that are already installed and recorded in the system. Mass Coefficient (K) value by which the amplitude must be multiplied to give correction mass required or a given speed To accomplish this it is necessary to physically verify the position and part number of the balance weights already installed onto the front blade-retaining ring. Fan Trim Balance with the EVMU (One Shot Method) Task (77-32-34-750-010) This procedure can be used for consecutive fan trim balances if necessary. If consecutive fan trim balances with this method do not give significant results, carryout a fan trim balance with the 'Trial Weight' method.

The blade to be removed can than be pulled forward to clear the dovetail slot in the fan disc. Examine the outer surface of the Annulus Filler for cracks, nicks, dents and scores. Limits in the AMM can be applied to assess the damage for accept or reject. If the surface coating of the annulus filler is damaged to the point of requiring a repair the AMM has a procedure that allows this to be done. AMM ref 72-31-11-300-010 gives comprehensive instructions as to the correct procedure for repair.

If the Annulus Filler is not correctly installed, it is possible that when the Front Retaining Ring is subsequently torque tightened in place onto the Fan Disk, it may result in the deformation and displacement of the Rear Retaining Ring. This could cause it to come into contact with the inlet housing of LP Compressor Module.

If this were to be left uncorrected, it is possible that the Fan Blade would be displaced slightly prevented from it's normal radial operating position. \u2022 Note: If this is difficult to do, it can be an indication that the seal is caught. \u2022 Slide the plastic strip forward to move the seal into the correct position. Accomplish this procedure on both sides of the Fan Blade starting at the trailing edge of the blade and moving it forward to the leading edge. \u2022 Note: When the seal is in the correct position you can easily move the plastic strip from the front to the rear of the blade. This in turn would cause the Fan Module to become unbalanced and vibration levels for the engine could be exceeded. The task referenced above documents the procedure to eliminate this. The task requires a stiff plastic strip to be used to reposition the seals if they ' rolled' as shown in the diagram below. Note: An expired credit card is suitable, or a plastic checklist card Caution: Make sure the plastic strip has a smooth surface and edges. If you use a strip with a rough edge surface or edges, damage to the seal can occur. Make sure that you do not break the plastic strip and leave pieces of it in the Fan. Pieces of plastic can damage the rubber.

This information is for guidance only and the AMM ref Chapter 71-31-11-200-010 should be used as the reference document. Blades are inspected for signs of the following; \u2022 Nick's. \u2022 Cracks. General \u2022 Dents. The fan blade surface area is divided into zones. The zones are; \u2022 Scores. \u2022 \u2022 Surface scratches. Ar. \u2022 \u2022 Bends on the leading or trailing edges. At. \u2022 Br. \u2022 Arc burns (lightning strikes). \u2022 Bt. \u2022 Cr. \u2022 Ct. \u2022 F. The acceptance limits for damage vary depending on which zone is damaged. Revision 2 Any blade, which has Arc burns or cracks must be rejected and a replacement blade fitted. An Arc burn is evident by a small circular or semi-circular heat affected area of the blade surface that may contain a shallow pitting, remelting or cracking. Visually a dark blue discoloration is associated with the heat-affected area Page 4-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Page 4-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Fan Blade Inspection General Fly Back Limits The leading and trailing edges of the fan blades should be examined for bends (deformations).

AMM 72-31-11-400-010 Method 3 When a replacement blade is installed, procedures to keep the balance of the LP compressor rotor are necessary. Method 3 uses a pair of replacement blades. The moment weight difference of the damaged blade position is compensated by non-damaged blade replacement at a diametrically opposite position. There are four methods used to correct the balance in this task. These are: \u2022 Method 1. \u2022 Method 2. \u2022 Method 3. \u2022 Method 4. The methods can be selected according to the conditions of damage seen on the LPC rotor. Method 1 Method 1 uses the trim balance weights on the 36 bolt hole flange (front blade retaining ring) to compensate the moment weight difference between the removed and installed blade. Method 4 In method 4, the distribution of all the 22 fan blades is changed. Removal and installation of all blades is necessary. When two or more blades are replaced, select the applicable method in each case if method 4 is not used. Note: Seven methods of fan blade installation procedure are given in this task. Four of the seven methods are used when balance correction is applied. The remaining three methods are used when the balance correction is not applied. (see chart below) Method 2 Method 2 uses the balance weights on the 22 bolt hole flange (front blade retaining ring) to compensate for the moment weight difference.

Background VRS 1063 is an existing AMM repair for the reattachment of LPC fan blade chocking pads, which can become detached during engine running and during removal of fan blades. Early standard blades have pads which are bonded to the fan blades using silicoset rubber compound and later standard blades have stick-on pads which use a double sided adhesive tape. The two configurations are called 'Assembly A' and 'Assembly B' in the repair. The purpose of the amendment to the repair is to include a procedure for a replacement of the stick-on pads and also to add the Uni-Directionally Profiled (UDP) blade part numbers 6A6519 for (A1) engines and 6A6521 for (A5/D5) engines.

Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) -- which is the Primary thrust control Mode. N1 Rated and Un-rated and also provides Auto Starting and Thrust Reverser control. (To be covered in detail later). \u2022 Schedules engine operation to provide maximum engine performance and fuel savings. \u2022 Provides improved engine starting (Auto Start) and transient characteristics (acceleration/deceleration). \u2022 Provides maximum engine protection and is more flexible to readily adapt to changes in engine requirements. The V2500 uses a Full Authority Digital Electronic Engine Control (FADEC). The FADEC comprises the sensors and data input, the electronic engine control unit (EEC) and the output devices, which include solenoids, fuel servo operated actuators and pneumatic servo operated devices. The FADEC also includes electrical harnesses. Engine Electronic Control The heart of the FADEC is the Engine Electronic Control (EEC) unit - shown below. The EEC is a fan case mounted unit, which is shielded and grounded as protection against EMI - mainly lightning strikes. Features \u2022 Vibration isolation mountings. \u2022 Shielded and grounded (lightning strike protection). \u2022 Size - 15.9 X 20.1 X 4.4 inches. \u2022 Weight - 41 lbs. \u2022 Two independent electronic channels. \u2022 Two independent power supplies, the EEC utilises 67.53 Watts of power from either the three phase AC from a dedicated engine mounted alternator, or 28 Volts DC from an aircraft source. \u2022 Six 'screened' pressure ports provide the required pressure inputs to both channels. \u2022 Built in handle facilitates removal and handling.

The assembled unit is sealed with a housing seal and a protective shield provides channel separation. The control assembly is separated into two modules, each containing one control channel. Each module contains two multi-layer printed circuit boards assemblies, which enable it to function independently of the other channel. Electronic Engine Control Each of the EEC channels can exercise full control of all engine functions. Control alternates between Channel A and Channel B for consecutive flights, the selection of the controlling channel being made automatically by the EEC itself. The channel not in control is nominated as the back up channel. . A mating connector provides 'Crosstalk', for partial or complete channel switching and fault isolation logic when the two modules are joined. This connector also provides for the exchange of 'crosslink data', cross wiring and hardwired discretes between the two channels. The EEC has two identical electronic circuits that are identified as Channel A and Channel B. Each channel is supplied with identical data from the aircraft and the engine. This data includes throttle position, aircraft digital data, air pressures, air temperatures, exhaust gas temperatures and rotor speeds. The EEC, to set the correct engine rating for the flight conditions uses this data. The EEC also transmits engine performance data to the aircraft. This data is used in cockpit display, thrust management and condition monitoring systems.

Purpose Then using the EEC Harness Wrench torque tighten the DEP connector to 32 lbf in. The Data Entry Plug (DEP) provides discrete data inputs to the EEC. Located on to Junction 6 of the EEC. it provides unique engine data to Channel A and B. The data transmitted by the DEP is: \u2022 EPR Modifier (Used for power setting). \u2022 Engine Rating (Selected from multiple rating options). \u2022 Engine Serial No. The DEP links the coded data inputs through the EEC by the use of shorting jumper leads which are used to select the plug pins in a unique combination. During the life of an engine, it may be necessary to change the DEP configuration, either during incorporation of Service Bulletins or after engine overhaul, when the EPR Modifier code may need to be changed. Location The data entry plug is located on the channel B side electrical connectors of the EEC. During removal/replacement of the DEP it is necessary to use an EEC harness wrench, as it is imperative that the connectors are tight. On fitment of the DEP to the EEC align the main key of the Revision 2 This is accomplished by changing the configuration of the jumper leads in accordance with the relevant instructions. Service Bulletin V2500-ENG-72-0285 contains the specific detail of the process involved for modifying the Data Entry Plug.

Each channel has its own power supply, processor, programme memory and input/output functions. The mode of operation and the selection of the channel in control is decided by the availability of input signal and output controls. \u2022 Each channel normally uses its own input signals but each channel can also use input signals from the other channel required i.e. if it recognises faulty, or suspect, inputs. \u2022 An output fault in one channel will cause switchover to control from the other channel. \u2022 In the event of faults in both channels a pre-determined hierarchy decides which channel is more capable of control and utilises that channel. \u2022 In the event of loss of either channels, or loss of electrical power, the systems are designed to go to the fail safe positions.

Dedicated Alternator During engine starts 28V DC is supplied from the aircraft bus bars until the dedicated alternator comes 'on line' at approximately 10% N2. The permanent magnet alternator has two independent sets of stator windings that supply two independent, 3 phase frequency AC outputs to the EEC. These unregulated AC supplies are rectified to 28 volts DC within the EEC Switching between the aircraft 28V supply and dedicated alternator power supplies is done automatically by the EEC so in the event of a total failure of the dedicated alternator the EEC is supplied from the aircraft 28V DC bus bars, The Dedicated Alternator also supplies N2 signals for the EEC. This is provided by the frequency of a single phase winding in the stator housing as the 'primary' speed signal used by both Channels of the EEC and for the Flight Deck instrument display of engine actual speed. Should this signal fail, there is a 'Back-up' signal which is derived from one of the three phase windings of Channel 'B' power generation. There is no speed signal generation provided by the output of the coil windings of the Dedicated Alternator Channel 'A' power supply. The EEC also utilises aircraft power to operate some engine systems: \u2022 115 volts AC 400 Hz power is required for the ignition system and inlet probe anti-icing heater. \u2022 28V DC is required for some specific functions, which include the thrust reverser, fuel on/off and ground Revision 2 Page 5-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Electronic Engine Control EEC POWER GENERATION Revision 2 Page 5-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Electronic Engine Control Dedicated Alternator Cooling Shroud Location It is important that the cooling shroud is orientated correctly for the differing variant engines. The shroud must be clamped with the arrow on the shroud aligned with the number '1' indicated position for A5 and A1 applications. For D5 applications only the arrow on the clamp must align with the number '2' indicated position. With the arrow aligned make sure that the dowel on the shroud engages in the adjacent cooling hole on the casing, this correctly aligns the cooling air inlet on the shroud with the cooling hole in the casing. Tighten the nut on the shroud to hold the shroud firmly in the correct position. Torque the nut on the alternator shroud to 180 -- 220 lbfin (20 -- 25 Nm) Connect the tube to the alternator shroud and torque tighten the tube nut to 283 -- 310 lbfin (32 -- 35 Nm) Safety the tube with locking wire. Connect the electrical connectors and torque them to 16 lbfin (1,8 Nm) If this is not carried out, the cooling airflow may not be able to enter the stator housing due to the cooling air hole on the stator being masked by the clamp body of the cooling shroud. The diagram below shows both arrangements and their relevant application.

Location The aircraft throttle is located in the flight deck. This is in reference to the TLA resolvers. The EEC is engine intermediate case mounted. This is in reference to the TRA signal that is derived from TLA. Description The throttle control lever (Thrust Lever) is based on the \"fixed throttle\" concept; there is no motorised movement of the throttle levers. Each throttle control lever drives dual throttle resolvers; each resolver output is dedicated to one EEC channel. The throttle lever angle (TLA) is the input to the resolver. The resolver output, which is fed to the EEC, is known as the Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA). The relationship between the throttle lever angle and the throttle resolver angle is linear therefore: 1 deg TLA = 1.9 deg TRA Revision 2 Page 6 - 1 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 2 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Throttle Control Lever Mechanism The throttle control mechanism for one engine is shown below. The control system consists of: \u2022 The throttle control lever. \u2022 The mechanical box. \u2022 The throttle control unit. The throttle control lever movement is transmitted through a rod to the mechanical box. The mechanical box incorporates 'soft' detents, which provides selected engine ratings, it also provides \"artificial feel\" for the throttle control system. A second rod to the throttle control unit transmits the output from the mechanical box. The throttle control unit incorporates two resolvers and six potentiometers. Each resolver is dedicated to one EEC channel; the output from the potentiometers provides T.L.A. signals to the aircraft flight management computers. A rig pin position is provided on the throttle control unit for rigging the resolvers and potentiometers. Revision 2 Page 6 - 3 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 4 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Bump Rating Push Button (A1 Engined Aircraft only) In some cases (optional) the throttle control levers are provided with \"Bump\" rating push buttons, one per engine. This enables the EEC to be re-rated to provide additional thrust capability for use during specific aircraft operations. Note: Bump Ratings can be selected, regardless of TLA only in EPR mode when aircraft is on ground. Bump Ratings can be de-selected at any time by actuating the bump rating push button, as long as the aircraft is on the ground and the Thrust Lever is not in the Max Take-Off detent. In flight, the bump ratings are fully removed when the Thrust Lever is moved from the Take-Off detent to or below the Max Continuous detent. The Bump Rating is available in flight (EPR or N1 mode) under the following conditions: \u2022 Bump Rating is initially selected on ground. \u2022 Take-Off, Go Around TOGA Thrust position set. \u2022 Aircraft is within the Take-Off envelope. When Bump Rating is selected a 'B' appears next to the associated EPR display. Use of Bump must be recorded. Flexible Takeoff (A1 & A5 Engine Aircraft) Definition of Flexible Takeoff: In many instances, the aircraft takes off with a weight lower than the maximum permissible takeoff weight. When this happens, it can meet the required performance with a decreased thrust that is adapted to the weight: This is called 'Flexible Takeoff' and the thrust is called 'Flexible Takeoff Thrust'. The use of Flexible Takeoff Thrust saves engine life. The maximum permissible takeoff weight decreases as temperature increases, so it is possible to assume a temperature at which the actual takeoff weight would be the limiting one. This temperature is called 'Flexible Temperature' or 'Assumed Temperature' and is entered into the FADEC via the MCDU PERF TO page in order to get the adapted thrust. Note! If the thrust 'Bump' is armed for takeoff and flexible thrust is used, the pilot must use the Takeoff Performance determined for the non-increased takeoff thrust (without Bump). \u2022 Thrust must not be reduced by more than 25% of the full rated thrust. When one Bump button is selected, both engines will be at the \"Bump Rated\" value. Pressing Bump again deselects Bump Rating.

An intermediate retractable mechanical stop is provided at 0 degrees. Thrust rating limit is computed according to the thrust lever position. If the thrust lever is set in a detent the FADEC will select the rating limit corresponding to this detent. Forward Thrust Range The forward thrust range is from 0 degrees to plus 45 degrees. \u2022 0 degrees = forward idle power. \u2022 45 degrees = rated take off power. If the thrust lever is set between two detents the FADEC will select the rating limit corresponding to the higher mode. Two detents are provided in this range: \u2022 Max climb (MCLB) at 25 degrees. \u2022 Max continuous (MCT)/flexible (de-rated) take off power (FLTO) at 35 degrees. Reverse Thrust Range Lifting the reverse latching lever allows the throttle to operate in the range 0 degrees to minus 20 degrees. A detent at minus 6 degrees corresponds to thrust reverse deploy commanded and reverse idle power, minus 20 degrees is max reverse power. Auto Thrust System (ATS) The Auto Thrust System can only be engaged between 0 degrees and plus 35 degrees. Two engine operation 0 degrees and Max Climb 25 degrees. One engine operation 0 degrees and Max Cont 35 degrees.

The EEC will convert this signal into a fuel flow error in order to change the fuel flow for a power level change. Description Movement of the pilots throttle control lever is sensed by the dual resolvers, which signal the TRA to the EEC. The EEC computes the fuel flow, which will produce the required thrust. The computed fuel flow request is converted to an electrical current (I) which drives the torque motor in the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) which modulates fuel servo pressure to move the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) and sets the fuel flow. A dual resolver senses movement of the FMV, which is located in the fuel metering unit next to the FMV. The dual resolver translates the fuel metering valve movement into an electrical feedback signal that is fed back to the EEC. Revision 2 Page 6 - 9 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 10 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Basic Control Loop N1 Reversion The EEC uses closed loop control based on Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) or, N1 if EPR is unobtainable. In case of no EPR (either sensed or computed) available, an automatic reversion to N1 mode is provided. EPR Closed Loop Control The EEC computes a Target EPR as a function of: \u2022 TRA (Throttle Resolver Angle). \u2022 T amb (Ambient temperature). \u2022 T2 (Engine air inlet temperature). \u2022 Alt (Altitude). \u2022 Mn (Mach Number). The EPR target is compared to the actual EPR to determine the EPR error. The EPR error is converted to a rate controlled fuel flow command (WF), which is summed with the measured fuel flow (WF actual) to produce the WF error. The W.F. error is converted to a current (I), which is sent to the FMU to drive the torque motor; this moves the FMV to change the fuel flow. The change in fuel flow causes the engine to accelerate/decelerate and brings about a change in actual EPR. This process continues until there is no EPR error. Note: The EEC controls the rate of change of fuel flow, and thus acceleration/deceleration times, as a function of the rate of change of HP Compressor Speed (N2).

N1 Reversion At the reversion to N1 mode (rated or unrated) an equivalent thrust to that achieved in EPR mode is provided until a thrust lever position change. Note: Autothrust control is lost. Rated N1 Mode An automatic reversion to rated N1 mode occurs if sensed EPR. (Either P2 or P4.9) or any of the computed EPR parameters are not available. A manual selection of N1 mode on the push buttons on the overhead panel selects rated N1 mode. (Note! The pilot is instructed to select N1 rated thrust on both engines). The N1 mode indication is displayed in blue on the upper ECAM. Also displayed, is the N1 rating limit corresponding to the thrust lever position. Note: This is not displayed in unrated N1 mode. Revision 2 Page 6 - 13 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 14 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Unrated N1 Mode Alternate Engine Control N1 Reversion At the reversion to N1 mode (rated or unrated) an equivalent thrust to that achieved in EPR mode is provided until a thrust lever position change. With both engines now selected to N1 rated thrust control, they will now be controlled to provide the required thrust levels dictated by thrust lever physical position. As N1 mode is selected on both engines, the EPR indication of both engines is not available on the upper ECAM screen. Revision 2 If in addition to losing EPR parameters either T2 or Altitude data is lost, then the EEC automatically reverts to unrated N1 thrust setting. The unrated N1 thrust setting requires the thrust to be set manually to an N1 speed. An over boost situation can occur in this mode at the full forward thrust lever position. The N1 mode indication previously displayed in blue on the upper ECAM is no longer displayed in unrated N1 mode. Note: This mode is a 'non-dispatchable mode'.

Entering, exiting these three modes is controlled by inputs to the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) Auto Thrust Mode The auto thrust mode is only available between idle and MCT when the aircraft is in flight. After take off the throttle is pulled back to the max climb position, the auto-thrust system will be active and the Automatic Flight system will provide an EPR target to provide either: - \u2022 Auto thrust is disconnected by the EIU. In the 'Memo' mode the thrust is 'frozen', to the last actual EPR value and will remain frozen until the throttle lever is moved manually, or, auto thrust is reset. Manual Thrust Mode This mode is entered anytime the conditions for AUTO or MEMO are not present. In this mode thrust is a function of throttle lever position. \u2022 Max climb thrust. \u2022 An optimum thrust. \u2022 A minimum thrust. \u2022 An aircraft speed (Mach number) in association with the autopilot.

The thrust level that 'Alpha Floor Protection' provides is that equivalent to maximum EPR level at TOGA. Note: The conditions requiring 'Alpha Floor Protection' to be invoked are extremely rare, due to the circumstances which require its operation Revision 2 Page 6 - 19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Thrust Modes Manual Mode After Takeoff The engines are in the manual mode provided the A/THR function is: \u2212 The pilot can change from the FLX to MCT by moving the thrust lever to the Take Off Go Around (TOGA) or Climb (CL) detent, then back to MCT. After that, they cannot use the FLX rating. \u2022 Not armed or \u2022 Armed and not active (Thrust lever not in the operating range and no alpha floor). In these conditions each engine is controlled by position of its thrust lever. The pilot controls thrust by moving the thrust lever between IDLE and TOGA positions. Each position of the thrust lever within these limits corresponds to an EPR. Note! Setting the thrust lever out of the FLX/MCT detent without reaching the TOGA or CL detent has no effect. The pilot can always demand Maximum Take Off thrust by pushing the thrust lever all the way forward, to the TOGA position. When the thrust lever is in a detent, the corresponding EPR is equal to the EPR rating limit computed for that engine. When the thrust lever is in the FLX/MCT detent On the ground \u2212 The engine runs at the Flex takeoff thrust rating if the crew has selected a flex takeoff temperature on the MCDU that is higher than the current Total Air Temperature (TAT). Otherwise the engine produces Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) Note! A change in FLEX TEMP during the takeoff has no effect on the thrust.

The primary purpose of the fuel system is to provide a completely controlled continuous fuel supply in a form suitable for combustion, to the combustion system. The LP pump boosts the initial fuel delivery to a pressure so as to prevent low pressure entry into the HP pump. Nominal pressure 150psi. Description The fuel flows into the fuel oil heat exchangers for the engine and IDG. Control of the fuel supply is by the EEC via the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU). High pressure fuel is also used to provide servo pressure (actuator muscle) for the following actuators; \u2022 BSBV actuators. \u2022 VSV actuator. \u2022 ACC actuator. \u2022 ACOC actuator. The major components of the fuel system include; \u2022 High and low pressure fuel pumps (dual unit). \u2022 Fuel/oil heat exchanger. \u2022 Fuel filter. \u2022 Fuel metering unit (FMU). \u2022 Fuel distribution valve. \u2022 Fuel injectors (20). \u2022 Fuel diverter and back to tank valve (FDRV). The fuel system controls are on the centre control pedestal and the indications are in the form of an annunciator light and ECAM messages. Revision 2 Depending on the mode of operation the heat management system is in depends on which direction the fuel will flow. From the engine FCOC the fuel passes through the LP fuel filter. The filter has a 40 micron filtration capability. The fuel is received by the HP pump and is boosted to a nominal 1000 psi. The HP pump has pressure relief set at 1360 psi. The FMU meters the fuel and the excessive HP fuel is diverted back into the LP supply. The FMU is controlled by signals from the EEC. The fuel flow meter gives indication to the upper ECAM screen of real time fuel flow in KG/H. The distribution valve filters the fuel and splits the supply into ten separate outlets. The ten outlets supply fuel to two fuel spray nozzles per outlet. The fuel spray nozzles have small filters within them. This gives last chance filtration prior to fuel atomisation.

This Service Bulletin covers the fitment to engines of a FCOC incorporating design changes to prevent fuel leakage. Location The LP fuel filter is located in the LP fuel filter housing that is integral with the fuel and oil heat exchanger. Description The LP fuel filter is a woven, glass fibre, disposable, 40 micron (nominal) type. The LP fuel filter and housing have the following features; \u2022 A differential pressure switch, which generates a flight deck message, FUEL FILTER CLOG, if the differential pressure across the filter, reaches 5 psi. \u2022 A by-pass valve which opens and allows fuel to bypass the filter if the differential pressure reaches 15 psi. \u2022 A fuel drain plug, used to drain filter case or to obtain fuel samples. \u2022 Fuel temperature sensor.

They are; \u2022 Fuel metering to the combustion chamber. \u2022 Control of the opening and closing off of the fuel supply to the combustion chamber. \u2022 Overspeed protection. Location Excessive HP fuel supplies that are not required, other than that for actuator control and metered fuel to the combustor, is returned to the LP system via the spill valve. In addition to the fuel metering function the FMU also houses the overspeed valve and the pressure raising and shut off valve. The FMU is mounted on the combined fuel pumps assembly. The overspeed valve under the control of the EEC provides overspeed protection for the LP (N1) and HP (N2) rotors. The combined fuel pumps assembly is located on the rear face of the high-speed gearbox, left hand side. The pressure raising and shut off valve provides a means of isolating the fuel supplies to start and stop the engine. Description Note: The FMU is the interface between the EEC and the fuel system. There are no mechanical inputs to, or outputs from, the All the fuel delivered by the HP fuel pumps, which is more than the engine requires is passed to the FMU. The FMU, under the control of the EEC, meters the fuel supply to the fuel spray nozzles. The HP fuel pressure also provides a servo operation (muscle) for the following actuators; \u2022 Booster stage bleed valve (BSBV) actuators. \u2022 Variable stator vane (VSV) actuator. \u2022 Active clearance control (ACC) actuator. \u2022 Air cooled oil cooler (ACOC) actuator.

The three main functions of the FMU are; \u2022 Metering the fuel supplies to the fuel spray nozzles. \u2022 Overspeed protection for both the LP (N1) and HP (2) rotors. \u2022 Isolation of fuel supplied for starting/stopping the engine. Three valves arranged as follows carry out these three functions; \u2022 The Fuel Metering Valve. \u2022 The Overspeed Valve. \u2022 The Pressure Raising and Shut Off Valve (PRSOV). Fuel metering valve The fuel metering valve varies the fuel flow according to the EEC command. The positional feedback to the EEC is by a rotary variable displacement transducer (RVDT). The overspeed valve The overspeed valve protects the engine against an exceedance of; \u2022 N1 shaft speed. \u2022 N2 shaft speed. Revision 2 The feedback to the EEC of the valve operation is by a micro switch. The pressure raising and shut of valve (PRSOV) The PRSOV is an open and close type valve. The PRSOV controls the fuel to the combustor. When the valve is in the pressure raising state it is said to be open. When the valve is in the shut off state it is said to be closed. Note: The EEC has command to open the PRSOV upon an engine start. The EEC has command to close the PRSOV in auto start mode and when the N2 is below 50%. Above 50% N2 the close command is from the master lever in the flight deck only. Pressure drop governor and spill valve The pressure drop governor controls the pressure difference across the FMV. The spill valve is controlled by the pressure drop governor. The spill valve is designed to vary the excessive HP fuel pressure return to the LP system. Page 7-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Fuel System Page 7-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Fuel System Fuel System Operation Fuel metering Valve Operation Fuel metering is achieved by the Fuel Metering Valve and the Pressure Drop Regulator and Spill Valve, which act together in the following sequence: Signals from the EEC cause the torque motor to change position, which directs fuel servo pressure to re-position the Fuel Metering Valve. This changes the size of the metering orifice through which the fuel passes which in turn changes the pressure drop across the metering valve. The change in the pressure drop is sensed by the Pressure Drop Regulator which will re-position the spill valve and so increase/decrease the fuel flow through the fuel metering valve until the pressure drop is restored to its datum value. The increase/decrease in fuel flow causes the engine to accelerate/decelerate until the actual EPR is that demanded by the EEC signal. Movement of the Fuel Metering Valve is transmitted through a rack and pinion mechanism to drive a dual output position resolver. The resolver output is fed back to the EEC. The EEC automatically corrects changes in fuel density. Bimetallic washers located in the pressure drop governor and spill valve assembly provide automatic compensation for changes in fuel temperature. Revision 2 Page 7-21 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Fuel System Page 7-22 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Fuel System Fuel System Operation Note: FMU 'Emergency' Overspeed Protection Because of the fact that the overspeed valve is spring loaded to the closed position, and opened by fuel pressure, the overspeed valve will close every time the engine is shut down. The Overspeed Valve is positioned down stream, in series, with the Fuel Metering Valve. Note: It should be understood that this device is not incorporated to provide the usual N1/N2 red line limiting of max TO speed of 100%. The PRSOV will remain open due to the small amount of fuel that is allowed to flow by the shutoff vale The microswitch gives valve positional feedback to the EEC. The EEC will act through the Fuel Metering Valve to trim the fuel flow if N1 or N2 reach 100%. Operation The overspeed valve is spring loaded to the closed position, it is opened by increasing fuel pressure during engine start and during normal engine operation is always fully open. In the event of an overspeed condition (>109% N1 or >105.7% N2 ) the EEC sends a signal to the overspeed valve torque motor which changes position and directs HP fuel to the top of the overspeed valve thus fully closing the valve. A small by-pass flow is arranged around the overspeed valve to prevent engine flame out. The overspeed valve is hydraulically latched in the closed position, thus preventing the engine from being accelerated. The recommended procedure is for the flight crew to close the engine down, and not re-start. Closing down the engine is the only way to release the hydraulic latching.

The EEC's ability to close the shut off valve is inhibited above 50% N2. Its primary function is to isolate the fuel supplies to the fuel spray nozzles for starting and stopping the engine. Above 50% N2, and in flight, the PRSOV can only be closed by the crew operated switch in the flight deck. It acts as a pressure raising valve to ensure that, during engine starts, fuel is not passed to the fuel spray nozzles until fuel pressures in the FMU are high enough to ensure the control devices will function correctly. The microswitch gives valve positional feedback. The two position torque motor, which controls HP fuel pressure to operate the PRSOV also, controls a spill valve servo line. When the torque motor is selected to close the PRSOV, to shut down the engine, the spill valve servo line is opened. This will fully open the spill valve and direct all the HP fuel pump delivery back to the LP fuel system. The PRSOV torque motor is commanded open by the EEC during AUTO starts. It is commanded open by the engine master switch during a MANUAL start. The PRSOV can be commanded closed by the EEC during an AUTO start, if the EEC detects a fault in the start cycle.

The scavenge system is designed to retrieve the oil that is present in the bearing chambers and gearbox for cooling and recirculation. Description There are six scavenge pumps that are designed to suck the oil and pass it through: Oil cooling is controlled by a dedicated Heat Management System which ensure that engine oil, IDG oil and fuel temperatures are maintained at acceptable levels while ensuring the optimum cooling configuration for the best engine performance. The engine oil system can be divided into three sections. These sections are: \u2022 Pressure feed. \u2022 Scavenge. \u2022 Venting. Pressure feed The pressure feed system uses the full flow generated by the pressure pump. The pressure pump moves the oil through: \u2022 The pressure filter. \u2022 Fuel oil heat exchanger. The oil is then distributed to the engine bearings and gear drives. Revision 2 \u2022 Magnetic chip detectors. \u2022 A scavenge filter and master chip detector. Prior to returning the oil back to the oil tank. Venting The venting system is designed to allow the air and oil mix that develops in the bearing chambers and gearbox to escape to the de oiler. No.4 bearing does not have a scavenge pump. It relies upon the build up of air pressure in the bearing chamber to force the air and oil through the no.4 bearing scavenge valve and into the de oiler. Indications There are flight deck indications that allow the oil system to be monitored. There are also messages generated ECAM for further flight crew awareness.

Location Mounted to the rear of the oil tank. Description The scavenge filter has the following features; \u2022 The filter is a disposable mesh type filter with a nominal 30 micron filtration capability. \u2022 A differential pressure switch monitors the flow through the filter for of blockage by contamination. \u2022 A by pass valve, which opens when the filter flow is restricted due to contamination. \u2022 The master magnetic chip detector housing is located on the filter housing. Revision 2 Page 8-25 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Engine Oil System Page 8-26 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Engine Oil System No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve Purpose High flow Maintains the centre bearing compartment (No 4 bearing) seal deferential pressure by controlling the venting of the compartment air/oil mixture to the de oiler. When the engine is at low power the valve is at the high flow position. Location Therefore the valve is fully open and the pressure differential is maintained across the carbon seal. The no.4 bearing scavenge valve is located on the front of the de oiler, which is located on the front face of the external gearbox. Low flow Description The no.4 bearing scavenge valve has the following features; Therefore the valve is at the restricted flow condition and the pressure differential is maintained across the carbon seal. \u2022 Operational feed back signal to EIU. Note: \u2022 Uses HPC10 air as the servo air for the valve operation. High flow at high power will cause a lower seal differential pressure. This will lead to the flow of buffer air across the carbon seal to increase. \u2022 Stage 10 air less than 150 psi the valve is at maximum open position. \u2022 Stage 10 air more than 200 psi the valve is at minimum open position. \u2022 Feedback to EIU of valve operation is the valve position indicator; scavenge oil pressure sensor and Pb indication from the EEC. When the engine is at high power the valve is at the low flow position. The increase flow of buffer air leads to the carbon seal drying out. If the valve is not in the correct position for the engine power setting, the warning message \"BEARING 4 OIL SYS\" on the upper ECAM. The no.4 bearing scavenge valve controls the flow of the scavenge oil and vent air by varying the size of the orifice of the valve. This allows the scavenge oil and vent air to enter the de oiler under controlled conditions.

The debris must be examined with a binocular microscope of 20 times magnification. If the engine or external gearbox is rejected, the debris from the MCD's and filters must be sent with the component to the overhaul shop. Metallic Flakes Metallic flakes come from these components: ball bearings, roller bearings and gear teeth. Flakes that have an irregular shape must be examined to find their origin. \u2022 Ball bearing and ball bearing track flakes are usually almost circular with radial cracks. When the flake is clean, the shiny side is much brighter than other types of flake. The shiny side also has small scratches that go across each other. \u2022 This is unwanted material that is accidentally left in the engine when it is assembled. The build debris comes from machining operations when the components are manufactured. When the material is broken it can look the same as gear or steel seal material. Roller bearing and roller bearing track flakes are usually almost rectangular in shape. When the flake is clean, the shiny side is much brighter than other types of flake. The shiny side has small scratches that go across each other. \u2022 Gear teeth flakes are shiny with an irregular shape. They are usually thicker and not as bright as ball or roller bearing flakes. Magnetic Fines Chips These are very small steel particles, which show as a black sludge on the MCD's. When the oil is removed they show as dull hair like slivers. Fines come from permitted engine wear. Bearing skid can also make fines, but the increased quantity will show during the analysis of MCD samples. These are very thick flakes or pieces of metal, which usually have one smooth machined surface. There are four main types of debris found on MCD's and in filters. They are build debris, magnetic fines, metallic flakes and chips and gear tooth fragments. Build Debris Revision 2 Gear Tooth Fragments These are the corner pieces of gear teeth and may show that the gears are not correctly aligned.

Command signals of the EEC control the two valves. The two valves in turn manage the flow of high pressure fuel. This is done to optimise the heat exchange process that takes place between the fuel and oil. Location The unit is bolted to the rear of the fuel/oil heat exchanger. Description Fuel Diverter Valve This valve is a two position valve and is operated by a dual coil solenoid. The control signals to energise/de-energise the solenoid come from the EEC \u2022 Solenoid energised - mode 1 or 3. \u2022 Solenoid de-energised (fail safe position) mode 4 or 5. Back to Tank Valve This valve is a modulating valve and will divert a proportion of the LP fuel back to the aircraft tanks as controlled by the EEC. The interface between the EEC and the valve is a modulating torque motor; the torque motor will direct HP servo fuel to position the valve. \u2022 Fail safe position is with the valve fully closed - no fuel return to tank.

The variable vanes control the angle at which the air enters the first five stages of the H.P. compressor. The actuator incorporates an LVDT which signals actuator positional information back to the EEC. The angle varies with the H.P. compressor speed (N2); this reduces the risk of blade stall and compressor surge. The five stages of variable incidence stators comprise inlet guide vanes to stage 3 and stages 3, 4, 5 and 6 stator vanes. Mechanical Arrangement Each vane has pivots at its inner and outer ends, which allow the vane to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The outer end of each vane is formed into a shaft which passes through the compressor case and is attached by a short lever to a 'unison ring', (one unison ring for each stage). Short rods to a crankshaft connect the five unison rings. A short rod to an actuator that utilises H.P. fuel as a hydraulic operating medium connects the crankshaft. Signals from the EEC direct H.P. fuel to extend/retract the actuator. Actuator movement causes the crankshaft to rotate, and, through the unison rings, reposition the variable stator vanes.

A total of four bleed valves are used, three on stage 7 and one on stage 10. The handling bleed valves are 'two position' only - fully open or fully closed, and are operated pneumatically by their respective solenoid control valve. The solenoid control valves are scheduled by the EEC as a function of N2 and T2.6 (N2 corrected). When the bleed valves are open, H.P. compressor air bleeds into the fan duct through ports in the inner barrel of the 'C' ducts. The servo air used to operate the bleed valves is H.P. compressor delivery air known as P3 or Pb. The bleed valves are arranged radially around the H.P. compressor case as shown below. Silencers are used on some bleed valves. All the bleed valves are spring loaded to the open position and as a result will always be in the correct position (open) for starting.

Steady State The valves are commanded 'open' whenever N2C26 is below the steady state closing speed. Transient The valves are commanded 'open' at the beginning of accelerations/decelerations and will 'close' when either the speed limits are exceeded or timers expire. After an acceleration phase has ceased, the valve will remain open until a period of 5 seconds have elapsed, after which it will then be signalled to close. During a deceleration phase the valve will remain open until a period of 62 seconds have elapsed after the engine has stabilised at the new engine speed. Surge/Reverse The valves will be commanded open in the event of a surge. In reverse thrust laws similar to the transient laws apply.

The operation of one bleed valve only is described. Bleed Valves The bleed valve is a two-position valve and is either fully open or fully closed. The bleed valve is spring loaded to the open position and so all the bleed valves will be in the correct position - open - for engine start. When the engine is started the bleed air will try to close the valve. The valve is kept in the open position by servo air (P3) supplied from the solenoid control valve, (solenoid de-energised) as shown below. Revision 2 Page 10-29 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Compressor Airflow Control Page 10-30 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Compressor Airflow Control Handling Bleed Valves Operation The EEC will close the bleed valves at the correct time during acceleration. The bleed valve is closed by the EEC, which energises the solenoid control valve, as shown below. Energising the solenoid control valve vents the P3 servo air from the opening chamber of the bleed valve, and the valve will move to the closed position. During an engine deceleration the reverse operation occurs and the bleed valve opens. Revision 2 Page 10-31 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Compressor Airflow Control Page 10-32 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Compressor Airflow Control Handling Bleed Valves -- Troubleshooting. The HP Compressor rotor path lining is designed to be worn away by the rotor blades of the compressor. All bleed valves (3 off stage 7, 1 off stage 10) are spring loaded to the 'open' position for engine starting. As air is expelled through the bleed valves during their normal operation, some of the debris from the rotor path lining contaminates the valve seals. They are held open during engine running, by solenoid valve directed P3 air. According to schedule requirements, the bleed valves will close progressively during the starting cycle in the sequence 7B, 10, and 7C. If this lining becomes lodged in the carbon seals within the bleed valve then there is the possibility that this will prevent the valve from operating smoothly and the valve will seize. The 7A valve stays open up to and above idle. If the valve does not operate when required, the engine will experience problems at critical points. Handling Bleed consequences: \u2022 valves failures have two major Hung Start: If the bleed valve sticks in the closed condition, (Nondetected FADEC fault) or the solenoid valve sticking in the 'energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault) the engine will experience difficulty in starting 'hung start or surge' during the start cycle. This is due to the fact that during low engine speeds, the bleed valve system is designed to effectively 'dump' into the 'C' duct a large amount of the air supplied to the HP Compressor. This is necessary because of the HP Compressor's inability to handle all the mass flow of air being supplied to it by the LP Compressor during low speed operation.

If a bleed valve fails to close when required to do so, under certain conditions the engine may exceed the recommended EGT operating limits thus preventing the aircraft from taking off. This increases the Exceedance/Overlimit. likelihood of an EGT This will be caused as a result of the EEC trying to achieve Take-off EPR but with a reduced volume of air being supplied to the combustion chamber for mixing with fuel, ignition and subsequent expansion. Additionally, an open bleed valve as a result of bleed valve system problems will also result in unexplained engine parameter shifts. Therefore the EEC makes up for the shortfall in the available volume of air and simply demands the FMU to provide more fuel to compensate. \u2022 Bleed valve(s) stuck open (Non-detected FADEC fault). \u2022 Solenoid valve sticking in the de-energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault). \u2022 An electrical failure of the solenoid valve which results in the solenoid moving to the de-energised position (FADEC fault). The resultant 'over-fuelling' provides the required EPR, but with the penalty of increased EGT. TSM Supporting data 75-00-00-301 (Bleed Valve Troubleshooting Hints) give comprehensive recommendations in the diagnosis of bleed valve related problems. Possible causes: Rigorous troubleshooting would reduce large number of NFF cases. The lubrication of bleed valves should not be carried out.

Engine Operation Impact \u2022 Bleed valves closing early can be due to the solenoid sticking such that the full de-energised position is not obtained (Non-detected FADEC fault), bleed valve internal seal wear and leakage of P3 servo air. During transient manoeuvres (acceleration/deceleration) and surge recovery, HP compressor stability is maintained by opening particular bleed valves as defined by the EEC logic. For transient manoeuvres on the ground, the 7C are opened and during flight both the 7A and 7C are opened. In both cases the 7C are opened based upon a transient detect and is closed after a set period of time has elapsed. There are no valves opened at take-off power or steady state cruise. For surge recovery, the 7A, 7C and 10 stage bleed valves are opened to maintain compressor stability. Possible causes Engine problems (stall/surge) on transient operation can be the result of: \u2022 Bleed valve(s) not being opened during the transient (acceleration/deceleration) \u2022 Bleed valve closing early. \u2022 Bleed valves not being open can be due to the bleed valve sticking in the closed position (Non-detected FADEC fault), or the solenoid sticking in the energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault).

The valve position is controlled by the EEC as a function of corrected N2 and altitude. Description Aircraft Services Air Offtake System The secondary air system is made up of the following: The engine supplies the aircraft with bleed air taken from HPC stages 7 and 10. \u2022 Active clearance control system (ACC). \u2022 10th stage make up air system. The air that is taken from the engine is used for the following: \u2022 Aircraft services bleed system. \u2022 Cabin pressurisation and conditioning. \u2022 Air cooled air cooler (ACAC) for the no.4 bearing cooling and sealing. \u2022 Wing anti icing. Active Clearance Control (ACC) The system improves engine performance by ensuring that the HPT and LPT operate with optimum turbine blade tip clearances. This is achieved by directing a controlled flow of cooling air to reduce the thermal growth of the turbine casings. This minimises the increase in turbine blade tip clearances which otherwise occurs during the climb and cruise phases. \u2022 Engine cross feed starting. \u2022 Hydraulic system pressurisation. \u2022 Water system pressurisation. The required air is bled from the HPC of each engine. Air cooled air cooler (ACAC) HPC12 air is used for cooling and sealing the no.4 bearing in the centre bearing compartment. 10th Stage Make Up Air System The ACAC pre cools the HPC12 air prior to the air being passed to the centre bearing compartment. The purpose of this system is to provide additional cooling airflow to the HPT stage 2 disc and blades. The cooled HPC12 air is commonly known as buffer air. The cooling air used is taken from the 10th stage manifold and is controlled by a two position pneumatically operated valve. Revision 2 The ACAC uses fan bypass air as the cooling medium.

This is achieved by directing a controlled flow of cooling air to reduce the thermal growth of the turbine casings. This minimises the increase in turbine blade tip clearances which otherwise occurs during the climb and cruise phases. Location The ACC system is mainly located about the core engine. The operating actuator moves in a linear motion by the influence of fuel pressure. The EEC receives feedback of the actuator position by an LVDT. The operating actuator moves a linkage that controls the valves in the modulating air control unit for the LPT and HPT case cooling. The HPT and LPT casings are cooled by fan bypass air that is ducted from the fan bypass. Failsafe Position The ACC system consists of the following items: Upon the event of fuel pressure loss and/or EEC power failure the ACC modulating air control valves will adopt the following positions; \u2022 LPT and HPT cooling manifolds. \u2022 LPT is --44% open. \u2022 Operating actuator with LVDT feedback. \u2022 HPT is closed. Description \u2022 Modulating air control valve unit. \u2022 EEC control. \u2022 Fan bypass air cooling medium. The EEC controls the ACC system by monitoring the following parameters: \u2022 Corrected N2. \u2022 Aircraft altitude. From these two parameters the EEC will signal the operating actuator.

The modulating air control valve receives ducted air from the fan bypass stream and regulates, as per ACC actuator input, the flow rate to the LPT and HPT ACC manifolds. Location Location The ACC actuator is located on the right hand side of the core engine in the 5 o'clock position. It is mounted on the compressor casing. The modulating air control valve is located on the right hand side of the core engine in the 5 o'clock position. It is mounted on the turbine casing. Description Description The ACC actuator consists of the following: The modulating air control valve has two separate valves. They are: \u2022 Linear motion two directional piston. \u2022 Dual track LVDT. \u2022 Electro hydraulic torque motor. \u2022 Filter. The ACC actuator receives signals from the EEC. The torque motor will direct high pressure fuel to one of the two sides of the piston. This is dependent on the EEC command signal. \u2022 HPT valve. \u2022 LPT valve. The two valves are designed to operate to allow the optimum airflow to the respective casings. The failsafe position is: \u2022 HPT is closed. \u2022 LPT is --44% open. Piston movement will result in a movement in the push pull rod that links the ACC actuator and the modulating air valve. The LVDT will feedback the piston position to the EEC. At engine shut down or nil servo pressure the ACC actuator will assume the failsafe position. A spring in the ACC actuator will force the piston to the failsafe position.

This is done to reduce the rotor blade tip to rotor path gap. The LPT ACC manifold is designed to impinge cooling air onto the turbine casing about the rotor blade path. This is done to reduce the rotor blade tip to rotor path gap. Location Location The HPT ACC manifold is located on the HPT casing. The LPT ACC manifold is located on the LPT casing. Description Description The assembly consists of left and right hand tube assemblies, which are a simple push fit into the manifold. The tube assemblies are sealed off at their upper ends. The assembly consists of upper and lower tube assemblies with integral manifolds; both ends of the cooling tubes are sealed. Air from the air control valve enters the manifold and is directed to the left and right tubes. Air from the air control valve enters a supply tube, which then splits to feed air into two tubes that supply the upper and lower manifolds. The manifolds direct the air into the cooling air tubes. Air outlet holes on the inner face of the tubes direct the air onto the HPT casings. Air outlet holes on the inner surfaces direct the air onto the LPT cases.

The EEC controls the opening and closing of the ACC system by monitoring input signals of; \u2022 Corrected N2. \u2022 Altitude. The EEC commands an input signal to the torque motor. The torque motor positions the jet pipe servo valve. Position A At position A the engine is shut down. This is also the failsafe position. HPT ACC valve is closed. LPT ACC valve is at --44%. The torque motor can deflect the jet pipe servo valve to bias the direction of flow of the servo fuel pressure. Position B The jet pipe servo valve controls the direction of flow of servo fuel pressure to effectively move the pilot valve. HPT ACC is closed. The pilot valve moves and admits servo fuel pressure to either side of the piston. Servo fuel pressure will act on one side of the piston at any one time when a movement is required. This position represents idling conditions. LPT ACC is closed. Position C This position represents a typical take off condition. This position is altitude dependent. The movement of the piston moves a push pull rod that in turn operates the modulating air control valve. HPT ACC is starting to open. When stabilisation of the piston is required the EEC will cancel the input signal to the torque motor. Position D and E This allows the jet pipe to return to the central position and as a result of this the pilot valve will move into the equilibrium position. Servo fuel pressure is now present on both sides of the pilot valve. The spring will bias the pilot valve position by forcing it to one side. LPT ACC is at 70%. These positions represent typically cruise and top of descent conditions. This position is altitude dependent. HPT ACC at D is 30% and at E is fully open. LPT ACC is fully open at points D and E. The dual track LVDTs will send feedback signals to the EEC of the ACC system operation.

The microswitch gives a positional feedback signal to the EEC indicating of either: Description \u2022 Valve open. The 10th stage make up air valve system consists of the following components: \u2022 Valve closed. \u2022 EEC control. The valve is open for all conditions of flight/engine operation except for cruise. \u2022 Make up valve control solenoid. In cruise the valve is closed. \u2022 Two position type on/off valve. \u2022 Microswitch positional feedback. The EEC uses input signals of: \u2022 Corrected N2. \u2022 Altitude. The EEC to signal the control solenoid to operate uses these inputs. The control solenoid manages the flow of P3 (HPC stage 12) air for the pneumatic operating medium. The two position make up air valve either opens to flow stage 10 air or closes for no flow. The solenoid is de energised when the valve is in the open position. This is the fail safe position.

The control solenoid valve purpose is to manage the flow of servo air pressure to the make up air valve. Location The control solenoid is located on the right hand side of the fan case approximately in the 4 o'clock position. th The 10 stage make up air valve is located at the top of the HPC casing. Description The 10th stage make up air valve consists of the following components: \u2022 Operating piston. \u2022 Microswitch feedback. Location Description The control solenoid consists of the following components: Solenoid pack. Pilot valve. Valve body. \u2022 Valve body. The solenoid control valve will direct the flow of servo air pressure to port when it is de-energised. The valve is a two positional type. It can either allow flow HPC stage 10 air or cut it off from the engine. There is no modulation. The solenoid control valve will direct the flow of servo air pressure to the make up valve when it is energised. The operating piston is spring loaded to the open position when servo air is not present in the piston chamber. Servo air is used to close the valve. The micro switch gives positional feedback of the piston position hence the valves condition. The fail safe position is valve open.

The make up air valve will be commanded to open during all flight conditions except during cruise. To Energise the Solenoid Valve The solenoid pack attracts the cover plate A towards it thus opening up the chamber that is at the spring side of the pilot valve. The servo air pressure and spring pressure at the spring end of the pilot valve overcomes the servo air pressure alone on the opposite side of the pilot valve. This makes the pilot valve move towards the cover plate B. Cover plate B is pushed away from the orifice allowing servo air to enter the make up valve. The servo air enters the make up valve piston chamber in the opposite side to the spring side. The servo air pressure overcomes the spring pressure and forces the piston to move and hence close the valve. The microswitch contacts are broken and a feedback signal is fed to the EEC. Revision 2 Page 11-15 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Engine Secondary Air Systems Page 11-16 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Engine Secondary Air Systems To De-Energise the Solenoid Valve The solenoid pack is de-energised. The cover plate A is force away from the solenoid pack by spring pressure and forced against the orifice. This prevents servo air from entering the spring side of the pilot valve. Servo air pressure on the opposite side of the pilot valve now forces this valve against the spring. As the pilot valve moves cover plate B closes off the orifice. This prevents servo air pressure from entering the make up valve piston chamber. The spring affecting the piston valve forces the piston to move and open the make up valve orifice. The microswitch contacts are made and a feedback signal is fed to the EEC. Fail Safe Position The fail safe position has the valve in the open position hence solenoid de-energised. This is also true if a power loss is experienced or a loss of servo air pressure.

The precooler prepares the bleed air to an acceptable temperature before it enters the environmental control system (ECS). \u2022 Wing leading edge anti icing. \u2022 Engine cross bleed starting. \u2022 Hydraulic system pressurisation. Location The bleed air offtakes are taken from: \u2022 HPC stage 7 for high power conditions. \u2022 HPC stage 10 for low power conditions. Description HPC air is taken from the engine and ducted towards the aircraft services. The pre cooler utilises fan bypass air to cool the HPC bleed air. The temperature limiting thermostat (TLT) controls the PRV when an over temperature has been experienced. The temperature controlling thermostat (TCT) controls the pre cooler valve but if bleed temperature cannot be maintained the temperature limiting thermostat will signal for the PRV to close. The bleed monitoring computer controls the functions of bleed air system making the system fully automatic. The HPC stage 7 offtake has a non return valve installed before the two offtakes join. The NRV protects against HPC stage 10 air from reverse flowing back into the HPC stage 7 of the engine. The HPC stage 10 offtake has a control valve called the high pressure valve (HPV). After the two offtakes come together as one there is a pressure regulating valve (PRV). A switch located in the flight deck controls the PRV.

Temperature controlling thermostat (TCT) The selection of HPC stage 7 (also called IP bleed air) or HPC stage 10 is automatically done by the BMC. TCT will regulate the temperature of the air entering the aircraft system to 200 +/- 15 deg.c. The TCT controls the opening/closing of the Fan air valve to regulate the fan airflow through the Pre -- cooler. High pressure valve (HPV) The HPV will regulate HPC stage 10 air to 36+/- 3 psi. The HPV will close if upstream pressure is greater than 100 +/- 5 psi and/or downstream HPC stage 7 greater than 36 +/- 3 psi. The pressure sensors feedback pressure signals to the BMC.

The ACAC uses fan bypass air as the cooling medium. The cooled HPC12 (buffer) air enters the cooling jacket of the centre bearing chamber. Location The buffer air protects the no.4 bearing from excessive heat exposure. The ACAC is located on the turbine casing. Bottom left hand side in the 5 o'clock position. Description The ACAC is a fin and tube type design. The fan bypass airflow that is utilised by the ACAC extracts heat from the HPC12 air. The HPC12 air is taken off the engine through a singular tube. The buffer air enters the bearing compartment to prevent oil loss. This also pressurises the bearing chamber to allow the oil and air mix to leave the bearing chamber and enter the de oiler. The centre bearing compartment does not have oil scavenge pump. The HPC12 air enters the ACAC and the heat exchange process takes place between the fan bypass air and the hot HPC12 air. The fan bypass air is ejected to atmosphere. The cooled HPC12 air leaves the ACAC and is distributed to the centre bearing compartment through three tubes. The tubes enter the diffuser casing in three positions. They are: \u2022 12 o'clock. \u2022 3 o'clock. \u2022 9 o'clock.

Ice build about the inlet cowl leading edge could affect engine performance and could cause engine damage from ice ingestion. The distribution manifold will allow hot air to enter the inlet cowl leading edge. The excessive air is ejected overboard via an outlet located on the right hand side of the inlet cowl. Fault indications for the ice protection system are as follows: To prevent ice formation ice protection systems have been incorporated into the engine. The flight deck anti icing selector switch illuminates. The inlet cowl leading edge is thermally ice protected. P2/T2 probe heater The P2/T2 probe mounted in the inlet cowl is thermally ice protected. The P2/T2 probe is continuously heated during engine operation by an integral 115V heating coil. The spinner of the fan module is ice protected by a flexible rubber tip. Spinner An ECAM warning message is generated. The engine ice protection system description is as follows: A solid rubber nose tip that vibrates naturally to break up and dislodge the ice immediately it starts to form protects the spinner against ice build up. Inlet cowl ice protection Ground running The inlet cowl is thermally heated to prevent ice formation at the leading edge of the intake lip. Icing conditions may occur when temperature (OAT) is less than: The ice protection system for the inlet cowl is controlled from the flight deck by a selector switch. The switch will control the opening and closing of the TAI valve. 5.5 deg.c (42 deg.f). The valve will allow the airflow taken from the HPC stage 7 to flow to the distribution manifold in the inlet cowl leading edge lip. If the above conditions exist the ice protection system must be operated as soon as the engine stabilises at low idle conditions after an engine start.

Location The anti icing valve is located on the right hand side of the fan case in the 4 o'clock position. Description The anti icing control valve has the following function: \u2022 On/off selection from the flight deck to allow the flow of warm air to the TAI manifold. The anti icing valve is made up of the following items: \u2022 Valve body. \u2022 Linear moving piston. \u2022 Control solenoid. \u2022 Air filter. \u2022 Butterfly valve. \u2022 Micro switch. \u2022 Manual override (as per MMEL requirements).

This along with spring pressure holds the butterfly valve in the closed position. \u2022 Open position. This requirement is necessary when a valve has failed. The MMEL will advise of the actions required to allow despatch of the aircraft. Valve open The control solenoid is de energised. The ball valve is no longer held by the control solenoid against the ambient vent. The ball valve moves by spring pressure against the orifice, which allows upstream air to enter area A. This now prevents air passage to area A of the piston. The air pressure now remains at piston area B only. This pressure is greater than the spring pressure alone therefor the piston moves against the spring pressure. The resultant movement opens the butterfly valve and allows HPC stage 7 air to flow towards the TAI manifold. Fail safe position The fail safe position is as follows: \u2022 Solenoid de energised. \u2022 Servo air pressure at piston area B only. \u2022 Butterfly valve in the open position.

The message is status related it therefore becomes a despatch critical message. Advice from the MMEL is required. When the anti icing system is functioning normally a caption will appear: Note: \u2022 ENG A. ICE It is advisable not to lock the TAI valve in the open position for the higher thrust engines. The caption appears on the upper ECAM lower right hand side. If the valve fails in the closed position it is advisable to avoid icing conditions. The selector switch will have the on indicator illuminating in the colour of blue. If the valve fails in the open position there will be a thrust limit penalty. If a disagreement exists between the selector switch and the microswitch output signal to the EEC a fault has been detected. The fault detection occurs when one of the following situations exists: One or both may be inoperative provided the valve has failed in the open position and the performance penalties are applied and OAT does not exceed ISA +35 deg.c. \u2022 A valve failure to open. For ER operations only one valve allowed to be failed in the closed position and providing the aircraft is not operating in icing conditions. \u2022 A valve failure to close. The fault portion of the selector switch will illuminate in the colour of amber when a disagreement exists. Th upper ECAM screen will display a WARNING and STATUS message of: \u2022 ENG 1(2) VALVE CLSD.

The manifold off-take from the engine is mounted on the core engine and works its way towards the right hand side of the fan casing. At the fan casing an anti ice valve is located. There is a connection between the fan casing manifolds and the air intake manifolds. The air intake manifolds allows the HPC stage 7 air to flow into a distribution manifold.

Hence if the phonic wheel has 60 teeth then 60 pulses represents a complete revolution of the N1 shaft. N2 System The indications are used for: The N2 indication is supplied by a dual output signal from channel B of the dedicated generator. \u2022 The ECAM CRT display. \u2022 An output goes to the channel B side of the EEC. \u2022 EEC control. \u2022 An output goes to the EVMU. A dedicated signal is used for trim balancing purposes. Location Fan Trim Balance The N1 speed sensors are located in the front bearing chamber mounted on the no.2 bearing support. The fan trim balance probe is located in the same place as the speed pulse probes. This probe supplies a dedicated signal for monitoring of LP system unbalance. The N2 speed indication is the output signals from the dedicated generator. The probe is also different from the speed probes. It cannot be utilised to give N1 speed indication. Description The pulse probe monitors a datum tooth of the phonic wheel. This tooth is in line with the no.1 fan blade. The speed indicating description is as follows: N1 System Three pulse probes supply the N1 indication. The pulse probes operate by monitoring the passage of a phonic wheel. The phonic wheel passage across the pulse probe generates an output signal relative to a percentage of a revolution.

The pole pieces span two teeth of the phonic wheel. The phonic wheel is an integral part of the fan stub-shaft and has 60 teeth. As the shaft rotates and the teeth of the phonic wheel pass the pole pieces and a voltage pulse is produced in the winding. The number of pulses produced is directly proportional to the speed of the shaft. This signal is passed to the EEC and is used to display N1 speed on the flight deck and also for the engine control circuits as required. Trim Balance Probe The signal from this probe is only used during trim balance operations and provides the phase relationship between any out of balance forces present and a datum position. The trim balance probe senses the passage of one specially modified tooth on the phonic wheel and produces one pulse per revolution.

In both cases the start sequence is initiated in the flight deck. The engine starting system provides the power which turns the HP rotor to a speed at which an engine start can occur. The engine ignition system provides the electrical spark that is required to ignite the fuel air mix in the combustor. The ignition system is used for: \u2022 Engine starting on ground and in flight. \u2022 Prevention of a flame out by providing a continuous spark during engine running when the aircraft is flying through a heavy rainstorm for example. Upon selection for engine start an electrical signal is sent to open the starting air valve. The starting air valve opens and admits an air supply into the starter motor.

The starter air valve controls the airflow from the air ducting to the starter motor. The valve is commanded from the flight deck via the EEC. The start valve basically comprises a butterfly type valve housed in a cylindrical valve body with in line flanged end connectors, an actuator, a solenoid valve and a pressure controller. Location The starter air control valve is located on the right hand side of the engine fan casing (intermediate module). Description The starter air control valve consists of the following: \u2022 Butterfly valve for airflow control. \u2022 Pneumatically operated. \u2022 Microswitch position indication for valve positional status. \u2022 Air filter to prevent valve operating mechanisms from contamination. \u2022 Failsafe position of the valve is closed. \u2022 Provision of a manual override for abnormal start attempts. Manual operation The starter air valve can be opened/closed manually using a 0.375 in square drive. Access is through a panel in the right hand side fan cowl door.

Engine shutdown With no pneumatic air supply available the valve is spring loaded to the closed position. Valve opening Air upstream of the butterfly valve is filtered and routed through an orifice in the solenoid valve. Air pressure and actuator spring pressure acting on the smaller piston then closes the butterfly valve. Any loss of air pressure will cause the butterfly valve to close under the action of the actuator spring. Air upstream of the orifice is also admitted to the smaller piston of the double acting actuator. When the solenoid is energised the ball valve opens to admit air to the larger piston whilst simultaneously closing the vent port. The air acting on the larger piston overcomes the combined force of upstream air pressure acting on the smaller piston and the actuator spring. Movement of the actuator is translated through the linkage to rotate the butterfly valve towards the open position.

The starter comprises of the following: \u2022 A single stage turbine. When the starter output drive shaft rotational speed increases above a predetermined rpm, Centrifugal force overcomes the tension of the clutch leaf springs, allowing the pawls to be pulled clear of the gear hub ratchet teeth to disengage the output drive shaft from the turbine. \u2022 A reduction gear train. \u2022 A clutch and an output drive shaft. These are all housed within a case incorporating an air inlet and exhaust. Compressed air enters the starter, impinges on the turbine blades to rotate the turbine, and leaves through the air exhaust. The reduction gear train converts the high speed, low torque rotation of the turbine to low speed, high torque rotation of the gear train hub. The ratchet teeth of the gear hub engage the pawls of the output drive shaft to transmit drive to the external gearbox, which in turn accelerates the engine HP compressor rotor assembly. When the air supply to the starter is cut off, the pawls overrun the gear train hub ratchet teeth allowing the turbine to coast to a stop. The engine HP turbine compressor assembly, the external gearbox and starter output drive shaft continue to rotate.

It also assists deceleration during an aborted takeoff. Location The thrust reverser is an integral part of the C duct assembly. The C duct assembly is mounted to the aircraft strut by four hinged brackets located at the top of the C ducts. They are held in the closed position by six latch locks located at the bottom of the C ducts. Description The reverser is a translating sleeve type system. It directs the fan air rearwards for normal forward thrust or forwards for thrust reverse. When the thrust reverser system is in the stow position the fan air exhausts at the common nozzle. This produces forward thrust. Reverse thrust is selected from the flight deck by the gated reverse thrust levers. The EEC has control over the operation of the thrust reverse system. All signals to and from the thrust reverser are through the EIU and EEC. Thrust reverser system features Electronic control. Hydraulic actuation system. Positional information feedback. Actuator lock position sensors and feedback. Electronic safety locks. Automatic restow system. Manual deployment and stow capability for maintenance. Manual lockout to allow aircraft to be despatched with an inoperative thrust reverser. When the thrust reverser is deployed four linear motion actuators cause the translating sleeves to move rearwards. This moves the blocker doors from an axial to a radial position in the C duct fan exhaust area. The blocker doors forces the fan air through the cascades in a forward direction. The cascades are exposed whenever the thrust reverser is deployed.

Thrust Reverser Assembly When the translating sleeves are in the forward thrust position the path of the fan bypass air is in the normal forward thrust. Rearward movement of the translating sleeves unveils the cascade deflectors and moves the blocker flaps from an axial to a radial position. This blocks the fan stream airflow and forces the fan efflux through the cascade deflectors. \u2022 Shut off valve that is signalled to operate from the SEC. \u2022 The thrust reverser also has a system that will return the engine thrust to idle should the thrust reverse system inadvertently deploy. \u2022 Auto restow is a system that is designed to stow the thrust reverser when an uncommanded deployment is detected. Methods of deployment Indications The thrust reverser can be deployed in one of two methods; ECAM indications for fault annunciation of the thrust reverser system status are done by use of proximity sensors, relay select status, hydraulic system pressures and LVDT feedback signals. \u2022 \u2022 Using the engine/aircraft hydraulic system. Moving the thrust reverse select levers that are mounted on the main forward levers does selection. Manual input by two maintenance purposes. hand turning points for Safety features The locking actuator sensors detect unlocked conditions and the LVDT detects transient and deployed conditions. The signals are relayed from the EEC to the EIU and then to the ECAM screens. The thrust reverse system operation is controlled by the engine electronic control (EEC). The following are EEC controlled functions of the thrust reverse system. The thrust reverse system incorporates a double lock safety system to protect against inadvertent deployment. They are; \u2022 Landing gear control unit (LGCU). \u2022 Lock sensors on the locking actuators. \u2022 EIU inhibit relays for uncommanded in-flight Revision 2 Page 15-3 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-4 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Operation Thrust reverse is selected from the flight deck by pulling up on the thrust reverse select levers. The select levers are mounted on the front side of the main thrust levers. The thrust levers have a gated feature that allows thrust operation by the throttles in one direction only. The EEC has control of the thrust reverse system operation for deploy and stow. The EIU inhibit relay controls the DCV power signal for the control solenoid from the EEC to the DCV. Deploy Pulling up on the thrust reverse lever in the flight deck will send a signal for thrust reverse select to the EEC. This will also put the main throttles in the reverse thrust quadrant. The EEC will look for the following conditions before thrust reverse will be allowed; \u2022 The EEC will check that the aircraft is on the ground by checking the LGCU signal of the aircraft computers. \u2022 The EEC will check that the engine is running by means of a N2 signal. \u2022 The EEC cannot deploy the thrust reverser until the EIU inhibit relay is active. \u2022 SEC control signal for the shut off valve. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid and the directional control valve solenoid will both be energised for a deploy condition. This will admit high pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow and deploy sides of the thrust reverse system. The lower locking actuators will unlock and the EEC will see a signal from the proximity sensor of reverser system unlocked. In the flight deck this unlocked condition is identified as an amber coloured REV caption on the EPR indicating gauge. Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System When the translating sleeves have moved to 78% of the full deploy position the amber REV indication will change to a green REV indication. When green REV is indicated the full reverse thrust power is available to the flight crew. Stow To stow the thrust reverse system the flight crew will return the throttles to the idle detent position and select levers to the down position. This will put the throttles back to the forward thrust quadrant. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid is energised and the directional control valve solenoid is de-energised for a stow condition. This leaves high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the system. As the translating sleeves move from deploy back to stow the flight deck indication will change from green to amber on the REV indication. When the thrust reverser has reached the fully stowed position the amber REV will go and the EPR gauge will return to normal indication. This will indicate that the thrust reverser is fully stowed and locked.

Controls Pulling the levers upwards will initiate the sequence of events that will deploy the reverser system. The EEC, in conjunction with the EIU, controls the deployment and stowing of the reverser system. The levers move into the thrust reverse quadrant therefor while in this position throttle movement is only possible in the thrust reverse mode. Movement towards the maximum throttle stop for thrust reverse is possible but the engine will only accelerate when the EEC has feedback of the translating sleeve status. The translating sleeve must be beyond 78% of the fully deployed position. Stowing the thrust reverser requires the latching select levers to be pushed down and the main throttles will revert back to normal forward thrust. This will also stow the reverser system. Normal indication Thrust reverser stowed and locked. REV in colour amber Thrust reverser and in transit. REV in colour green Thrust reverser deployed. unlocked Thrust reverser indications of non-normal conditions will be indicated to the ECAM screens in the form of a message. The following are the associated ECAM messages that appear to the ECAM screens; \u2022 Reverse Unlocked. \u2022 Reverser Fault. \u2022 Rev pressurised. \u2022 Rev Switch Fault. By entering the CFDS screens the faults can be interpreted to pinpoint the location. Indications The thrust reverser system indications appear on the ECAM CRTs. The EPR indication is used to display the status of the thrust reverser.

The hydraulic system comprises of the following; \u2022 Linear motion actuators. \u2022 Flex shaft. \u2022 Hydraulic control unit comprising of a HIV and DCV. Linear Motion Actuators There are four linear motion actuators per C duct set. The two upper actuators are non-locking and incorporate LVDT's for feedback to the EEC. The HIV controls the presence of high pressure hydraulic fluid in the thrust reverser system. The energising of a control solenoid valve controls this valve. For stow and deploy conditions this valve must be energised. The DCV controls the flow direction of the high pressure hydraulic fluid once it is in the thrust reverser system. \u2022 The DCV will direct the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to both the stow and deploy sides of the system for deploy conditions. \u2022 The DCV will direct the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow side of the system for stow conditions. The two lower actuators are locking they incorporate proximity sensors to give indication to the EEC of lock and unlock conditions. Flex shaft The four linear motion actuators are kept in synchronisation movement by flexible shafts that have a high torsion resistance. Hydraulic Control Unit The hydraulic control unit comprises of the following items; \u2022 Hydraulic isolation valve (HIV). \u2022 Directional control valve (DCV). Revision 2 Page 15-9 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-10 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Hydraulic Control Unit Purpose The hydraulic control unit (HCU) is designed to control the safe passage of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to the thrust reverser system. \u2022 A filter with a clog indicator that gives a visual indication of the filter condition when it becomes contaminated. Location \u2022 A bleed valve. The HCU is located between the top of the engine fan case and the aircraft strut. Access is gained by opening the left hand side fan cowl door. \u2022 Provision for locking out the valve operation for maintenance and flight. Description The HCU is a self contained LRU designed to control the flow of high pressure hydraulic fluid. The EEC and EIU has control over the HCU control solenoids. When the EEC detects a demand for thrust reverse operation both EEC and EIU will signal the HCU control solenoids. The HCU has the following features; \u2022 A hydraulic isolation valve (HIV) which controls the flow of high-pressure hydraulic fluid into the thrust reverser system. A control solenoid valve controls the HIV function. \u2022 A directional control valve (DCV) which controls the direction of flow of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to either the deploy or stow sides of the system. A control solenoid valve controls the DCV function. \u2022 A pressure switch to feedback system pressure status to the EEC. Revision 2 Page 15-11 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-12 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Hydraulic Control Unit Operation Deploy When the thrust reverser select levers are moved to the up position the EEC detects that the thrust reverser system is required. \u2022 The EEC has selection control over the HIV. \u2022 The EIU has selection control over the DCV. The HIV control solenoid will be energised. This moves a lockpin away from the pilot valve chamber orifice. High pressure hydraulic fluid enters the left hand side of the chamber and forces the pilot valve to move to the right. The pilot valve moves against a spring that exerts a pressure on the right hand side of the pilot valve. The pilot valve recess moves in line with the hydraulic fluid supply tube. This admits high pressure fluid into the thrust reverse system and initially to the stow side of the system. The pressure switch moves to the high pressure indicating position. The DCV control solenoid will be energised. This moves a lockpin away from the pilot valve chamber orifice. High pressure hydraulic fluid enters the left hand side of the chamber and forces the pilot valve to move to the right. The pilot valve moves against a spring that exerts a pressure on the right hand side of the pilot valve. The pilot valve recess moves in line with the hydraulic fluid supply tube. This admits high pressure fluid into the thrust reverse system deploy side of the system. Thrust Reverser System The restrictors in the deploy supply tube to the DCV delay the pressure build up to the deploy side so the pressure present on the stow side can push the locking actuators towards the stow. This releases the pressure acting on the tine locking mechanism. Stow To stow the thrust reverser the select levers are moved to the down position. \u2022 The EEC has selection control over the HIV. \u2022 The EIU has selection control over the DCV. The DCV control solenoid is de-energised. The pilot valve moves to the right due to spring pressure alone. This leaves high pressure hydraulic fluid present in the stow side of the system. When the thrust reverser system has fully stowed the EEC will sense this by a feedback signal coming from the unlock sensors. The EEC will then de-energise the HIV control solenoid. The control solenoid pilot valve will move to the right due to spring pressure alone and the high pressure hydraulic fluid is cut off from the thrust reverser system. HIV Deactivation The deactivating lever prevents the HIV pilot valve from moving. This prevents high pressure hydraulic fluid from entering the thrust reverser system. There is now pressure present in both the stow and deploy sides of the system.

The lower locking actuators mechanism which gives; \u2022 An acme screw thread that rotates a worm gear. \u2022 A worm wheel that rotates the flex shafts. \u2022 A manual unlocking feature for maintenance purposes. incorporate a locking \u2022 A feedback signal to the EEC of actuator locked or unlocked. \u2022 A means of preventing the translating sleeves from uncommanded movement. Location The lower locking actuators are located in the thrust reverser C duct units at the lower positions. Description The actuators in general control the movement of the translating sleeves in a linear motion. The lower actuators on either thrust reverser C duct have a locking mechanism incorporated in the design. The locking mechanism adds to the safety of the system. The lower locking actuators incorporate the following features; \u2022 Hydraulically operated linear motion actuators. \u2022 A locking mechanism called a tine lock. This can only be unlocked when hydraulic pressure is present in the system. Revision 2 Page 15-15 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-16 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Lower Locking Actuators Operation Deploy Stow The EEC will energise the HIV and DCV control solenoids which allows high pressure hydraulic fluid to be present in the thrust reverser system. This is on the stow and deploy sides. To stow the thrust reverser the high pressure fluid present on the deploy side of the system must be reduced to tank pressure and ported back to the hydraulic reservoir of the aircraft. The restrictor in the pressure feed tube to the deploy side delays the deploy pressure build up enough to allow the stow pressure to initially push the actuator piston towards the stow direction. This releases the lock pressure on the tine locking mechanism. The EEC will de-energise the DCV control solenoid and this will leave high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the system. The unlock sleeve is then pushed towards the right of the tine lock. With the locking sleeve clear of the tine lock the tine lock flexible spring type fingers are free to flex. When the locking sleeve moves a lever assembly also moves. The lever assembly is linked to the external area of the actuator. The lever has a target attached to it. \u2022 When the actuator is at stow the target is in line with the proximity sensor. \u2022 When the actuator is at deploy the target is away from the proximity sensor. The actuator will now move in the stow direction. The head end of the actuator engages into the tine lock. The locking sleeve will move into position to immobilise the tine lock by spring pressure. As the locking sleeve moves to the lock position the target on the unlock indicator moves in line with the proximity sensor. The EEC detects this and sees that the thrust reverser system is stowed. The EEC detects these conditions. High pressure fluid being present in both sides of the system forces the actuator to move towards the deploy direction. This bias of movement exists because the surface area of the deploy side of the pressure plate is greater that the surface area of the stow side.

The upper non locking actuators incorporate a linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) that feeds back translating sleeve status of translation and deployment. The actuators operate in the same manner as the locking actuators. \u2022 For deployment the high pressure hydraulic fluid is present on both sides of the system. \u2022 For stowing the high pressure hydraulic fluid is present on the stow side of the system only. The LVDT monitors the movement of the translating sleeves and feeds back the signals to the EEC. This is done to tell the EEC that the translating sleeves are in transit and when 78% of travel towards the deploy has been achieved.

This is known as the third lock of safety. For normal thrust reverser operation provides a one way directional flow for the hydraulic fluid. The shut off valve has a filter assembly installed in line with the valve. For maintenance purposes it allows the flow of hydraulic fluid easier when manual deployment and stow of the thrust reverser is required. Location Location The shut off valve is located in the aircraft strut at the front. It is behind the HCU. The manual bypass valve is located in the aircraft strut just behind the shut off valve. Description Description The shut off valve has the following features; The manual bypass non return valve allows the flow of hydraulic fluid in one direction only. Control solenoid. Two position valve assembly. Operation The shut off valve operation for opening and closing relies upon the signals from the spoilers and elevators computer (SEC). Pulling up the thrust reverse select levers will signal the SEC to open the shut off valve. There is a very hard spring loaded valve inside that is difficult to unseat when carrying out manual operations of the thrust reverser system. The bypass handle allows the valve to become unseated for maintenance operations only. Access to the bypass valve is through an access panel located on the left hand side of the aircraft strut. The SEC sends a signal to the shut off valve relay. The relay energises the solenoid and opens the shut off valve. The high pressure hydraulic fluid now flows towards the HCU. To close the shut off valve the selection of thrust reverse levers must be in the forward thrust position.

This prevents any one actuator from moving faster than the others. Location The flex shaft is located within the deploy tube system. Description The flex shaft system comprises of the following; T piece housing assembly. This allows the distribution of high pressure hydraulic fluid to both sides of the thrust reverser system. Two flexible tubes. This allows the crossover shaft to link the reverser halves together while allowing the C ducts to be opened. Two rigid tubes. These are found between the upper and lower actuators. They carry hydraulic fluid to the deploy side of the system. Three flexible shafts. These link all the actuators together. Note: The two deploy tubes have a telescopic coupling at one end to permit simple removal and installation without disturbing the actuators.

Location The cascades are located between the inner and outer translating sleeve sleeves. They are mounted on the fixed section of the C ducts. Description There are 16 cascades fitted to the thrust reverser system. The cascades are designed to direct the fan air forwards thus providing for the function of the thrust reverse system. They are designed to direct the fan air away from the ground thus reducing the risk of debris from being blown up and ingested into the engine. They are designed to direct the fan air away from the airframe thus not inducing any unnecessary stress upon the airframe itself.

Thrust Reverser System a signal from the proximity sensor of reverser system unlocked. In the flight deck this unlocked condition is identified as an amber coloured REV caption on the EPR indicating gauge. When the translating sleeves have moved to 78% of the full deploy position the amber REV indication will change to a green REV indication. When green REV is indicated the full reverse thrust power is available to the flight crew. Deploy Stow Pulling up on the thrust reverse select lever in the flight deck will send a signal for thrust reverse select to the EEC and EIU. This will also put the main throttles in the reverse thrust quadrant. To stow the thrust reverse system the flight crew will return the throttles to the idle detent position and select levers to the down position. This will put the throttles back to the forward thrust quadrant. The EEC will look for the following conditions before thrust reverse will be allowed; The DCV solenoid will be de-energised as commanded by the EEC via the EIU inhibit relay. This will leave high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the reverser system only. \u2022 The EEC will check that the aircraft is on the ground by checking the LGCU signal of the aircraft computers. \u2022 The EEC will check that the engine is running by means of a N2 signal. \u2022 The EIU will look for the signal from the throttle control unit for energising of the inhibit relay. \u2022 The SEC signal for opening the shut off valve. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid and the directional control valve solenoid will both be energised for a deploy condition. This will admit high pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow and deploy sides of the thrust reverse system. As the translating sleeves move from deploy back to stow the flight deck indication will change from green to amber on the REV indication. When the thrust reverser has reached the fully stowed position the amber REV will go and the EPR gauge will return to normal indication. This will indicate that the thrust reverser is fully stowed and locked. The lower locking actuators will unlock and the EEC sees Revision 2 Page 15-27 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-28 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Thrust Reverser Maintenance The thrust reverser system is precisely adjusted to ensure correct alignment and load sharing between the nacelle components and the engine.

In addition to the procedure for deactivation for maintenance the thrust reverser system can be locked out for flight. Thrust Reverser Deactivation for Maintenance Thrust Reverser Deactivation for Flight Warning In addition to the deactivation procedure for the HCU the translating sleeve can be secured in the stow position by inserting a lockout pin through each translating sleeve and the fixed section of the C duct assembly. Do not cause a blockage of the hydraulic control unit (HCU) return port to deactivate the HCU. If you cause a blockage of the HCU return port the thrust reverser can operate accidentally causing injury or damage. Engine components can stay hot for up to one hour after shut down.

The most common and straightforward menu selection is 'Trouble Shooting Procedures'. If the user were to select 'Trouble Shooting Manual', this would require the user to insert a known trouble shooting task reference number in order to progress. Having acquired the knowledge of various engine systems functionality and operation during this course, we are now in a position to take the course the natural step forward and discuss the all-important methodology of isolating and identifying the source of a problem. Unless a procedural task has been already identified during previous investigation activity it will not be practical to use, as its selection would be dependent knowing which system has the fault. An important tool available to the engineer is the A319/A320/A321 'Computer Assisted Aircraft Trouble Shooting' (CAATS) CD-ROM. This valuable aid provides the user with an enormous amount of detail and information. Below is a screen shot showing the opening menu options and for the purpose of these training notes we are using 'British Midland' as the 'Log on Airline'. This manual is revised and issued every three months. Upon receipt and installation of the up-dated version the previous version is automatically overwritten and the previous disc is now no longer valid or useable. The CAATS CD-ROM is password protected for each airline, as it is tailored specifically for each operator's requirements. Therefore it is essential that the user always access the procedures for their own particular airline. After inserting the correct password the user is presented with the screen shot below. Revision 2 Page 16-1 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 V2500 Maintenance Special Revision 2 Troubleshooting Page 16-2 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 V2500 Maintenance Special Troubleshooting IAE V2500 Troubleshooting Introduction continued: Upon selecting 'Trouble Shooting Procedures' the user is then presented with the screen shot (fig. 1) shown below. These are generally of a 'Class 1' level which would prevent the aircraft from being dispatched unless the problem and source of the message had been rectified. Check Minimum Equipment List (MEL). 2. ECAM STATUS (Inoperative Maintenance Status). Systems and The presence of an ECAM Status Message 'STS' is automatically displayed on the Upper ECAM Screen during Flight phase 1 (Electrical Power 'on' before first engine start) and Flight Phase 10 (When the second engine has been shut down after the flight). It is used to highlight a problem or degradation in the built in redundancy facility of the FADEC System. This feature prevents un-wanted distractions of system degradation being shown to the pilot during the flight. A fault of this nature is dispatchable and the fault can be left un-rectified for up to ten days. Fig.1 Check Minimum Equipment List (MEL) the Status Page can then be selected by pressing the STS button on the Systems Page Select Panel. This will then provide information under the 'Maintenance' heading regarding the failure, for example ENG 1(2) FADEC or ENG 1 (2) EIU. From this menu it is possible to enter into the trouble shooting process with information derived from a variety of sources: 3. 4.

CFDS FAULT MESSAGE Centralised Fault Display System (CFDS) This menu selection is one of the most common methods of entering into the Trouble Shooting process. By interpreting the information provided on the Post Flight Report (PFR) and completing the necessary data field boxes, the user can quickly locate the appropriate Trouble Shooting task for this particular systems problem. Completing the Class of Failure data can make further refinement of identifying the task. In this case we had an upper ECAM warning message, so in this example we can identify it as a 'Class 1' fault. In this example we have a problem with the Number 2 Engine's Fuel Heat Management System. This message appeared on the upper ECAM as an 'ECAM WARNING' this is a Class 1 failure and is not dispatchable. The CFDS Fault Message is the text contained under the heading 'FAILURE MESSAGES' on the Post Flight Report. Again, in this example the Failure Message that is linked to the Upper ECAM 'ENG 2 FUEL HEAT SYS' is: 'FUL DIV RET VLV/HC/EEC2' This text along with the ATA reference number: '73-13-42' and the Source: 'EIU2FAD' is copied into the text boxes as shown on (fig. 6) opposite.

The MMEL can be used as a basis for particular operators own MEL. The MEL should be used to establish dispatchability for a particular operation. The item is then either repaired or may be deferred as per the MEL or other approved means acceptable to the Administrator prior to further operation. The MEL does not include those items that are obviously required for aircraft safety, such as wings, engines etc. The MEL does not include those items that do not affect the airworthiness of the aircraft, such as galley equipment, entertainment system etc. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) Repair Intervals Note; All items, which are related to the airworthiness of the aircraft and not included in the list, are automatically required to operational for each flight. MEL Preamble The MEL is intended to permit operation with inoperative items of equipment for a period of time, until repairs can be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. In order to maintain acceptable levels of safety and reliability the MEL establishes limitations on the duration of and conditions for operation with inoperative equipment. When an item of equipment is discovered to be inoperative, it is reported by making an entry into the Aircraft Maintenance Record/Logbook as prescribed by the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Revision 2 MEL conditions and limitations do not relieve the operator from determining that the aircraft is in a condition for safe operation with items of equipment inoperative. All users of an approved MEL, must effect repairs of inoperative systems or components, deferred in accordance with the MEL, at or prior to the repair times established by the following letter designators: \u2022 Category A: To be repaired within the time interval specified in the remarks column of the operator's approved MEL. \u2022 Category B: To be repaired within three (3) consecutive calendar days (72 hours), excluding the day the malfunction occurred. \u2022 Category C: To be repaired within ten (10) consecutive calendar days), excluding the day the malfunction occurred. \u2022 Category D: To be repaired within one hundred and twenty (120) days), excluding the day the malfunction occurred.

On March 11, 1983, five of the worlds leading aerospace manufacturers signed a 30 year collaboration agreement to produce an engine for the single isle aircraft market with the best proven technology that each could provide. The five organisations were: \u2022 Pratt and Whitney -- Combustion Chamber and High Pressure Turbine. \u2022 Japanese Aero engine Corporation (JAEC) - Fan and Low Pressure Compressor. \u2022 Rolls Royce plc - United Kingdom. \u2022 \u2022 Pratt and Whitney - USA.

In December of the same year the collaboration was incorporated in Zurich, Switzerland, as IAE International Aero Engines AG, a management company established to direct the entire program for the shareholders. The headquarters for IAE were set up in East Hartford, Connecticut, USA and the V2500 turbofan engine to power the 120-180 seat aircraft was launched on January 1st 1984. Each of the shareholder companies was given the responsibility for developing and delivering one of the five engine modules. They are: Revision 2 Note: Rolls Royce have developed and introduced the wide chord fan to the V2500 engine family. The senior partners Rolls Royce and Pratt and Whitney assemble the engines at their respective plants in Derby England and Middletown Connecticut USA. IAE is responsible for the co-ordination of the manufacture and assembly of the engines. IAE is also responsible for the sales, marketing and in service support of the V2500. Note: Fiat Aviazione have since withdrawn as a risksharing partner, but still remains as a Primary Supplier. Rolls Royce now has responsibility for all external gearbox related activity. Page 1-2 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Introduction Page 1-3 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 V2500 Line and Base Maintenance IAE V2500 Engine/Airframe Applications The V2500 engine has been designated the 'V' because International Aero Engines (IAE) was originally a fivenation consortium. The 'V' is the Roman numeral for five. The 2500 numbering indicated the first engine type to be released into production. This engine was rated at 25000lbs of thrust. For ease of identification of the present and all future variants of the V2500, IAE has introduced an engine designation system. Introduction \u2022 The designation V2500-D collectively describes all applications for the Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft. \u2022 The V2500-A collectively describes all the applications for the Airbus Industries aircraft. This is irrespective of engine thrust rating. The number given after the alpha indicates the mechanical standard of the engine. For example; \u2022 \u2022 All engines possess the V2500 numbering as a generic name. \u2022 The first three characters of the full designation are V25. This will identify all the engines in the family. \u2022 The next two figures indicate the engines rated sea level takeoff thrust. \u2022 The following letter shows the aircrafts manufacturer. Note: \u2022 The last figure represents the mechanical standard of the engine. The D5 variant is now no longer in production, however the engine is still extensively overhauled and re-furbished. V2527-A5. The only engine exempt from these idents is the current service engine, which is already certified to the designated V2500-A1.

Location They are located about the fan casing. Four hinges attach each fan cowl door to the aircraft pylon. Description The doors extend rearwards from the inlet cowl to overlap leading edge of the 'C' ducts. The A320 aircraft have a strake on the inboard cowl of each engine, the right hand cowl on both engine 1 and lefthand cowl on engine 2. The A319 aircraft have strakes on both the left-hand and right hand cowls on both engines 1 and 2. Fan cowls are interchangeable between the A319 and A320 except for the strake configuration. Make sure the correct configuration is installed. The fan cowl doors are constructed from graphite skins enclosing an aluminium honeycomb inner. are secured to each other by 4 quick release and adjustable latches. Warning The fan cowl hold open struts must be in the extended position and both struts must always be used to hold the doors open. Be careful when opening the doors in winds of more than 26 knots (30 mph). The fan cowl doors must not be opened in winds of more than 52 knots (60 mph). SB V2500-NAC-71-0259 Introduces a device that holds the fan cowl doors in a partial open position when the doors are unsupported by the struts.

The purpose of the ventilation system is to provide a flow of cooling air about the engine to reduce the risk of a fire condition annunciation to the flight deck. Location The locations of the fire detection fire wires are about the fan casing and core engine. The location of the ventilation air is about the entire of the fan case and core engine. Description The engine is ventilated to provide a cooling airflow for maintaining the engine components within an acceptable operating temperature. Fire Protection and Ventilation Zone 1 ventilation Ram air enters the zone through an inlet located on the upper LH side of the air intake cowl. The air circulates through the fan compartment and exits at the exhaust located on the bottom rear centre line of the fan cowl doors. Zone 2 ventilation Metered holes within the inner barrel of the \"C\" duct allow pressurized fan air to enter the zone 2 area. Air exhausting from the active clearance control (ACC) system around the turbine area also provides ventilation air for Zone 2. Also to provide a flow of air that assists in the removal of potential combustible liquids that may be in the area. The air circulates through the core compartment and exits through the lower bifurcation of the C ducts via the thrust recovery duct. Ventilation is provided for; Ventilation during ground running \u2022 The fan case area (Zone 1). \u2022 The core engine area (Zone 2). During ground running local pockets of natural convection exist providing some ventilation of the fan case zone 1. Zones 1 and 2 are ventilated to; \u2022 Prevent accessory and component over heating. \u2022 Prevent the accumulation of flammable vapours. Revision 2 Zone 2 ventilation is provided by fan duct pressure as above, during ground running and flight.

Zone 1 and Zone 2 fire detectors function independently of each other. When the air temperature increases to a pre determined level the system provides flight deck warning. Each zone has two detector units which are mounted as a pair, each unit gives an output signal when a fire or overheat condition occurs. Location The fire detection system is located: \u2022 Routed around the high-speed external gearbox. \u2022 At BDC of the core engine nearest to the combustor diffuser case. Description The two detector units are attached to support tubes by clips. Nacelle air temperature (NAC) Zone 2 has the nacelle air temperature sensor. Indication is to the flight deck when a temperature exceedance has occurred. The V2500 utilises a Systron Donner fire detection system. It has a gas filled core and relies upon heat exposure to increase the internal gas pressure. Thus triggering sensors. When the air temperature about the fan case and/or core engine increases to a pre-determined level the system is designed to detect this and display a warning message and indications to the flight deck. The system provides flight deck warning by: \u2022 Master warning light. \u2022 Audible warning tone. \u2022 Specific ECAM fire indications. \u2022 Engine fire push button illuminates. Revision 2 Page 2-43 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Fire Protection and Ventilation Page 2-44 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Fire Protection and Ventilation Fire Detection System and Detector Units Firewire detectors The fire detection system employs detector units called firewires. Each of the firewire detector units comprises of the following; The firewires are mounted in pairs. This is necessary due to the level 3 class 1 message that they generate when a fire or overheat condition exists. \u2022 A hollow sensor tube. \u2022 A responder assembly. The fire detection system comprises of the following units; Sensor tube \u2022 The firewires send a signal to the Fire Detection Unit (FDU). The sensor tube is closed and sealed at one end and the other open end is connected to the responder. \u2022 The FDU sends a signal to the Flight Warning Computer (FWC). The tube is filled with helium gas and carries a central core of ceramic material impregnated with hydrogen. \u2022 The FWC generates the flight deck indications for a fire condition. An increase in the air temperature around the sensor tube causes the helium to expand and increase until the pressure causes the alarm switch to close. The FDU recognises this as an abnormal situation, hence fire indication will be illuminated. There is one FDU per engine. The FDU has two channels, each channel is looking at a separate fire detector loop of zones 1 and 2. Under normal conditions both firewires require to be indicating to the FDU to give a real indication to the flight deck. If a 'burn through' occurs, the pressure within the sensing tube is lost and as a result of this the integrity switch opens to give an indication to the FDU of a loop failure. If there is a single loop failure of more than 16 seconds then the remaining firewire will continue to operate. The FDU will recognise the faulty fire loop. Responder The faulty loop will be indicated to ECAM as the following message; \u2022 The normally open switch is the alarm indication. \u2022 The normally closed switch is the fault indication. ENG 1 (2) FIRE LOOP A (B) FAULT The responder has two pressure switches, one normally open and the other normally closed. If there is a double loop failure then the FDU will recognise this as a possible burn through and the fire message will be generated to the flight deck.

The compartment is sealed using air supported carbon seals, plus an oil filled (Hydraulic) seal between the H.P. and L.P. shafts. The 8th stage compressor air supports this seal. Adequate pressure drops across the seals to ensure satisfactory sealing are achieved by venting the compartment, by an external tube to the de-oiler. Gearbox Drive The HP Stubshaft, which is located axially by the Number 3 Bearing, has at it's front end a bevel drive gear which, through the 'Tower Shaft' provides the drive for the Main Accessory Gearbox. The HP Stubshaft separates from the HP Compressor Module at the 'Curvic Coupling' and remains as part of the Intermediate Module.

A Phonic Wheel is fitted to the LP Stub Shaft; this interacts with speed probes to provide LP Shaft speed signals (N1) to the Engine Electronic Control (EEC) (see section 11 -- Engine Indicating). A speed signal is also provided to the Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU), which is located in the Aircraft Avionics Compartment. The Hydraulic Seal prevents oil leakage from the compartment passing rearwards between the H.P. and L.P. shafts. The Number 3 Bearing is hydraulically damped. The outer race is supported by a series of eighteen spring rods, which allow some slight radial movement of the bearing. The bearing is centralised by rods and any radial movement is dampened by oil pressure fed to an annulus around the bearing outer race. The gearbox gear is splined onto the H.P. shaft and retained by the Number 3 Bearing Nut.

The bearing compartment is shielded from radiated heat by a heat shield and an insulating supply of relatively cool air. This supply of cooled air (called 'buffer air') is admitted to the space between the chamber and first heat shield. The buffer air is exhausted from the cooling spaces close to the upstream side of the carbon seals, creating an area of cooler air from which the sealing function is obtained. This results in an acceptable temperature of the air flowing across the face of the carbon seals into the bearing compartment. Restrictors at the outlet from the cooling passage control buffer airflow rates. The bearing compartment internal pressure level is determined by the area of the variable scavenge valve. (No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve described in the oil system). Essentially this valve acts as a variable flow restrictor in the No 4 Bearing Compartment vent line.

An air supported (Stage 8) carbon seal seals the compartment at the front end. At the rear is a simple cover plate, with an 'O' ring type seal, secured by twelve bolts. Inside the compartment sealing is achieved on the LP shaft end by a small disc type plug, with a 'spring supported jacket cup' ring seal secured by a double helix spring clip. There are no air or oil flows down the LP shaft. Separate venting is not necessary for this compartment because with only one carbon seal, the airflow induced by the scavenge pump provides the required pressure drop across the seal. The pressure supply and scavenge oil pipes are covered by an insulating heat shield material.

It is secured to the front blade-retaining ring by 24 bolts. A Fairing is attached to the front blade-retaining ring by 6 bolts. Note: Balance weights must not be placed at these 6 bolt locations on the fairing. The Nose Cone is balanced during manufacture by applying weights to its inside surface. The nose cone is un-heated. A soft rubber cone tip provides ice protection. As ice builds up on the tip, it becomes un-balanced and flexes. This causes the ice to be dislodged from the rubber tip and is then ingested by the fan before it has built up to a significant mass. The Nose Cone retaining bolt flange is faired by a titanium fairing which is secured by six bolts. The arrangement is shown below. Note: Take care when removing the Nose Cone retaining bolts. Balance weights may be fitted to some of the bolts. The position of these bolts with their respective weights must be marked before removal, so as to ensure they are refitted to the same position.

The Front Blade Retaining Ring is secured to the Fan Disk by a ring of 36 bolts. A second (outer ring) passes through the retaining ring and permits the individual securing of the Annulus Fillers by 22 bolts. Both these sets of bolts must be removed before attempting to remove the Front Blade Retaining Ring. After the removal of the 22 annulus filler securing bolts and all 36 retaining ring bolts, it is possible to remove the front blade retaining ring by the use of 6 'pusher bolts being inserted into 6 threaded holes designed specifically for this purpose. Note: The fan blades and annulus filler positions are not identified. For this reason it is important to identify and make a note of the original blade and annulus filler positions prior to their removal. When the Nose Cone is fitted, it is possible to identify the positions of blades numbers 1,2 and 3 by noting that the front blade retaining ring has etched on it's outer edge these blade number positions. These numbers are marked in a counter-clockwise direction when viewing the engine from the front. Having established the original positions of the blades it is important to number the blades and their corresponding annulus filler by using an approved marker pen (Material VS 06-69 ref 70-30-00).

Vibration limits and fan guidelines: a) trim balance vibration Vibration Limits (Steady State) \u2212 N1 (peak): 5.0 Units. \u2212 N2 (peak): 5.0 Units. 1. Engines that have vibrations within the vibration limits are acceptable. 2. Engines that have N1 peak vibrations that exceeds the above limit, troubleshoot as per Trouble Shooting Manual (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-826) or (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-827). 3. Engines that have N2 peak vibrations that exceeds the above limit, troubleshoot as per Trouble Shooting Manual (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-828) or (ref. TSM task 77-30-00-810-829). 4. A non-revenue ferry flight to a maintenance base is permissible with N1 or N2 vibration above limits, if no fault in the respective trouble shooting procedures in steps 2 and 3 above. This condition is permissible for only one engine per aircraft. Revision 2 b) Vibration guidelines \u2212 N1 (peak): 2.0 Units 1. Fan trim balance is recommended any time N1 peak vibration exceeds this 2.0 Unit guideline. Perceivable airframe vibrations generally accompany N1 vibration levels above this guideline value. Waiting until N1 peak vibration approaches or exceeds the 5.0 unit limit may require multiple fan trim balances to bring N1 vibration down to an acceptable value. Note: 5.0 units (Aircraft ECAM display) = 1.5 inches per second of displacement due to the imbalance. 2. Aircraft/Flight correlation. Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) \u2212 As stated in the FCOM, if N2 vibration during engine start exceeds limit, the start should be aborted. Subsequent starts may be initiated without maintenance action for up to three start attempts. \u2212 The above limits and guidelines are stable (steady state) and as such may not be stable, therefore the aircraft level is advisory and not a limit. Vibration above the advisory level may or may not require maintenance action, as described in the FCOM; initially depending on icing conditions or other engine parameter shifts and finally if the advisory level is confirmed at steady state conditions.

Both use data gained from the Engine Vibration Monitoring system (EVMS). Caution: The one shot method allows balancing of the fan with fewer engine ground runs required and has proved itself effective in service use. An N1 Keep-Out-Zone (KOZ) of 61-74% N1 (AOW1056) has been introduced during all stages of engine operation on the ground, including Ground Testing, Taxiing and 'Hold' periods. This is to prevent the blade from experiencing high stresses as a result of 'Fan Blade flutter'. This is particularly acute during 'cross-wind' conditions. The KOZ is being incorporated into EEC software (availability A5 SCN17-3rd Qtr 2002) If necessary a Vibration survey (Test No 8) may be performed to obtain the vibration characteristics of the engine. Note: \u2022 If vibration exceeds limits during the survey ground run, slowly bring engine speed to idle and shutdown. \u2022 Angles are counter clockwise viewed from the front of the engine. Data: (speed, amplitude and phase angle) may be collected on ground or during cruise flight, collection in flight is either automatic or for selected speeds and on the ground may be manually selected ref: AMM. Operate both engines for this test with the non-test engine set at 1.25 EPR for aircraft stability. Engine speed greater than 85% N1 (4645 rpm) can cause aircraft buffeting. For cruise flight, data at 5 speeds, pre-selected or automatically is collected. Data stored in the memory of the EVMU is accessed through the MCDU menu in the flight deck and should be printed for later reference and calculation. Best results are obtained from data in the 80-90% N1 speed range with 85% N1 being the best single speed point, for ground running an average of correction.

LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Acquire in flight, read on ground) or Task 77-32-34-869010 (Acquisition of unbalance data on ground). Some aircraft are fitted with software (customer option) which permits the engineer to interrogate via the MCDU the stored data regarding out of balance correction required. This information is contained in the EVMU and by accessing the EVMU Engine Unbalance menu, it is possible to establish the necessary adjustments required to eliminate out of balance situations. Note: \u2022 Phase Angle (A) indicated angle in degrees from the EVMU system. \u2022 Phase Lag (B) dynamic phase lag of the LP system between phase angle and true position of unbalance. Prior to carrying out any adjustments, the engineer must first confirm the accuracy of the current status regarding the configuration of weights (position and part number) that are already installed and recorded in the system. Mass Coefficient (K) value by which the amplitude must be multiplied to give correction mass required or a given speed To accomplish this it is necessary to physically verify the position and part number of the balance weights already installed onto the front blade-retaining ring. Fan Trim Balance with the EVMU (One Shot Method) Task (77-32-34-750-010) This procedure can be used for consecutive fan trim balances if necessary. If consecutive fan trim balances with this method do not give significant results, carryout a fan trim balance with the 'Trial Weight' method.

The blade to be removed can than be pulled forward to clear the dovetail slot in the fan disc. Examine the outer surface of the Annulus Filler for cracks, nicks, dents and scores. Limits in the AMM can be applied to assess the damage for accept or reject. If the surface coating of the annulus filler is damaged to the point of requiring a repair the AMM has a procedure that allows this to be done. AMM ref 72-31-11-300-010 gives comprehensive instructions as to the correct procedure for repair.

If the Annulus Filler is not correctly installed, it is possible that when the Front Retaining Ring is subsequently torque tightened in place onto the Fan Disk, it may result in the deformation and displacement of the Rear Retaining Ring. This could cause it to come into contact with the inlet housing of LP Compressor Module.

If this were to be left uncorrected, it is possible that the Fan Blade would be displaced slightly prevented from it's normal radial operating position. \u2022 Note: If this is difficult to do, it can be an indication that the seal is caught. \u2022 Slide the plastic strip forward to move the seal into the correct position. Accomplish this procedure on both sides of the Fan Blade starting at the trailing edge of the blade and moving it forward to the leading edge. \u2022 Note: When the seal is in the correct position you can easily move the plastic strip from the front to the rear of the blade. This in turn would cause the Fan Module to become unbalanced and vibration levels for the engine could be exceeded. The task referenced above documents the procedure to eliminate this. The task requires a stiff plastic strip to be used to reposition the seals if they ' rolled' as shown in the diagram below. Note: An expired credit card is suitable, or a plastic checklist card Caution: Make sure the plastic strip has a smooth surface and edges. If you use a strip with a rough edge surface or edges, damage to the seal can occur. Make sure that you do not break the plastic strip and leave pieces of it in the Fan. Pieces of plastic can damage the rubber.

This information is for guidance only and the AMM ref Chapter 71-31-11-200-010 should be used as the reference document. Blades are inspected for signs of the following; \u2022 Nick's. \u2022 Cracks. General \u2022 Dents. The fan blade surface area is divided into zones. The zones are; \u2022 Scores. \u2022 \u2022 Surface scratches. Ar. \u2022 \u2022 Bends on the leading or trailing edges. At. \u2022 Br. \u2022 Arc burns (lightning strikes). \u2022 Bt. \u2022 Cr. \u2022 Ct. \u2022 F. The acceptance limits for damage vary depending on which zone is damaged. Revision 2 Any blade, which has Arc burns or cracks must be rejected and a replacement blade fitted. An Arc burn is evident by a small circular or semi-circular heat affected area of the blade surface that may contain a shallow pitting, remelting or cracking. Visually a dark blue discoloration is associated with the heat-affected area Page 4-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Page 4-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance LP Compressor (Fan) Maintenance Fan Blade Inspection General Fly Back Limits The leading and trailing edges of the fan blades should be examined for bends (deformations). Accept dimension X between 0.2 and 0.5 in. (12,7 mm) providing dimensions Y & Z follow the same criteria as above. The blade must be changed within 125 hours or 25 flights, whichever is the sooner as per AMM recommendations. \u2022 The maximum number of bent blades in a fan rotor assembly is three. \u2022 No more than one bend in a blade is permitted. \u2022 If any bend has associated cracks, kinks, creases tears or nick's then the blade must be rejected as per AMM recommendations. \u2022 Bends must be outboard of the annulus fillers, if any bend extends below the annulus filler platform, reject the blade as per AMM recommendations. \u2022 Any blade untwist is acceptable as per AMM recommendations. \u2022 No bending is acceptable in the area F as per AMM recommendations. \u2022 There must be a smooth transition between the undamaged airfoil surface and the bent area. If there is not a smooth transition reject the blade as per AMM recommendations. Acceptance Limits X maximum = 0.2 in. (5,08 mm) Y must not be less than 8 times dimension X if Y is less than 8 times X, reject the fan blade. Z must not be less than 15 times dimension X if Z is less than 15 times X, reject the fan blade.

AMM 72-31-11-400-010 Method 3 When a replacement blade is installed, procedures to keep the balance of the LP compressor rotor are necessary. Method 3 uses a pair of replacement blades. The moment weight difference of the damaged blade position is compensated by non-damaged blade replacement at a diametrically opposite position. There are four methods used to correct the balance in this task. These are: \u2022 Method 1. \u2022 Method 2. \u2022 Method 3. \u2022 Method 4. The methods can be selected according to the conditions of damage seen on the LPC rotor. Method 1 Method 1 uses the trim balance weights on the 36 bolt hole flange (front blade retaining ring) to compensate the moment weight difference between the removed and installed blade. Method 4 In method 4, the distribution of all the 22 fan blades is changed. Removal and installation of all blades is necessary. When two or more blades are replaced, select the applicable method in each case if method 4 is not used. Note: Seven methods of fan blade installation procedure are given in this task. Four of the seven methods are used when balance correction is applied. The remaining three methods are used when the balance correction is not applied. (see chart below) Method 2 Method 2 uses the balance weights on the 22 bolt hole flange (front blade retaining ring) to compensate for the moment weight difference.

Background VRS 1063 is an existing AMM repair for the reattachment of LPC fan blade chocking pads, which can become detached during engine running and during removal of fan blades. Early standard blades have pads which are bonded to the fan blades using silicoset rubber compound and later standard blades have stick-on pads which use a double sided adhesive tape. The two configurations are called 'Assembly A' and 'Assembly B' in the repair. The purpose of the amendment to the repair is to include a procedure for a replacement of the stick-on pads and also to add the Uni-Directionally Profiled (UDP) blade part numbers 6A6519 for (A1) engines and 6A6521 for (A5/D5) engines.

Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) -- which is the Primary thrust control Mode. N1 Rated and Un-rated and also provides Auto Starting and Thrust Reverser control. (To be covered in detail later). \u2022 Schedules engine operation to provide maximum engine performance and fuel savings. \u2022 Provides improved engine starting (Auto Start) and transient characteristics (acceleration/deceleration). \u2022 Provides maximum engine protection and is more flexible to readily adapt to changes in engine requirements. The V2500 uses a Full Authority Digital Electronic Engine Control (FADEC). The FADEC comprises the sensors and data input, the electronic engine control unit (EEC) and the output devices, which include solenoids, fuel servo operated actuators and pneumatic servo operated devices. The FADEC also includes electrical harnesses. Engine Electronic Control The heart of the FADEC is the Engine Electronic Control (EEC) unit - shown below. The EEC is a fan case mounted unit, which is shielded and grounded as protection against EMI - mainly lightning strikes. Features \u2022 Vibration isolation mountings. \u2022 Shielded and grounded (lightning strike protection). \u2022 Size - 15.9 X 20.1 X 4.4 inches. \u2022 Weight - 41 lbs. \u2022 Two independent electronic channels. \u2022 Two independent power supplies, the EEC utilises 67.53 Watts of power from either the three phase AC from a dedicated engine mounted alternator, or 28 Volts DC from an aircraft source. \u2022 Six 'screened' pressure ports provide the required pressure inputs to both channels. \u2022 Built in handle facilitates removal and handling.

The assembled unit is sealed with a housing seal and a protective shield provides channel separation. The control assembly is separated into two modules, each containing one control channel. Each module contains two multi-layer printed circuit boards assemblies, which enable it to function independently of the other channel. Electronic Engine Control Each of the EEC channels can exercise full control of all engine functions. Control alternates between Channel A and Channel B for consecutive flights, the selection of the controlling channel being made automatically by the EEC itself. The channel not in control is nominated as the back up channel. . A mating connector provides 'Crosstalk', for partial or complete channel switching and fault isolation logic when the two modules are joined. This connector also provides for the exchange of 'crosslink data', cross wiring and hardwired discretes between the two channels. The EEC has two identical electronic circuits that are identified as Channel A and Channel B. Each channel is supplied with identical data from the aircraft and the engine. This data includes throttle position, aircraft digital data, air pressures, air temperatures, exhaust gas temperatures and rotor speeds. The EEC, to set the correct engine rating for the flight conditions uses this data. The EEC also transmits engine performance data to the aircraft. This data is used in cockpit display, thrust management and condition monitoring systems.

Purpose Then using the EEC Harness Wrench torque tighten the DEP connector to 32 lbf in. The Data Entry Plug (DEP) provides discrete data inputs to the EEC. Located on to Junction 6 of the EEC. it provides unique engine data to Channel A and B. The data transmitted by the DEP is: \u2022 EPR Modifier (Used for power setting). \u2022 Engine Rating (Selected from multiple rating options). \u2022 Engine Serial No. The DEP links the coded data inputs through the EEC by the use of shorting jumper leads which are used to select the plug pins in a unique combination. During the life of an engine, it may be necessary to change the DEP configuration, either during incorporation of Service Bulletins or after engine overhaul, when the EPR Modifier code may need to be changed. Location The data entry plug is located on the channel B side electrical connectors of the EEC. During removal/replacement of the DEP it is necessary to use an EEC harness wrench, as it is imperative that the connectors are tight. On fitment of the DEP to the EEC align the main key of the Revision 2 This is accomplished by changing the configuration of the jumper leads in accordance with the relevant instructions. Service Bulletin V2500-ENG-72-0285 contains the specific detail of the process involved for modifying the Data Entry Plug.

Each channel has its own power supply, processor, programme memory and input/output functions. The mode of operation and the selection of the channel in control is decided by the availability of input signal and output controls. \u2022 Each channel normally uses its own input signals but each channel can also use input signals from the other channel required i.e. if it recognises faulty, or suspect, inputs. \u2022 An output fault in one channel will cause switchover to control from the other channel. \u2022 In the event of faults in both channels a pre-determined hierarchy decides which channel is more capable of control and utilises that channel. \u2022 In the event of loss of either channels, or loss of electrical power, the systems are designed to go to the fail safe positions.

Dedicated Alternator During engine starts 28V DC is supplied from the aircraft bus bars until the dedicated alternator comes 'on line' at approximately 10% N2. The permanent magnet alternator has two independent sets of stator windings that supply two independent, 3 phase frequency AC outputs to the EEC. These unregulated AC supplies are rectified to 28 volts DC within the EEC Switching between the aircraft 28V supply and dedicated alternator power supplies is done automatically by the EEC so in the event of a total failure of the dedicated alternator the EEC is supplied from the aircraft 28V DC bus bars, The Dedicated Alternator also supplies N2 signals for the EEC. This is provided by the frequency of a single phase winding in the stator housing as the 'primary' speed signal used by both Channels of the EEC and for the Flight Deck instrument display of engine actual speed. Should this signal fail, there is a 'Back-up' signal which is derived from one of the three phase windings of Channel 'B' power generation. There is no speed signal generation provided by the output of the coil windings of the Dedicated Alternator Channel 'A' power supply. The EEC also utilises aircraft power to operate some engine systems: \u2022 115 volts AC 400 Hz power is required for the ignition system and inlet probe anti-icing heater. \u2022 28V DC is required for some specific functions, which include the thrust reverser, fuel on/off and ground Revision 2 Page 5-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Electronic Engine Control EEC POWER GENERATION Revision 2 Page 5-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Electronic Engine Control Dedicated Alternator Cooling Shroud Location It is important that the cooling shroud is orientated correctly for the differing variant engines. The shroud must be clamped with the arrow on the shroud aligned with the number '1' indicated position for A5 and A1 applications. For D5 applications only the arrow on the clamp must align with the number '2' indicated position. With the arrow aligned make sure that the dowel on the shroud engages in the adjacent cooling hole on the casing, this correctly aligns the cooling air inlet on the shroud with the cooling hole in the casing. Tighten the nut on the shroud to hold the shroud firmly in the correct position. Torque the nut on the alternator shroud to 180 -- 220 lbfin (20 -- 25 Nm) Connect the tube to the alternator shroud and torque tighten the tube nut to 283 -- 310 lbfin (32 -- 35 Nm) Safety the tube with locking wire. Connect the electrical connectors and torque them to 16 lbfin (1,8 Nm) If this is not carried out, the cooling airflow may not be able to enter the stator housing due to the cooling air hole on the stator being masked by the clamp body of the cooling shroud. The diagram below shows both arrangements and their relevant application.

Location The aircraft throttle is located in the flight deck. This is in reference to the TLA resolvers. The EEC is engine intermediate case mounted. This is in reference to the TRA signal that is derived from TLA. Description The throttle control lever (Thrust Lever) is based on the \"fixed throttle\" concept; there is no motorised movement of the throttle levers. Each throttle control lever drives dual throttle resolvers; each resolver output is dedicated to one EEC channel. The throttle lever angle (TLA) is the input to the resolver. The resolver output, which is fed to the EEC, is known as the Throttle Resolver Angle (TRA). The relationship between the throttle lever angle and the throttle resolver angle is linear therefore: 1 deg TLA = 1.9 deg TRA Revision 2 Page 6 - 1 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 2 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Throttle Control Lever Mechanism The throttle control mechanism for one engine is shown below. The control system consists of: \u2022 The throttle control lever. \u2022 The mechanical box. \u2022 The throttle control unit. The throttle control lever movement is transmitted through a rod to the mechanical box. The mechanical box incorporates 'soft' detents, which provides selected engine ratings, it also provides \"artificial feel\" for the throttle control system. A second rod to the throttle control unit transmits the output from the mechanical box. The throttle control unit incorporates two resolvers and six potentiometers. Each resolver is dedicated to one EEC channel; the output from the potentiometers provides T.L.A. signals to the aircraft flight management computers. A rig pin position is provided on the throttle control unit for rigging the resolvers and potentiometers. Revision 2 Page 6 - 3 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 4 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Bump Rating Push Button (A1 Engined Aircraft only) In some cases (optional) the throttle control levers are provided with \"Bump\" rating push buttons, one per engine. This enables the EEC to be re-rated to provide additional thrust capability for use during specific aircraft operations. Note: Bump Ratings can be selected, regardless of TLA only in EPR mode when aircraft is on ground. Bump Ratings can be de-selected at any time by actuating the bump rating push button, as long as the aircraft is on the ground and the Thrust Lever is not in the Max Take-Off detent. In flight, the bump ratings are fully removed when the Thrust Lever is moved from the Take-Off detent to or below the Max Continuous detent. The Bump Rating is available in flight (EPR or N1 mode) under the following conditions: \u2022 Bump Rating is initially selected on ground. \u2022 Take-Off, Go Around TOGA Thrust position set. \u2022 Aircraft is within the Take-Off envelope. When Bump Rating is selected a 'B' appears next to the associated EPR display. Use of Bump must be recorded. Flexible Takeoff (A1 & A5 Engine Aircraft) Definition of Flexible Takeoff: In many instances, the aircraft takes off with a weight lower than the maximum permissible takeoff weight. When this happens, it can meet the required performance with a decreased thrust that is adapted to the weight: This is called 'Flexible Takeoff' and the thrust is called 'Flexible Takeoff Thrust'. The use of Flexible Takeoff Thrust saves engine life. The maximum permissible takeoff weight decreases as temperature increases, so it is possible to assume a temperature at which the actual takeoff weight would be the limiting one. This temperature is called 'Flexible Temperature' or 'Assumed Temperature' and is entered into the FADEC via the MCDU PERF TO page in order to get the adapted thrust. Note! If the thrust 'Bump' is armed for takeoff and flexible thrust is used, the pilot must use the Takeoff Performance determined for the non-increased takeoff thrust (without Bump). \u2022 Thrust must not be reduced by more than 25% of the full rated thrust. When one Bump button is selected, both engines will be at the \"Bump Rated\" value. Pressing Bump again deselects Bump Rating.

An intermediate retractable mechanical stop is provided at 0 degrees. Thrust rating limit is computed according to the thrust lever position. If the thrust lever is set in a detent the FADEC will select the rating limit corresponding to this detent. Forward Thrust Range The forward thrust range is from 0 degrees to plus 45 degrees. \u2022 0 degrees = forward idle power. \u2022 45 degrees = rated take off power. If the thrust lever is set between two detents the FADEC will select the rating limit corresponding to the higher mode. Two detents are provided in this range: \u2022 Max climb (MCLB) at 25 degrees. \u2022 Max continuous (MCT)/flexible (de-rated) take off power (FLTO) at 35 degrees. Reverse Thrust Range Lifting the reverse latching lever allows the throttle to operate in the range 0 degrees to minus 20 degrees. A detent at minus 6 degrees corresponds to thrust reverse deploy commanded and reverse idle power, minus 20 degrees is max reverse power. Auto Thrust System (ATS) The Auto Thrust System can only be engaged between 0 degrees and plus 35 degrees. Two engine operation 0 degrees and Max Climb 25 degrees. One engine operation 0 degrees and Max Cont 35 degrees.

The EEC will convert this signal into a fuel flow error in order to change the fuel flow for a power level change. Description Movement of the pilots throttle control lever is sensed by the dual resolvers, which signal the TRA to the EEC. The EEC computes the fuel flow, which will produce the required thrust. The computed fuel flow request is converted to an electrical current (I) which drives the torque motor in the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) which modulates fuel servo pressure to move the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) and sets the fuel flow. A dual resolver senses movement of the FMV, which is located in the fuel metering unit next to the FMV. The dual resolver translates the fuel metering valve movement into an electrical feedback signal that is fed back to the EEC. Revision 2 Page 6 - 9 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 10 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Basic Control Loop N1 Reversion The EEC uses closed loop control based on Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) or, N1 if EPR is unobtainable. In case of no EPR (either sensed or computed) available, an automatic reversion to N1 mode is provided. EPR Closed Loop Control The EEC computes a Target EPR as a function of: \u2022 TRA (Throttle Resolver Angle). \u2022 T amb (Ambient temperature). \u2022 T2 (Engine air inlet temperature). \u2022 Alt (Altitude). \u2022 Mn (Mach Number). The EPR target is compared to the actual EPR to determine the EPR error. The EPR error is converted to a rate controlled fuel flow command (WF), which is summed with the measured fuel flow (WF actual) to produce the WF error. The W.F. error is converted to a current (I), which is sent to the FMU to drive the torque motor; this moves the FMV to change the fuel flow. The change in fuel flow causes the engine to accelerate/decelerate and brings about a change in actual EPR. This process continues until there is no EPR error. Note: The EEC controls the rate of change of fuel flow, and thus acceleration/deceleration times, as a function of the rate of change of HP Compressor Speed (N2).

N1 Reversion At the reversion to N1 mode (rated or unrated) an equivalent thrust to that achieved in EPR mode is provided until a thrust lever position change. Note: Autothrust control is lost. Rated N1 Mode An automatic reversion to rated N1 mode occurs if sensed EPR. (Either P2 or P4.9) or any of the computed EPR parameters are not available. A manual selection of N1 mode on the push buttons on the overhead panel selects rated N1 mode. (Note! The pilot is instructed to select N1 rated thrust on both engines). The N1 mode indication is displayed in blue on the upper ECAM. Also displayed, is the N1 rating limit corresponding to the thrust lever position. Note: This is not displayed in unrated N1 mode.

With both engines now selected to N1 rated thrust control, they will now be controlled to provide the required thrust levels dictated by thrust lever physical position. As N1 mode is selected on both engines, the EPR indication of both engines is not available on the upper ECAM screen. Revision 2 If in addition to losing EPR parameters either T2 or Altitude data is lost, then the EEC automatically reverts to unrated N1 thrust setting. The unrated N1 thrust setting requires the thrust to be set manually to an N1 speed. An over boost situation can occur in this mode at the full forward thrust lever position. The N1 mode indication previously displayed in blue on the upper ECAM is no longer displayed in unrated N1 mode. Note: This mode is a 'non-dispatchable mode'.

Entering, exiting these three modes is controlled by inputs to the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) Auto Thrust Mode The auto thrust mode is only available between idle and MCT when the aircraft is in flight. After take off the throttle is pulled back to the max climb position, the auto-thrust system will be active and the Automatic Flight system will provide an EPR target to provide either: - \u2022 Auto thrust is disconnected by the EIU. In the 'Memo' mode the thrust is 'frozen', to the last actual EPR value and will remain frozen until the throttle lever is moved manually, or, auto thrust is reset. Manual Thrust Mode This mode is entered anytime the conditions for AUTO or MEMO are not present. In this mode thrust is a function of throttle lever position. \u2022 Max climb thrust. \u2022 An optimum thrust. \u2022 A minimum thrust. \u2022 An aircraft speed (Mach number) in association with the autopilot.

The thrust level that 'Alpha Floor Protection' provides is that equivalent to maximum EPR level at TOGA. Note: The conditions requiring 'Alpha Floor Protection' to be invoked are extremely rare, due to the circumstances which require its operation Revision 2 Page 6 - 19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Power Management Page 6 - 20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Power Management Thrust Modes Manual Mode After Takeoff The engines are in the manual mode provided the A/THR function is: \u2212 The pilot can change from the FLX to MCT by moving the thrust lever to the Take Off Go Around (TOGA) or Climb (CL) detent, then back to MCT. After that, they cannot use the FLX rating. \u2022 Not armed or \u2022 Armed and not active (Thrust lever not in the operating range and no alpha floor). In these conditions each engine is controlled by position of its thrust lever. The pilot controls thrust by moving the thrust lever between IDLE and TOGA positions. Each position of the thrust lever within these limits corresponds to an EPR. Note! Setting the thrust lever out of the FLX/MCT detent without reaching the TOGA or CL detent has no effect. The pilot can always demand Maximum Take Off thrust by pushing the thrust lever all the way forward, to the TOGA position. When the thrust lever is in a detent, the corresponding EPR is equal to the EPR rating limit computed for that engine. When the thrust lever is in the FLX/MCT detent On the ground \u2212 The engine runs at the Flex takeoff thrust rating if the crew has selected a flex takeoff temperature on the MCDU that is higher than the current Total Air Temperature (TAT). Otherwise the engine produces Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) Note! A change in FLEX TEMP during the takeoff has no effect on the thrust.

The primary purpose of the fuel system is to provide a completely controlled continuous fuel supply in a form suitable for combustion, to the combustion system. The LP pump boosts the initial fuel delivery to a pressure so as to prevent low pressure entry into the HP pump. Nominal pressure 150psi. Description The fuel flows into the fuel oil heat exchangers for the engine and IDG. Control of the fuel supply is by the EEC via the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU). High pressure fuel is also used to provide servo pressure (actuator muscle) for the following actuators; \u2022 BSBV actuators. \u2022 VSV actuator. \u2022 ACC actuator. \u2022 ACOC actuator. The major components of the fuel system include; \u2022 High and low pressure fuel pumps (dual unit). \u2022 Fuel/oil heat exchanger. \u2022 Fuel filter. \u2022 Fuel metering unit (FMU). \u2022 Fuel distribution valve. \u2022 Fuel injectors (20). \u2022 Fuel diverter and back to tank valve (FDRV). The fuel system controls are on the centre control pedestal and the indications are in the form of an annunciator light and ECAM messages. Revision 2 Depending on the mode of operation the heat management system is in depends on which direction the fuel will flow. From the engine FCOC the fuel passes through the LP fuel filter. The filter has a 40 micron filtration capability. The fuel is received by the HP pump and is boosted to a nominal 1000 psi. The HP pump has pressure relief set at 1360 psi. The FMU meters the fuel and the excessive HP fuel is diverted back into the LP supply. The FMU is controlled by signals from the EEC. The fuel flow meter gives indication to the upper ECAM screen of real time fuel flow in KG/H. The distribution valve filters the fuel and splits the supply into ten separate outlets. The ten outlets supply fuel to two fuel spray nozzles per outlet. The fuel spray nozzles have small filters within them. This gives last chance filtration prior to fuel atomisation.

This Service Bulletin covers the fitment to engines of a FCOC incorporating design changes to prevent fuel leakage. Location The LP fuel filter is located in the LP fuel filter housing that is integral with the fuel and oil heat exchanger. Description The LP fuel filter is a woven, glass fibre, disposable, 40 micron (nominal) type. The LP fuel filter and housing have the following features; \u2022 A differential pressure switch, which generates a flight deck message, FUEL FILTER CLOG, if the differential pressure across the filter, reaches 5 psi. \u2022 A by-pass valve which opens and allows fuel to bypass the filter if the differential pressure reaches 15 psi. \u2022 A fuel drain plug, used to drain filter case or to obtain fuel samples. \u2022 Fuel temperature sensor.

They are; \u2022 Fuel metering to the combustion chamber. \u2022 Control of the opening and closing off of the fuel supply to the combustion chamber. \u2022 Overspeed protection. Location Excessive HP fuel supplies that are not required, other than that for actuator control and metered fuel to the combustor, is returned to the LP system via the spill valve. In addition to the fuel metering function the FMU also houses the overspeed valve and the pressure raising and shut off valve. The FMU is mounted on the combined fuel pumps assembly. The overspeed valve under the control of the EEC provides overspeed protection for the LP (N1) and HP (N2) rotors. The combined fuel pumps assembly is located on the rear face of the high-speed gearbox, left hand side. The pressure raising and shut off valve provides a means of isolating the fuel supplies to start and stop the engine. Description Note: The FMU is the interface between the EEC and the fuel system. There are no mechanical inputs to, or outputs from, the All the fuel delivered by the HP fuel pumps, which is more than the engine requires is passed to the FMU. The FMU, under the control of the EEC, meters the fuel supply to the fuel spray nozzles. The HP fuel pressure also provides a servo operation (muscle) for the following actuators; \u2022 Booster stage bleed valve (BSBV) actuators. \u2022 Variable stator vane (VSV) actuator. \u2022 Active clearance control (ACC) actuator. \u2022 Air cooled oil cooler (ACOC) actuator.

The three main functions of the FMU are; \u2022 Metering the fuel supplies to the fuel spray nozzles. \u2022 Overspeed protection for both the LP (N1) and HP (2) rotors. \u2022 Isolation of fuel supplied for starting/stopping the engine. Three valves arranged as follows carry out these three functions; \u2022 The Fuel Metering Valve. \u2022 The Overspeed Valve. \u2022 The Pressure Raising and Shut Off Valve (PRSOV). Fuel metering valve The fuel metering valve varies the fuel flow according to the EEC command. The positional feedback to the EEC is by a rotary variable displacement transducer (RVDT). The overspeed valve The overspeed valve protects the engine against an exceedance of; \u2022 N1 shaft speed. \u2022 N2 shaft speed. Revision 2 The feedback to the EEC of the valve operation is by a micro switch. The pressure raising and shut of valve (PRSOV) The PRSOV is an open and close type valve. The PRSOV controls the fuel to the combustor. When the valve is in the pressure raising state it is said to be open. When the valve is in the shut off state it is said to be closed. Note: The EEC has command to open the PRSOV upon an engine start. The EEC has command to close the PRSOV in auto start mode and when the N2 is below 50%. Above 50% N2 the close command is from the master lever in the flight deck only. Pressure drop governor and spill valve The pressure drop governor controls the pressure difference across the FMV. The spill valve is controlled by the pressure drop governor. The spill valve is designed to vary the excessive HP fuel pressure return to the LP system. Page 7-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Fuel System Page 7-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Fuel System Fuel System Operation Fuel metering Valve Operation Fuel metering is achieved by the Fuel Metering Valve and the Pressure Drop Regulator and Spill Valve, which act together in the following sequence: Signals from the EEC cause the torque motor to change position, which directs fuel servo pressure to re-position the Fuel Metering Valve. This changes the size of the metering orifice through which the fuel passes which in turn changes the pressure drop across the metering valve. The change in the pressure drop is sensed by the Pressure Drop Regulator which will re-position the spill valve and so increase/decrease the fuel flow through the fuel metering valve until the pressure drop is restored to its datum value. The increase/decrease in fuel flow causes the engine to accelerate/decelerate until the actual EPR is that demanded by the EEC signal. Movement of the Fuel Metering Valve is transmitted through a rack and pinion mechanism to drive a dual output position resolver. The resolver output is fed back to the EEC. The EEC automatically corrects changes in fuel density. Bimetallic washers located in the pressure drop governor and spill valve assembly provide automatic compensation for changes in fuel temperature. Revision 2 Page 7-21 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Fuel System Page 7-22 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Fuel System Fuel System Operation Note: FMU 'Emergency' Overspeed Protection Because of the fact that the overspeed valve is spring loaded to the closed position, and opened by fuel pressure, the overspeed valve will close every time the engine is shut down. The Overspeed Valve is positioned down stream, in series, with the Fuel Metering Valve. Note: It should be understood that this device is not incorporated to provide the usual N1/N2 red line limiting of max TO speed of 100%. The PRSOV will remain open due to the small amount of fuel that is allowed to flow by the shutoff vale The microswitch gives valve positional feedback to the EEC. The EEC will act through the Fuel Metering Valve to trim the fuel flow if N1 or N2 reach 100%. Operation The overspeed valve is spring loaded to the closed position, it is opened by increasing fuel pressure during engine start and during normal engine operation is always fully open. In the event of an overspeed condition (>109% N1 or >105.7% N2 ) the EEC sends a signal to the overspeed valve torque motor which changes position and directs HP fuel to the top of the overspeed valve thus fully closing the valve. A small by-pass flow is arranged around the overspeed valve to prevent engine flame out. The overspeed valve is hydraulically latched in the closed position, thus preventing the engine from being accelerated. The recommended procedure is for the flight crew to close the engine down, and not re-start. Closing down the engine is the only way to release the hydraulic latching.

The EEC's ability to close the shut off valve is inhibited above 50% N2. Its primary function is to isolate the fuel supplies to the fuel spray nozzles for starting and stopping the engine. Above 50% N2, and in flight, the PRSOV can only be closed by the crew operated switch in the flight deck. It acts as a pressure raising valve to ensure that, during engine starts, fuel is not passed to the fuel spray nozzles until fuel pressures in the FMU are high enough to ensure the control devices will function correctly. The microswitch gives valve positional feedback. The two position torque motor, which controls HP fuel pressure to operate the PRSOV also, controls a spill valve servo line. When the torque motor is selected to close the PRSOV, to shut down the engine, the spill valve servo line is opened. This will fully open the spill valve and direct all the HP fuel pump delivery back to the LP fuel system. The PRSOV torque motor is commanded open by the EEC during AUTO starts. It is commanded open by the engine master switch during a MANUAL start. The PRSOV can be commanded closed by the EEC during an AUTO start, if the EEC detects a fault in the start cycle.

The scavenge system is designed to retrieve the oil that is present in the bearing chambers and gearbox for cooling and recirculation. Description There are six scavenge pumps that are designed to suck the oil and pass it through: Oil cooling is controlled by a dedicated Heat Management System which ensure that engine oil, IDG oil and fuel temperatures are maintained at acceptable levels while ensuring the optimum cooling configuration for the best engine performance. The engine oil system can be divided into three sections. These sections are: \u2022 Pressure feed. \u2022 Scavenge. \u2022 Venting. Pressure feed The pressure feed system uses the full flow generated by the pressure pump. The pressure pump moves the oil through: \u2022 The pressure filter. \u2022 Fuel oil heat exchanger. The oil is then distributed to the engine bearings and gear drives. Revision 2 \u2022 Magnetic chip detectors. \u2022 A scavenge filter and master chip detector. Prior to returning the oil back to the oil tank. Venting The venting system is designed to allow the air and oil mix that develops in the bearing chambers and gearbox to escape to the de oiler. No.4 bearing does not have a scavenge pump. It relies upon the build up of air pressure in the bearing chamber to force the air and oil through the no.4 bearing scavenge valve and into the de oiler. Indications There are flight deck indications that allow the oil system to be monitored. There are also messages generated ECAM for further flight crew awareness.

Revision 2 Page 8-25 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Engine Oil System Page 8-26 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Engine Oil System No 4 Bearing Scavenge Valve Purpose High flow Maintains the centre bearing compartment (No 4 bearing) seal deferential pressure by controlling the venting of the compartment air/oil mixture to the de oiler. When the engine is at low power the valve is at the high flow position. Location Therefore the valve is fully open and the pressure differential is maintained across the carbon seal. The no.4 bearing scavenge valve is located on the front of the de oiler, which is located on the front face of the external gearbox. Low flow Description The no.4 bearing scavenge valve has the following features; Therefore the valve is at the restricted flow condition and the pressure differential is maintained across the carbon seal. \u2022 Operational feed back signal to EIU. Note: \u2022 Uses HPC10 air as the servo air for the valve operation. High flow at high power will cause a lower seal differential pressure. This will lead to the flow of buffer air across the carbon seal to increase. \u2022 Stage 10 air less than 150 psi the valve is at maximum open position. \u2022 Stage 10 air more than 200 psi the valve is at minimum open position. \u2022 Feedback to EIU of valve operation is the valve position indicator; scavenge oil pressure sensor and Pb indication from the EEC. When the engine is at high power the valve is at the low flow position. The increase flow of buffer air leads to the carbon seal drying out. If the valve is not in the correct position for the engine power setting, the warning message \"BEARING 4 OIL SYS\" on the upper ECAM. The no.4 bearing scavenge valve controls the flow of the scavenge oil and vent air by varying the size of the orifice of the valve. This allows the scavenge oil and vent air to enter the de oiler under controlled conditions.

The debris must be examined with a binocular microscope of 20 times magnification. If the engine or external gearbox is rejected, the debris from the MCD's and filters must be sent with the component to the overhaul shop. Metallic Flakes Metallic flakes come from these components: ball bearings, roller bearings and gear teeth. Flakes that have an irregular shape must be examined to find their origin. \u2022 Ball bearing and ball bearing track flakes are usually almost circular with radial cracks. When the flake is clean, the shiny side is much brighter than other types of flake. The shiny side also has small scratches that go across each other. \u2022 This is unwanted material that is accidentally left in the engine when it is assembled. The build debris comes from machining operations when the components are manufactured. When the material is broken it can look the same as gear or steel seal material. Roller bearing and roller bearing track flakes are usually almost rectangular in shape. When the flake is clean, the shiny side is much brighter than other types of flake. The shiny side has small scratches that go across each other. \u2022 Gear teeth flakes are shiny with an irregular shape. They are usually thicker and not as bright as ball or roller bearing flakes. Magnetic Fines Chips These are very small steel particles, which show as a black sludge on the MCD's. When the oil is removed they show as dull hair like slivers. Fines come from permitted engine wear. Bearing skid can also make fines, but the increased quantity will show during the analysis of MCD samples. These are very thick flakes or pieces of metal, which usually have one smooth machined surface. There are four main types of debris found on MCD's and in filters. They are build debris, magnetic fines, metallic flakes and chips and gear tooth fragments. Build Debris Revision 2 Gear Tooth Fragments These are the corner pieces of gear teeth and may show that the gears are not correctly aligned.

Location The following units are located about the engine fan case; \u2022 The engine FCOC. \u2022 The engine ACOC. \u2022 The IDG FCOC. \u2022 The fuel diverter and back to tank valve. \u2022 The aircraft outer wing fuel tanks. Description Three sources of cooling are available: \u2022 The LP fuel passing to the engine fuel system. \u2022 The LP fuel that is returned to the aircraft fuel tanks. There are four basic configurations between which the flow paths of fuel in the engine LP fuel system are varied. The configurations are; \u2022 Mode 1. \u2022 Mode 3. \u2022 Mode 4. \u2022 Mode 5. Within each configuration the cooling capacity may be varied by control valves that form the fuel diverter and back to tank valve. The transfer between modes of operation is determined by software logic contained in the EEC. The logic is generated around the limiting temperatures of the fuel and oil within the system together with the signal from the aircraft that permits/inhibits fuel spill to aircraft tanks. \u2022 Fan air.

The valve is operated via signals from the EEC heat management system. Location The electro-hydraulic servo valve directs a controlling fuel pressure to the operating piston. The air/oil heat exchanger (ACOC) is attached to the right hand side of the engine fan case. Depending on which side of the piston the fluid is present depends whether the valve opens or closes. It is in the four o'clock position as viewed from the rear of the engine looking forwards. An LVDT gives positional feedback to the EEC of the valves position. Description The ACOC is a plate type heat exchanger. It is operated by an electro hydraulic servo valve mechanism. The following are features of the ACOC; \u2022 Fail safe position is valve open for maximum cooling. \u2022 Fire seal forms an air tight seal between the unit outlet and the cowling orifices. \u2022 Control by either channel A or B of EEC. \u2022 Valve position feed back signal via LVDT to each channel of EEC. \u2022 Valve positioned by fuel servo pressure acting on a control piston. \u2022 Fuel servo pressure directed by the electro hydraulic servo valve assembly which incorporates a torque motor.

Command signals of the EEC control the two valves. The two valves in turn manage the flow of high pressure fuel. This is done to optimise the heat exchange process that takes place between the fuel and oil. Location The unit is bolted to the rear of the fuel/oil heat exchanger. Description Fuel Diverter Valve This valve is a two position valve and is operated by a dual coil solenoid. The control signals to energise/de-energise the solenoid come from the EEC \u2022 Solenoid energised - mode 1 or 3. \u2022 Solenoid de-energised (fail safe position) mode 4 or 5. Back to Tank Valve This valve is a modulating valve and will divert a proportion of the LP fuel back to the aircraft tanks as controlled by the EEC. The interface between the EEC and the valve is a modulating torque motor; the torque motor will direct HP servo fuel to position the valve. \u2022 Fail safe position is with the valve fully closed - no fuel return to tank.

Warning: Installation Be careful when you work on the engine components immediately after the engine is shutdown. the engine components can stay hot for up to one hour. \u2022 Discard all used gaskets and packing and replace with new items on reassembly. Do not let engine fuel stay on your skin for a long time. flush the fuel from your skin with water. the fuel is poisonous and can go through your skin and into your body. \u2022 Torque the bolts with limits quoted in the Engine Maintenance Manual. Be careful during removal/installation of the fuel diverter and return valve because it weighs 13 lb. (6 kg). \u2022 Install the FDRV to the FCOC. \u2022 Install the FCOC to the engine. \u2022 Do a functional test of the fuel recirculation cooling system (73-13-42-720-010). Caution: Do not let engine fuel or oil fall onto the engine. unwanted fuel or oil must be removed immediately with a clean lint free cloth. the fuel or oil can cause damage to the surface protection and to some parts. Do not put fuel that has been drained from the engine back in to the fuel system.

The system is fully automatic as controlled by the EEC. The four modes will be in effect aircraft/engine operating conditions exist. when certain Mode 1 This is the normal mode and is shown below. In this mode all the heat from the engine oil system and the IDG oil system is absorbed by the LP fuel flows. Some of the fuel is returned to the aircraft tanks where the heat is absorbed or dissipated within the tank. This mode is maintained if the following conditions are satisfied: \u2022 Engine not at high power setting (Take Off and early part of climb (not below 25,000ft). \u2022 Cooling spill fuel temperature less than 100 deg C. \u2022 Fuel temperature at pump inlet less than 54 deg C.

In this condition the burned fuel absorbs all the heat from the engine and I.D.G. oil systems. If however, the fuel flow is too low to provide adequate cooling the engine oil will be pre-cooled in the air/oil heat exchanger, by a modulated air flow, before passing to the fuel/oil heat exchanger. This is the preferred mode of operation, when return to tank is not allowed Revision 2 Page 9-13 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Heat Management System Page 9-14 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Heat Management System Heat Management System Mode 4 Mode 4 is the mode adopted when the burned fuel flow is low. For example; Low engine speeds. High HP fuel pump inlet temperature. In this mode the fuel/oil heat exchanger is operating as a fuel cooler. The excessive heat is passed to the engine oil. The ACOC extracts the heat from the oil that has been heated up by the hot fuel.

The variable vanes control the angle at which the air enters the first five stages of the H.P. compressor. The actuator incorporates an LVDT which signals actuator positional information back to the EEC. The angle varies with the H.P. compressor speed (N2); this reduces the risk of blade stall and compressor surge. The five stages of variable incidence stators comprise inlet guide vanes to stage 3 and stages 3, 4, 5 and 6 stator vanes. Mechanical Arrangement Each vane has pivots at its inner and outer ends, which allow the vane to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The outer end of each vane is formed into a shaft which passes through the compressor case and is attached by a short lever to a 'unison ring', (one unison ring for each stage). Short rods to a crankshaft connect the five unison rings. A short rod to an actuator that utilises H.P. fuel as a hydraulic operating medium connects the crankshaft. Signals from the EEC direct H.P. fuel to extend/retract the actuator. Actuator movement causes the crankshaft to rotate, and, through the unison rings, reposition the variable stator vanes.

A total of four bleed valves are used, three on stage 7 and one on stage 10. The handling bleed valves are 'two position' only - fully open or fully closed, and are operated pneumatically by their respective solenoid control valve. The solenoid control valves are scheduled by the EEC as a function of N2 and T2.6 (N2 corrected). When the bleed valves are open, H.P. compressor air bleeds into the fan duct through ports in the inner barrel of the 'C' ducts. The servo air used to operate the bleed valves is H.P. compressor delivery air known as P3 or Pb. The bleed valves are arranged radially around the H.P. compressor case as shown below. Silencers are used on some bleed valves. All the bleed valves are spring loaded to the open position and as a result will always be in the correct position (open) for starting.

Steady State The valves are commanded 'open' whenever N2C26 is below the steady state closing speed. Transient The valves are commanded 'open' at the beginning of accelerations/decelerations and will 'close' when either the speed limits are exceeded or timers expire. After an acceleration phase has ceased, the valve will remain open until a period of 5 seconds have elapsed, after which it will then be signalled to close. During a deceleration phase the valve will remain open until a period of 62 seconds have elapsed after the engine has stabilised at the new engine speed. Surge/Reverse The valves will be commanded open in the event of a surge. In reverse thrust laws similar to the transient laws apply.

The operation of one bleed valve only is described. Bleed Valves The bleed valve is a two-position valve and is either fully open or fully closed. The bleed valve is spring loaded to the open position and so all the bleed valves will be in the correct position - open - for engine start. When the engine is started the bleed air will try to close the valve. The valve is kept in the open position by servo air (P3) supplied from the solenoid control valve, (solenoid de-energised) as shown below.

The bleed valve is closed by the EEC, which energises the solenoid control valve, as shown below. Energising the solenoid control valve vents the P3 servo air from the opening chamber of the bleed valve, and the valve will move to the closed position.

The HP Compressor rotor path lining is designed to be worn away by the rotor blades of the compressor. All bleed valves (3 off stage 7, 1 off stage 10) are spring loaded to the 'open' position for engine starting. As air is expelled through the bleed valves during their normal operation, some of the debris from the rotor path lining contaminates the valve seals. They are held open during engine running, by solenoid valve directed P3 air. According to schedule requirements, the bleed valves will close progressively during the starting cycle in the sequence 7B, 10, and 7C. If this lining becomes lodged in the carbon seals within the bleed valve then there is the possibility that this will prevent the valve from operating smoothly and the valve will seize. The 7A valve stays open up to and above idle. If the valve does not operate when required, the engine will experience problems at critical points. Handling Bleed consequences: \u2022 valves failures have two major Hung Start: If the bleed valve sticks in the closed condition, (Nondetected FADEC fault) or the solenoid valve sticking in the 'energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault) the engine will experience difficulty in starting 'hung start or surge' during the start cycle. This is due to the fact that during low engine speeds, the bleed valve system is designed to effectively 'dump' into the 'C' duct a large amount of the air supplied to the HP Compressor. This is necessary because of the HP Compressor's inability to handle all the mass flow of air being supplied to it by the LP Compressor during low speed operation.

If a bleed valve fails to close when required to do so, under certain conditions the engine may exceed the recommended EGT operating limits thus preventing the aircraft from taking off. This increases the Exceedance/Overlimit. likelihood of an EGT This will be caused as a result of the EEC trying to achieve Take-off EPR but with a reduced volume of air being supplied to the combustion chamber for mixing with fuel, ignition and subsequent expansion. Additionally, an open bleed valve as a result of bleed valve system problems will also result in unexplained engine parameter shifts. Therefore the EEC makes up for the shortfall in the available volume of air and simply demands the FMU to provide more fuel to compensate. \u2022 Bleed valve(s) stuck open (Non-detected FADEC fault). \u2022 Solenoid valve sticking in the de-energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault). \u2022 An electrical failure of the solenoid valve which results in the solenoid moving to the de-energised position (FADEC fault). The resultant 'over-fuelling' provides the required EPR, but with the penalty of increased EGT. TSM Supporting data 75-00-00-301 (Bleed Valve Troubleshooting Hints) give comprehensive recommendations in the diagnosis of bleed valve related problems. Possible causes: Rigorous troubleshooting would reduce large number of NFF cases. The lubrication of bleed valves should not be carried out.

Engine Operation Impact \u2022 Bleed valves closing early can be due to the solenoid sticking such that the full de-energised position is not obtained (Non-detected FADEC fault), bleed valve internal seal wear and leakage of P3 servo air. During transient manoeuvres (acceleration/deceleration) and surge recovery, HP compressor stability is maintained by opening particular bleed valves as defined by the EEC logic. For transient manoeuvres on the ground, the 7C are opened and during flight both the 7A and 7C are opened. In both cases the 7C are opened based upon a transient detect and is closed after a set period of time has elapsed. There are no valves opened at take-off power or steady state cruise. For surge recovery, the 7A, 7C and 10 stage bleed valves are opened to maintain compressor stability. Possible causes Engine problems (stall/surge) on transient operation can be the result of: \u2022 Bleed valve(s) not being opened during the transient (acceleration/deceleration) \u2022 Bleed valve closing early. \u2022 Bleed valves not being open can be due to the bleed valve sticking in the closed position (Non-detected FADEC fault), or the solenoid sticking in the energised position (Non-detected FADEC fault).

The valve position is controlled by the EEC as a function of corrected N2 and altitude. Description Aircraft Services Air Offtake System The secondary air system is made up of the following: The engine supplies the aircraft with bleed air taken from HPC stages 7 and 10. \u2022 Active clearance control system (ACC). \u2022 10th stage make up air system. The air that is taken from the engine is used for the following: \u2022 Aircraft services bleed system. \u2022 Cabin pressurisation and conditioning. \u2022 Air cooled air cooler (ACAC) for the no.4 bearing cooling and sealing. \u2022 Wing anti icing. Active Clearance Control (ACC) The system improves engine performance by ensuring that the HPT and LPT operate with optimum turbine blade tip clearances. This is achieved by directing a controlled flow of cooling air to reduce the thermal growth of the turbine casings. This minimises the increase in turbine blade tip clearances which otherwise occurs during the climb and cruise phases. \u2022 Engine cross feed starting. \u2022 Hydraulic system pressurisation. \u2022 Water system pressurisation. The required air is bled from the HPC of each engine. Air cooled air cooler (ACAC) HPC12 air is used for cooling and sealing the no.4 bearing in the centre bearing compartment. 10th Stage Make Up Air System The ACAC pre cools the HPC12 air prior to the air being passed to the centre bearing compartment. The purpose of this system is to provide additional cooling airflow to the HPT stage 2 disc and blades. The cooled HPC12 air is commonly known as buffer air. The cooling air used is taken from the 10th stage manifold and is controlled by a two position pneumatically operated valve. Revision 2 The ACAC uses fan bypass air as the cooling medium.

This is achieved by directing a controlled flow of cooling air to reduce the thermal growth of the turbine casings. This minimises the increase in turbine blade tip clearances which otherwise occurs during the climb and cruise phases. Location The ACC system is mainly located about the core engine. The operating actuator moves in a linear motion by the influence of fuel pressure. The EEC receives feedback of the actuator position by an LVDT. The operating actuator moves a linkage that controls the valves in the modulating air control unit for the LPT and HPT case cooling. The HPT and LPT casings are cooled by fan bypass air that is ducted from the fan bypass. Failsafe Position The ACC system consists of the following items: Upon the event of fuel pressure loss and/or EEC power failure the ACC modulating air control valves will adopt the following positions; \u2022 LPT and HPT cooling manifolds. \u2022 LPT is --44% open. \u2022 Operating actuator with LVDT feedback. \u2022 HPT is closed. Description \u2022 Modulating air control valve unit. \u2022 EEC control. \u2022 Fan bypass air cooling medium. The EEC controls the ACC system by monitoring the following parameters: \u2022 Corrected N2. \u2022 Aircraft altitude. From these two parameters the EEC will signal the operating actuator.

The modulating air control valve receives ducted air from the fan bypass stream and regulates, as per ACC actuator input, the flow rate to the LPT and HPT ACC manifolds. Location Location The ACC actuator is located on the right hand side of the core engine in the 5 o'clock position. It is mounted on the compressor casing. The modulating air control valve is located on the right hand side of the core engine in the 5 o'clock position. It is mounted on the turbine casing. Description Description The ACC actuator consists of the following: The modulating air control valve has two separate valves. They are: \u2022 Linear motion two directional piston. \u2022 Dual track LVDT. \u2022 Electro hydraulic torque motor. \u2022 Filter. The ACC actuator receives signals from the EEC. The torque motor will direct high pressure fuel to one of the two sides of the piston. This is dependent on the EEC command signal. \u2022 HPT valve. \u2022 LPT valve. The two valves are designed to operate to allow the optimum airflow to the respective casings. The failsafe position is: \u2022 HPT is closed. \u2022 LPT is --44% open. Piston movement will result in a movement in the push pull rod that links the ACC actuator and the modulating air valve. The LVDT will feedback the piston position to the EEC. At engine shut down or nil servo pressure the ACC actuator will assume the failsafe position. A spring in the ACC actuator will force the piston to the failsafe position.

This is done to reduce the rotor blade tip to rotor path gap. The LPT ACC manifold is designed to impinge cooling air onto the turbine casing about the rotor blade path. This is done to reduce the rotor blade tip to rotor path gap. Location Location The HPT ACC manifold is located on the HPT casing. The LPT ACC manifold is located on the LPT casing. Description Description The assembly consists of left and right hand tube assemblies, which are a simple push fit into the manifold. The tube assemblies are sealed off at their upper ends. The assembly consists of upper and lower tube assemblies with integral manifolds; both ends of the cooling tubes are sealed. Air from the air control valve enters the manifold and is directed to the left and right tubes. Air from the air control valve enters a supply tube, which then splits to feed air into two tubes that supply the upper and lower manifolds. The manifolds direct the air into the cooling air tubes. Air outlet holes on the inner face of the tubes direct the air onto the HPT casings. Air outlet holes on the inner surfaces direct the air onto the LPT cases.

The EEC controls the opening and closing of the ACC system by monitoring input signals of; \u2022 Corrected N2. \u2022 Altitude. The EEC commands an input signal to the torque motor. The torque motor positions the jet pipe servo valve. Position A At position A the engine is shut down. This is also the failsafe position. HPT ACC valve is closed. LPT ACC valve is at --44%. The torque motor can deflect the jet pipe servo valve to bias the direction of flow of the servo fuel pressure. Position B The jet pipe servo valve controls the direction of flow of servo fuel pressure to effectively move the pilot valve. HPT ACC is closed. The pilot valve moves and admits servo fuel pressure to either side of the piston. Servo fuel pressure will act on one side of the piston at any one time when a movement is required. This position represents idling conditions. LPT ACC is closed. Position C This position represents a typical take off condition. This position is altitude dependent. The movement of the piston moves a push pull rod that in turn operates the modulating air control valve. HPT ACC is starting to open. When stabilisation of the piston is required the EEC will cancel the input signal to the torque motor. Position D and E This allows the jet pipe to return to the central position and as a result of this the pilot valve will move into the equilibrium position. Servo fuel pressure is now present on both sides of the pilot valve. The spring will bias the pilot valve position by forcing it to one side. LPT ACC is at 70%. These positions represent typically cruise and top of descent conditions. This position is altitude dependent. HPT ACC at D is 30% and at E is fully open. LPT ACC is fully open at points D and E. The dual track LVDTs will send feedback signals to the EEC of the ACC system operation.

The microswitch gives a positional feedback signal to the EEC indicating of either: Description \u2022 Valve open. The 10th stage make up air valve system consists of the following components: \u2022 Valve closed. \u2022 EEC control. The valve is open for all conditions of flight/engine operation except for cruise. \u2022 Make up valve control solenoid. In cruise the valve is closed. \u2022 Two position type on/off valve. \u2022 Microswitch positional feedback. The EEC uses input signals of: \u2022 Corrected N2. \u2022 Altitude. The EEC to signal the control solenoid to operate uses these inputs. The control solenoid manages the flow of P3 (HPC stage 12) air for the pneumatic operating medium. The two position make up air valve either opens to flow stage 10 air or closes for no flow. The solenoid is de energised when the valve is in the open position. This is the fail safe position.

The control solenoid valve purpose is to manage the flow of servo air pressure to the make up air valve. Location The control solenoid is located on the right hand side of the fan case approximately in the 4 o'clock position. th The 10 stage make up air valve is located at the top of the HPC casing. Description The 10th stage make up air valve consists of the following components: \u2022 Operating piston. \u2022 Microswitch feedback. Location Description The control solenoid consists of the following components: Solenoid pack. Pilot valve. Valve body. \u2022 Valve body. The solenoid control valve will direct the flow of servo air pressure to port when it is de-energised. The valve is a two positional type. It can either allow flow HPC stage 10 air or cut it off from the engine. There is no modulation. The solenoid control valve will direct the flow of servo air pressure to the make up valve when it is energised. The operating piston is spring loaded to the open position when servo air is not present in the piston chamber. Servo air is used to close the valve. The micro switch gives positional feedback of the piston position hence the valves condition. The fail safe position is valve open.

The make up air valve will be commanded to open during all flight conditions except during cruise. To Energise the Solenoid Valve The solenoid pack attracts the cover plate A towards it thus opening up the chamber that is at the spring side of the pilot valve. The servo air pressure and spring pressure at the spring end of the pilot valve overcomes the servo air pressure alone on the opposite side of the pilot valve. This makes the pilot valve move towards the cover plate B. Cover plate B is pushed away from the orifice allowing servo air to enter the make up valve. The servo air enters the make up valve piston chamber in the opposite side to the spring side. The servo air pressure overcomes the spring pressure and forces the piston to move and hence close the valve. The microswitch contacts are broken and a feedback signal is fed to the EEC. Revision 2 Page 11-15 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Engine Secondary Air Systems Page 11-16 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Engine Secondary Air Systems To De-Energise the Solenoid Valve The solenoid pack is de-energised. The cover plate A is force away from the solenoid pack by spring pressure and forced against the orifice. This prevents servo air from entering the spring side of the pilot valve. Servo air pressure on the opposite side of the pilot valve now forces this valve against the spring. As the pilot valve moves cover plate B closes off the orifice. This prevents servo air pressure from entering the make up valve piston chamber. The spring affecting the piston valve forces the piston to move and open the make up valve orifice. The microswitch contacts are made and a feedback signal is fed to the EEC. Fail Safe Position The fail safe position has the valve in the open position hence solenoid de-energised. This is also true if a power loss is experienced or a loss of servo air pressure.

The precooler prepares the bleed air to an acceptable temperature before it enters the environmental control system (ECS). \u2022 Wing leading edge anti icing. \u2022 Engine cross bleed starting. \u2022 Hydraulic system pressurisation. Location The bleed air offtakes are taken from: \u2022 HPC stage 7 for high power conditions. \u2022 HPC stage 10 for low power conditions. Description HPC air is taken from the engine and ducted towards the aircraft services. The pre cooler utilises fan bypass air to cool the HPC bleed air. The temperature limiting thermostat (TLT) controls the PRV when an over temperature has been experienced. The temperature controlling thermostat (TCT) controls the pre cooler valve but if bleed temperature cannot be maintained the temperature limiting thermostat will signal for the PRV to close. The bleed monitoring computer controls the functions of bleed air system making the system fully automatic. The HPC stage 7 offtake has a non return valve installed before the two offtakes join. The NRV protects against HPC stage 10 air from reverse flowing back into the HPC stage 7 of the engine. The HPC stage 10 offtake has a control valve called the high pressure valve (HPV). After the two offtakes come together as one there is a pressure regulating valve (PRV). A switch located in the flight deck controls the PRV.

Temperature controlling thermostat (TCT) The selection of HPC stage 7 (also called IP bleed air) or HPC stage 10 is automatically done by the BMC. TCT will regulate the temperature of the air entering the aircraft system to 200 +/- 15 deg.c. The TCT controls the opening/closing of the Fan air valve to regulate the fan airflow through the Pre -- cooler. High pressure valve (HPV) The HPV will regulate HPC stage 10 air to 36+/- 3 psi. The HPV will close if upstream pressure is greater than 100 +/- 5 psi and/or downstream HPC stage 7 greater than 36 +/- 3 psi. The pressure sensors feedback pressure signals to the BMC.

The ACAC uses fan bypass air as the cooling medium. The cooled HPC12 (buffer) air enters the cooling jacket of the centre bearing chamber. Location The buffer air protects the no.4 bearing from excessive heat exposure. The ACAC is located on the turbine casing. Bottom left hand side in the 5 o'clock position. Description The ACAC is a fin and tube type design. The fan bypass airflow that is utilised by the ACAC extracts heat from the HPC12 air. The HPC12 air is taken off the engine through a singular tube. The buffer air enters the bearing compartment to prevent oil loss. This also pressurises the bearing chamber to allow the oil and air mix to leave the bearing chamber and enter the de oiler. The centre bearing compartment does not have oil scavenge pump. The HPC12 air enters the ACAC and the heat exchange process takes place between the fan bypass air and the hot HPC12 air. The fan bypass air is ejected to atmosphere. The cooled HPC12 air leaves the ACAC and is distributed to the centre bearing compartment through three tubes. The tubes enter the diffuser casing in three positions. They are: \u2022 12 o'clock. \u2022 3 o'clock. \u2022 9 o'clock.

Ice build about the inlet cowl leading edge could affect engine performance and could cause engine damage from ice ingestion. The distribution manifold will allow hot air to enter the inlet cowl leading edge. The excessive air is ejected overboard via an outlet located on the right hand side of the inlet cowl. Fault indications for the ice protection system are as follows: To prevent ice formation ice protection systems have been incorporated into the engine. The flight deck anti icing selector switch illuminates. The inlet cowl leading edge is thermally ice protected. P2/T2 probe heater The P2/T2 probe mounted in the inlet cowl is thermally ice protected. The P2/T2 probe is continuously heated during engine operation by an integral 115V heating coil. The spinner of the fan module is ice protected by a flexible rubber tip. Spinner An ECAM warning message is generated. The engine ice protection system description is as follows: A solid rubber nose tip that vibrates naturally to break up and dislodge the ice immediately it starts to form protects the spinner against ice build up. Inlet cowl ice protection Ground running The inlet cowl is thermally heated to prevent ice formation at the leading edge of the intake lip. Icing conditions may occur when temperature (OAT) is less than: The ice protection system for the inlet cowl is controlled from the flight deck by a selector switch. The switch will control the opening and closing of the TAI valve. 5.5 deg.c (42 deg.f). The valve will allow the airflow taken from the HPC stage 7 to flow to the distribution manifold in the inlet cowl leading edge lip. If the above conditions exist the ice protection system must be operated as soon as the engine stabilises at low idle conditions after an engine start.

Location The anti icing valve is located on the right hand side of the fan case in the 4 o'clock position. Description The anti icing control valve has the following function: \u2022 On/off selection from the flight deck to allow the flow of warm air to the TAI manifold. The anti icing valve is made up of the following items: \u2022 Valve body. \u2022 Linear moving piston. \u2022 Control solenoid. \u2022 Air filter. \u2022 Butterfly valve. \u2022 Micro switch. \u2022 Manual override (as per MMEL requirements).

The valve has provision for being secured in either the; The ball valve of the control solenoid is hard against the ambient vent outlet. This prevents upstream air from escaping to vent. \u2022 Locked position. The pressure acting on the piston at position area A is greater than the pressure acting on position area B. This along with spring pressure holds the butterfly valve in the closed position. \u2022 Open position. This requirement is necessary when a valve has failed. The MMEL will advise of the actions required to allow despatch of the aircraft. Valve open The control solenoid is de energised. The ball valve is no longer held by the control solenoid against the ambient vent. The ball valve moves by spring pressure against the orifice, which allows upstream air to enter area A. This now prevents air passage to area A of the piston. The air pressure now remains at piston area B only. This pressure is greater than the spring pressure alone therefor the piston moves against the spring pressure.

Hence if the phonic wheel has 60 teeth then 60 pulses represents a complete revolution of the N1 shaft. N2 System The indications are used for: The N2 indication is supplied by a dual output signal from channel B of the dedicated generator. \u2022 The ECAM CRT display. \u2022 An output goes to the channel B side of the EEC. \u2022 EEC control. \u2022 An output goes to the EVMU. A dedicated signal is used for trim balancing purposes. Location Fan Trim Balance The N1 speed sensors are located in the front bearing chamber mounted on the no.2 bearing support. The fan trim balance probe is located in the same place as the speed pulse probes. This probe supplies a dedicated signal for monitoring of LP system unbalance. The N2 speed indication is the output signals from the dedicated generator. The probe is also different from the speed probes. It cannot be utilised to give N1 speed indication. Description The pulse probe monitors a datum tooth of the phonic wheel. This tooth is in line with the no.1 fan blade. The speed indicating description is as follows: N1 System Three pulse probes supply the N1 indication. The pulse probes operate by monitoring the passage of a phonic wheel. The phonic wheel passage across the pulse probe generates an output signal relative to a percentage of a revolution. Revision 2 Page 13-19 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance l Revision 2 Engine Indications Page 13-20 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance l Engine Indications N1Speed Indicating System Operation The probes comprise of two pole pieces, a permanent magnet, and a coil wound on to one of the pole pieces. The pole pieces span two teeth of the phonic wheel. The phonic wheel is an integral part of the fan stub-shaft and has 60 teeth. As the shaft rotates and the teeth of the phonic wheel pass the pole pieces and a voltage pulse is produced in the winding. The number of pulses produced is directly proportional to the speed of the shaft. This signal is passed to the EEC and is used to display N1 speed on the flight deck and also for the engine control circuits as required. Trim Balance Probe The signal from this probe is only used during trim balance operations and provides the phase relationship between any out of balance forces present and a datum position. The trim balance probe senses the passage of one specially modified tooth on the phonic wheel and produces one pulse per revolution.

In both cases the start sequence is initiated in the flight deck. The engine starting system provides the power which turns the HP rotor to a speed at which an engine start can occur. The engine ignition system provides the electrical spark that is required to ignite the fuel air mix in the combustor. The ignition system is used for: \u2022 Engine starting on ground and in flight. \u2022 Prevention of a flame out by providing a continuous spark during engine running when the aircraft is flying through a heavy rainstorm for example. Upon selection for engine start an electrical signal is sent to open the starting air valve. The starting air valve opens and admits an air supply into the starter motor. The starter motor rotates the high speed external gearbox, that in turn rotates the radial drive shaft (tower shaft), that in turn rotates the HP system (N2). As the HP system spools up the LP system starts to rotate due to the induced airflow. Description \u2022 At 10% N2 the dedicated generator comes on line. The system comprises of the following: \u2022 The HP system is rotated for 30 seconds to remove rotor bow. \u2022 Pneumatic starter motor. \u2022 Starter air control valve. \u2022 After 30 seconds the fuel and ignition are selected on. \u2022 Dual ignition system. \u2022 \u2022 Pneumatic ducting. When ignition of the fuel takes place the engine accelerates towards minimum idle \u2022 Start control panels on the flight deck for auto starts, manual starts and starter motor operation. \u2022 ECAM indications. Starting of the engine for the Airbus A319, 320 and 321 can be done either: \u2022 Manually. \u2022 Automatically. Revision 2 At 43% N2 the starter air valve is deselected, by the EEC. At 50% N2 and above the EEC auto start protection is cancelled. The engine idles at approximately 60% N2. Note: Above 50% N2 the command for engine shut down is done from the master lever only.

The starter air valve controls the airflow from the air ducting to the starter motor. The valve is commanded from the flight deck via the EEC. The start valve basically comprises a butterfly type valve housed in a cylindrical valve body with in line flanged end connectors, an actuator, a solenoid valve and a pressure controller. Location The starter air control valve is located on the right hand side of the engine fan casing (intermediate module). Description The starter air control valve consists of the following: \u2022 Butterfly valve for airflow control. \u2022 Pneumatically operated. \u2022 Microswitch position indication for valve positional status. \u2022 Air filter to prevent valve operating mechanisms from contamination. \u2022 Failsafe position of the valve is closed. \u2022 Provision of a manual override for abnormal start attempts. Manual operation The starter air valve can be opened/closed manually using a 0.375 in square drive. Access is through a panel in the right hand side fan cowl door. A valve position indicator is provided on the valve body. A micro switch provides valve position feed back information to the EEC. The starter air control valve is a pneumatically operated, electrically controlled shut-off valve. The valve is positioned on the lower right hand side of the engine fan casing. Revision 2 Page 14-5 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Engine Starting and Ignition System Page 14-6 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Engine Starting and Ignition System Starter Air Valve Operation Valve closing The starter air valve operation for opening and closing is as follows: When the solenoid is de-energised, at approximately 6000 rpm (43%) N2, the ball valve closes and air acting on the larger piston are vented to atmosphere through the vent. Engine shutdown With no pneumatic air supply available the valve is spring loaded to the closed position. Valve opening Air upstream of the butterfly valve is filtered and routed through an orifice in the solenoid valve. Air pressure and actuator spring pressure acting on the smaller piston then closes the butterfly valve. Any loss of air pressure will cause the butterfly valve to close under the action of the actuator spring. Air upstream of the orifice is also admitted to the smaller piston of the double acting actuator. When the solenoid is energised the ball valve opens to admit air to the larger piston whilst simultaneously closing the vent port. The air acting on the larger piston overcomes the combined force of upstream air pressure acting on the smaller piston and the actuator spring. Movement of the actuator is translated through the linkage to rotate the butterfly valve towards the open position.

Location The starter motor is located on the front face of the high speed external gearbox. Description The starter motor consists of the following: \u2022 Oil filler/level plug. \u2022 Drain plug with a built in magnetic chip detector. \u2022 QAD devices to allow for ease of maintenance. The starter motor gears and bearings are lubricated by an integral lubrication system. A quick attach/disconnect adapter (QAD) attaches the starter motor to the external gearbox. A quick detach Vee clamp connects the starter motor to the adapter. Note: There are two standards of starter motor available for the V2500 Powerplant. The current being the synchronous clutch engagement unit. The synchronous clutch allows for smoother crash engagements thus reducing the wear and damage caused by such operations. Revision 2 Page 14-9 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Engine Starting and Ignition System Page 14-10 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Engine Starting and Ignition System Starter Motor Operation The starter is a pneumatically driven turbine unit that accelerates the HP rotor to the required speed for engine starting. The starter comprises of the following: \u2022 A single stage turbine. When the starter output drive shaft rotational speed increases above a predetermined rpm, Centrifugal force overcomes the tension of the clutch leaf springs, allowing the pawls to be pulled clear of the gear hub ratchet teeth to disengage the output drive shaft from the turbine. \u2022 A reduction gear train. \u2022 A clutch and an output drive shaft. These are all housed within a case incorporating an air inlet and exhaust. Compressed air enters the starter, impinges on the turbine blades to rotate the turbine, and leaves through the air exhaust. The reduction gear train converts the high speed, low torque rotation of the turbine to low speed, high torque rotation of the gear train hub. The ratchet teeth of the gear hub engage the pawls of the output drive shaft to transmit drive to the external gearbox, which in turn accelerates the engine HP compressor rotor assembly. When the air supply to the starter is cut off, the pawls overrun the gear train hub ratchet teeth allowing the turbine to coast to a stop. The engine HP turbine compressor assembly, the external gearbox and starter output drive shaft continue to rotate.

It also assists deceleration during an aborted takeoff. Location The thrust reverser is an integral part of the C duct assembly. The C duct assembly is mounted to the aircraft strut by four hinged brackets located at the top of the C ducts. They are held in the closed position by six latch locks located at the bottom of the C ducts. Description The reverser is a translating sleeve type system. It directs the fan air rearwards for normal forward thrust or forwards for thrust reverse. When the thrust reverser system is in the stow position the fan air exhausts at the common nozzle. This produces forward thrust. Reverse thrust is selected from the flight deck by the gated reverse thrust levers. The EEC has control over the operation of the thrust reverse system. All signals to and from the thrust reverser are through the EIU and EEC. Thrust reverser system features Electronic control. Hydraulic actuation system. Positional information feedback. Actuator lock position sensors and feedback. Electronic safety locks. Automatic restow system. Manual deployment and stow capability for maintenance. Manual lockout to allow aircraft to be despatched with an inoperative thrust reverser. When the thrust reverser is deployed four linear motion actuators cause the translating sleeves to move rearwards. This moves the blocker doors from an axial to a radial position in the C duct fan exhaust area. The blocker doors forces the fan air through the cascades in a forward direction. The cascades are exposed whenever the thrust reverser is deployed.

Thrust Reverser Assembly When the translating sleeves are in the forward thrust position the path of the fan bypass air is in the normal forward thrust. Rearward movement of the translating sleeves unveils the cascade deflectors and moves the blocker flaps from an axial to a radial position. This blocks the fan stream airflow and forces the fan efflux through the cascade deflectors. \u2022 Shut off valve that is signalled to operate from the SEC. \u2022 The thrust reverser also has a system that will return the engine thrust to idle should the thrust reverse system inadvertently deploy. \u2022 Auto restow is a system that is designed to stow the thrust reverser when an uncommanded deployment is detected. Methods of deployment Indications The thrust reverser can be deployed in one of two methods; ECAM indications for fault annunciation of the thrust reverser system status are done by use of proximity sensors, relay select status, hydraulic system pressures and LVDT feedback signals. \u2022 \u2022 Using the engine/aircraft hydraulic system. Moving the thrust reverse select levers that are mounted on the main forward levers does selection. Manual input by two maintenance purposes. hand turning points for Safety features The locking actuator sensors detect unlocked conditions and the LVDT detects transient and deployed conditions. The signals are relayed from the EEC to the EIU and then to the ECAM screens. The thrust reverse system operation is controlled by the engine electronic control (EEC). The following are EEC controlled functions of the thrust reverse system. The thrust reverse system incorporates a double lock safety system to protect against inadvertent deployment. They are; \u2022 Landing gear control unit (LGCU). \u2022 Lock sensors on the locking actuators. \u2022 EIU inhibit relays for uncommanded in-flight Revision 2 Page 15-3 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-4 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Operation Thrust reverse is selected from the flight deck by pulling up on the thrust reverse select levers. The select levers are mounted on the front side of the main thrust levers. The thrust levers have a gated feature that allows thrust operation by the throttles in one direction only. The EEC has control of the thrust reverse system operation for deploy and stow. The EIU inhibit relay controls the DCV power signal for the control solenoid from the EEC to the DCV. Deploy Pulling up on the thrust reverse lever in the flight deck will send a signal for thrust reverse select to the EEC. This will also put the main throttles in the reverse thrust quadrant. The EEC will look for the following conditions before thrust reverse will be allowed; \u2022 The EEC will check that the aircraft is on the ground by checking the LGCU signal of the aircraft computers. \u2022 The EEC will check that the engine is running by means of a N2 signal. \u2022 The EEC cannot deploy the thrust reverser until the EIU inhibit relay is active. \u2022 SEC control signal for the shut off valve. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid and the directional control valve solenoid will both be energised for a deploy condition. This will admit high pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow and deploy sides of the thrust reverse system. The lower locking actuators will unlock and the EEC will see a signal from the proximity sensor of reverser system unlocked. In the flight deck this unlocked condition is identified as an amber coloured REV caption on the EPR indicating gauge. Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System When the translating sleeves have moved to 78% of the full deploy position the amber REV indication will change to a green REV indication. When green REV is indicated the full reverse thrust power is available to the flight crew. Stow To stow the thrust reverse system the flight crew will return the throttles to the idle detent position and select levers to the down position. This will put the throttles back to the forward thrust quadrant. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid is energised and the directional control valve solenoid is de-energised for a stow condition. This leaves high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the system. As the translating sleeves move from deploy back to stow the flight deck indication will change from green to amber on the REV indication. When the thrust reverser has reached the fully stowed position the amber REV will go and the EPR gauge will return to normal indication. This will indicate that the thrust reverser is fully stowed and locked.

Controls Pulling the levers upwards will initiate the sequence of events that will deploy the reverser system. The EEC, in conjunction with the EIU, controls the deployment and stowing of the reverser system. The levers move into the thrust reverse quadrant therefor while in this position throttle movement is only possible in the thrust reverse mode. Movement towards the maximum throttle stop for thrust reverse is possible but the engine will only accelerate when the EEC has feedback of the translating sleeve status. The translating sleeve must be beyond 78% of the fully deployed position. Stowing the thrust reverser requires the latching select levers to be pushed down and the main throttles will revert back to normal forward thrust. This will also stow the reverser system. Normal indication Thrust reverser stowed and locked. REV in colour amber Thrust reverser and in transit. REV in colour green Thrust reverser deployed. unlocked Thrust reverser indications of non-normal conditions will be indicated to the ECAM screens in the form of a message. The following are the associated ECAM messages that appear to the ECAM screens; \u2022 Reverse Unlocked. \u2022 Reverser Fault. \u2022 Rev pressurised. \u2022 Rev Switch Fault. By entering the CFDS screens the faults can be interpreted to pinpoint the location. Indications The thrust reverser system indications appear on the ECAM CRTs. The EPR indication is used to display the status of the thrust reverser. Revision 2 Page 15-7 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-8 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Hydraulic System The hydraulic system provides the force required to move the translating sleeves for both deploy and stow conditions. The hydraulic system comprises of the following; \u2022 Linear motion actuators. \u2022 Flex shaft. \u2022 Hydraulic control unit comprising of a HIV and DCV. Linear Motion Actuators There are four linear motion actuators per C duct set. The two upper actuators are non-locking and incorporate LVDT's for feedback to the EEC. The HIV controls the presence of high pressure hydraulic fluid in the thrust reverser system. The energising of a control solenoid valve controls this valve. For stow and deploy conditions this valve must be energised. The DCV controls the flow direction of the high pressure hydraulic fluid once it is in the thrust reverser system. \u2022 The DCV will direct the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to both the stow and deploy sides of the system for deploy conditions. \u2022 The DCV will direct the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow side of the system for stow conditions. The two lower actuators are locking they incorporate proximity sensors to give indication to the EEC of lock and unlock conditions. Flex shaft The four linear motion actuators are kept in synchronisation movement by flexible shafts that have a high torsion resistance. Hydraulic Control Unit The hydraulic control unit comprises of the following items; \u2022 Hydraulic isolation valve (HIV). \u2022 Directional control valve (DCV). Revision 2 Page 15-9 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-10 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Hydraulic Control Unit Purpose The hydraulic control unit (HCU) is designed to control the safe passage of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to the thrust reverser system. \u2022 A filter with a clog indicator that gives a visual indication of the filter condition when it becomes contaminated. Location \u2022 A bleed valve. The HCU is located between the top of the engine fan case and the aircraft strut. Access is gained by opening the left hand side fan cowl door. \u2022 Provision for locking out the valve operation for maintenance and flight. Description The HCU is a self contained LRU designed to control the flow of high pressure hydraulic fluid. The EEC and EIU has control over the HCU control solenoids. When the EEC detects a demand for thrust reverse operation both EEC and EIU will signal the HCU control solenoids. The HCU has the following features; \u2022 A hydraulic isolation valve (HIV) which controls the flow of high-pressure hydraulic fluid into the thrust reverser system. A control solenoid valve controls the HIV function. \u2022 A directional control valve (DCV) which controls the direction of flow of the high-pressure hydraulic fluid to either the deploy or stow sides of the system. A control solenoid valve controls the DCV function. \u2022 A pressure switch to feedback system pressure status to the EEC. Revision 2 Page 15-11 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-12 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Hydraulic Control Unit Operation Deploy When the thrust reverser select levers are moved to the up position the EEC detects that the thrust reverser system is required. \u2022 The EEC has selection control over the HIV. \u2022 The EIU has selection control over the DCV. The HIV control solenoid will be energised. This moves a lockpin away from the pilot valve chamber orifice. High pressure hydraulic fluid enters the left hand side of the chamber and forces the pilot valve to move to the right. The pilot valve moves against a spring that exerts a pressure on the right hand side of the pilot valve. The pilot valve recess moves in line with the hydraulic fluid supply tube. This admits high pressure fluid into the thrust reverse system and initially to the stow side of the system. The pressure switch moves to the high pressure indicating position. The DCV control solenoid will be energised. This moves a lockpin away from the pilot valve chamber orifice. High pressure hydraulic fluid enters the left hand side of the chamber and forces the pilot valve to move to the right. The pilot valve moves against a spring that exerts a pressure on the right hand side of the pilot valve. The pilot valve recess moves in line with the hydraulic fluid supply tube. This admits high pressure fluid into the thrust reverse system deploy side of the system. Thrust Reverser System The restrictors in the deploy supply tube to the DCV delay the pressure build up to the deploy side so the pressure present on the stow side can push the locking actuators towards the stow. This releases the pressure acting on the tine locking mechanism. Stow To stow the thrust reverser the select levers are moved to the down position. \u2022 The EEC has selection control over the HIV. \u2022 The EIU has selection control over the DCV. The DCV control solenoid is de-energised. The pilot valve moves to the right due to spring pressure alone. This leaves high pressure hydraulic fluid present in the stow side of the system. When the thrust reverser system has fully stowed the EEC will sense this by a feedback signal coming from the unlock sensors. The EEC will then de-energise the HIV control solenoid. The control solenoid pilot valve will move to the right due to spring pressure alone and the high pressure hydraulic fluid is cut off from the thrust reverser system. HIV Deactivation The deactivating lever prevents the HIV pilot valve from moving. This prevents high pressure hydraulic fluid from entering the thrust reverser system. There is now pressure present in both the stow and deploy sides of the system.

The lower locking actuators mechanism which gives; \u2022 An acme screw thread that rotates a worm gear. \u2022 A worm wheel that rotates the flex shafts. \u2022 A manual unlocking feature for maintenance purposes. incorporate a locking \u2022 A feedback signal to the EEC of actuator locked or unlocked. \u2022 A means of preventing the translating sleeves from uncommanded movement. Location The lower locking actuators are located in the thrust reverser C duct units at the lower positions. Description The actuators in general control the movement of the translating sleeves in a linear motion. The lower actuators on either thrust reverser C duct have a locking mechanism incorporated in the design. The locking mechanism adds to the safety of the system. The lower locking actuators incorporate the following features; \u2022 Hydraulically operated linear motion actuators. \u2022 A locking mechanism called a tine lock. This can only be unlocked when hydraulic pressure is present in the system. Revision 2 Page 15-15 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-16 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Lower Locking Actuators Operation Deploy Stow The EEC will energise the HIV and DCV control solenoids which allows high pressure hydraulic fluid to be present in the thrust reverser system. This is on the stow and deploy sides. To stow the thrust reverser the high pressure fluid present on the deploy side of the system must be reduced to tank pressure and ported back to the hydraulic reservoir of the aircraft. The restrictor in the pressure feed tube to the deploy side delays the deploy pressure build up enough to allow the stow pressure to initially push the actuator piston towards the stow direction. This releases the lock pressure on the tine locking mechanism. The EEC will de-energise the DCV control solenoid and this will leave high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the system. The unlock sleeve is then pushed towards the right of the tine lock. With the locking sleeve clear of the tine lock the tine lock flexible spring type fingers are free to flex. When the locking sleeve moves a lever assembly also moves. The lever assembly is linked to the external area of the actuator. The lever has a target attached to it. \u2022 When the actuator is at stow the target is in line with the proximity sensor. \u2022 When the actuator is at deploy the target is away from the proximity sensor. The actuator will now move in the stow direction. The head end of the actuator engages into the tine lock. The locking sleeve will move into position to immobilise the tine lock by spring pressure. As the locking sleeve moves to the lock position the target on the unlock indicator moves in line with the proximity sensor. The EEC detects this and sees that the thrust reverser system is stowed. The EEC detects these conditions. High pressure fluid being present in both sides of the system forces the actuator to move towards the deploy direction. This bias of movement exists because the surface area of the deploy side of the pressure plate is greater that the surface area of the stow side.

The upper non locking actuators incorporate a linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) that feeds back translating sleeve status of translation and deployment. The actuators operate in the same manner as the locking actuators. \u2022 For deployment the high pressure hydraulic fluid is present on both sides of the system. \u2022 For stowing the high pressure hydraulic fluid is present on the stow side of the system only. The LVDT monitors the movement of the translating sleeves and feeds back the signals to the EEC. This is done to tell the EEC that the translating sleeves are in transit and when 78% of travel towards the deploy has been achieved.

This is known as the third lock of safety. For normal thrust reverser operation provides a one way directional flow for the hydraulic fluid. The shut off valve has a filter assembly installed in line with the valve. For maintenance purposes it allows the flow of hydraulic fluid easier when manual deployment and stow of the thrust reverser is required. Location Location The shut off valve is located in the aircraft strut at the front. It is behind the HCU. The manual bypass valve is located in the aircraft strut just behind the shut off valve. Description Description The shut off valve has the following features; The manual bypass non return valve allows the flow of hydraulic fluid in one direction only. Control solenoid. Two position valve assembly. Operation The shut off valve operation for opening and closing relies upon the signals from the spoilers and elevators computer (SEC). Pulling up the thrust reverse select levers will signal the SEC to open the shut off valve. There is a very hard spring loaded valve inside that is difficult to unseat when carrying out manual operations of the thrust reverser system. The bypass handle allows the valve to become unseated for maintenance operations only. Access to the bypass valve is through an access panel located on the left hand side of the aircraft strut. The SEC sends a signal to the shut off valve relay. The relay energises the solenoid and opens the shut off valve. The high pressure hydraulic fluid now flows towards the HCU. To close the shut off valve the selection of thrust reverse levers must be in the forward thrust position.

This prevents any one actuator from moving faster than the others. Location The flex shaft is located within the deploy tube system. Description The flex shaft system comprises of the following; T piece housing assembly. This allows the distribution of high pressure hydraulic fluid to both sides of the thrust reverser system. Two flexible tubes. This allows the crossover shaft to link the reverser halves together while allowing the C ducts to be opened. Two rigid tubes. These are found between the upper and lower actuators. They carry hydraulic fluid to the deploy side of the system. Three flexible shafts. These link all the actuators together. Note: The two deploy tubes have a telescopic coupling at one end to permit simple removal and installation without disturbing the actuators.

Location The cascades are located between the inner and outer translating sleeve sleeves. They are mounted on the fixed section of the C ducts. Description There are 16 cascades fitted to the thrust reverser system. The cascades are designed to direct the fan air forwards thus providing for the function of the thrust reverse system. They are designed to direct the fan air away from the ground thus reducing the risk of debris from being blown up and ingested into the engine. They are designed to direct the fan air away from the airframe thus not inducing any unnecessary stress upon the airframe itself.

Thrust Reverser System a signal from the proximity sensor of reverser system unlocked. In the flight deck this unlocked condition is identified as an amber coloured REV caption on the EPR indicating gauge. When the translating sleeves have moved to 78% of the full deploy position the amber REV indication will change to a green REV indication. When green REV is indicated the full reverse thrust power is available to the flight crew. Deploy Stow Pulling up on the thrust reverse select lever in the flight deck will send a signal for thrust reverse select to the EEC and EIU. This will also put the main throttles in the reverse thrust quadrant. To stow the thrust reverse system the flight crew will return the throttles to the idle detent position and select levers to the down position. This will put the throttles back to the forward thrust quadrant. The EEC will look for the following conditions before thrust reverse will be allowed; The DCV solenoid will be de-energised as commanded by the EEC via the EIU inhibit relay. This will leave high pressure hydraulic fluid present on the stow side of the reverser system only. \u2022 The EEC will check that the aircraft is on the ground by checking the LGCU signal of the aircraft computers. \u2022 The EEC will check that the engine is running by means of a N2 signal. \u2022 The EIU will look for the signal from the throttle control unit for energising of the inhibit relay. \u2022 The SEC signal for opening the shut off valve. The hydraulic isolation valve solenoid and the directional control valve solenoid will both be energised for a deploy condition. This will admit high pressure hydraulic fluid to the stow and deploy sides of the thrust reverse system. As the translating sleeves move from deploy back to stow the flight deck indication will change from green to amber on the REV indication. When the thrust reverser has reached the fully stowed position the amber REV will go and the EPR gauge will return to normal indication. This will indicate that the thrust reverser is fully stowed and locked. The lower locking actuators will unlock and the EEC sees Revision 2 Page 15-27 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Revision 2 Thrust Reverser System Page 15-28 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 IAE V2500 Line and Base Maintenance Thrust Reverser System Thrust Reverser Maintenance The thrust reverser system is precisely adjusted to ensure correct alignment and load sharing between the nacelle components and the engine.

This is as advised by the MMEL requirements for single thrust reverser operation. In addition to the procedure for deactivation for maintenance the thrust reverser system can be locked out for flight. Thrust Reverser Deactivation for Maintenance Thrust Reverser Deactivation for Flight Warning In addition to the deactivation procedure for the HCU the translating sleeve can be secured in the stow position by inserting a lockout pin through each translating sleeve and the fixed section of the C duct assembly. Do not cause a blockage of the hydraulic control unit (HCU) return port to deactivate the HCU.

The most common and straightforward menu selection is 'Trouble Shooting Procedures'. If the user were to select 'Trouble Shooting Manual', this would require the user to insert a known trouble shooting task reference number in order to progress. Having acquired the knowledge of various engine systems functionality and operation during this course, we are now in a position to take the course the natural step forward and discuss the all-important methodology of isolating and identifying the source of a problem. Unless a procedural task has been already identified during previous investigation activity it will not be practical to use, as its selection would be dependent knowing which system has the fault. An important tool available to the engineer is the A319/A320/A321 'Computer Assisted Aircraft Trouble Shooting' (CAATS) CD-ROM. This valuable aid provides the user with an enormous amount of detail and information. Below is a screen shot showing the opening menu options and for the purpose of these training notes we are using 'British Midland' as the 'Log on Airline'. This manual is revised and issued every three months. Upon receipt and installation of the up-dated version the previous version is automatically overwritten and the previous disc is now no longer valid or useable. The CAATS CD-ROM is password protected for each airline, as it is tailored specifically for each operator's requirements. Therefore it is essential that the user always access the procedures for their own particular airline. After inserting the correct password the user is presented with the screen shot below. Revision 2 Page 16-1 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 V2500 Maintenance Special Revision 2 Troubleshooting Page 16-2 \u00a9 IAE International Aero Engines AG 2000 V2500 Maintenance Special Troubleshooting IAE V2500 Troubleshooting Introduction continued: Upon selecting 'Trouble Shooting Procedures' the user is then presented with the screen shot (fig. 1) shown below. These are generally of a 'Class 1' level which would prevent the aircraft from being dispatched unless the problem and source of the message had been rectified. Check Minimum Equipment List (MEL). 2. ECAM STATUS (Inoperative Maintenance Status). Systems and The presence of an ECAM Status Message 'STS' is automatically displayed on the Upper ECAM Screen during Flight phase 1 (Electrical Power 'on' before first engine start) and Flight Phase 10 (When the second engine has been shut down after the flight). It is used to highlight a problem or degradation in the built in redundancy facility of the FADEC System. This feature prevents un-wanted distractions of system degradation being shown to the pilot during the flight. A fault of this nature is dispatchable and the fault can be left un-rectified for up to ten days. Fig.1 Check Minimum Equipment List (MEL) the Status Page can then be selected by pressing the STS button on the Systems Page Select Panel. This will then provide information under the 'Maintenance' heading regarding the failure, for example ENG 1(2) FADEC or ENG 1 (2) EIU. From this menu it is possible to enter into the trouble shooting process with information derived from a variety of sources: 3. 4. ECAM WARNINGS: These are the messages that appeared on the Upper ECAM Screen during operation and show the symptom or system, which has been degraded by a fault.

CFDS FAULT MESSAGE Centralised Fault Display System (CFDS) This menu selection is one of the most common methods of entering into the Trouble Shooting process. By interpreting the information provided on the Post Flight Report (PFR) and completing the necessary data field boxes, the user can quickly locate the appropriate Trouble Shooting task for this particular systems problem. Completing the Class of Failure data can make further refinement of identifying the task. In this case we had an upper ECAM warning message, so in this example we can identify it as a 'Class 1' fault. In this example we have a problem with the Number 2 Engine's Fuel Heat Management System. This message appeared on the upper ECAM as an 'ECAM WARNING' this is a Class 1 failure and is not dispatchable. The CFDS Fault Message is the text contained under the heading 'FAILURE MESSAGES' on the Post Flight Report. Again, in this example the Failure Message that is linked to the Upper ECAM 'ENG 2 FUEL HEAT SYS' is: 'FUL DIV RET VLV/HC/EEC2' This text along with the ATA reference number: '73-13-42' and the Source: 'EIU2FAD' is copied into the text boxes as shown on (fig. 6) opposite.

The MMEL can be used as a basis for particular operators own MEL. The MEL should be used to establish dispatchability for a particular operation. The item is then either repaired or may be deferred as per the MEL or other approved means acceptable to the Administrator prior to further operation. The MEL does not include those items that are obviously required for aircraft safety, such as wings, engines etc. The MEL does not include those items that do not affect the airworthiness of the aircraft, such as galley equipment, entertainment system etc. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) Repair Intervals Note; All items, which are related to the airworthiness of the aircraft and not included in the list, are automatically required to operational for each flight. MEL Preamble The MEL is intended to permit operation with inoperative items of equipment for a period of time, until repairs can be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. In order to maintain acceptable levels of safety and reliability the MEL establishes limitations on the duration of and conditions for operation with inoperative equipment. When an item of equipment is discovered to be inoperative, it is reported by making an entry into the Aircraft Maintenance Record/Logbook as prescribed by the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Revision 2 MEL conditions and limitations do not relieve the operator from determining that the aircraft is in a condition for safe operation with items of equipment inoperative. All users of an approved MEL, must effect repairs of inoperative systems or components, deferred in accordance with the MEL, at or prior to the repair times established by the following letter designators: \u2022 Category A: To be repaired within the time interval specified in the remarks column of the operator's approved MEL. \u2022 Category B: To be repaired within three (3) consecutive calendar days (72 hours), excluding the day the malfunction occurred. \u2022 Category C: To be repaired within ten (10) consecutive calendar days), excluding the day the malfunction occurred. \u2022 Category D: To be repaired within one hundred and twenty (120) days), excluding the day the malfunction occurred.

The EEC checks the input signal from a feedback device for range and rate of change. This test is only carried out on the input signal to the EEC. Clear Language Message (CLM) ATA ACRONYM VSVA ACT/HC/EEC# 753241 SVAL Stator Vane Actuator 'Input Latch Failed'. Wraparound Failure (XXXWAF) A detected failure in the circuitry of a system. The EEC checks the system for continuity. This test is only carried out on an EEC output circuit. A complete list of fault code acronyms can be found in the CAATS program by selecting 'Supporting Data' and after selecting an appropriate aircraft 'tail' number for your airline. Typing in the following ATA Reference; 73-00-00-301 into the 'Type Known Data' boxes. You will then be able to view a description of over 250 Fault Code Acronyms. Note; The devices that are associated with wraparound faults are solenoids, torque motor windings and micro-switches. Clear Language Message (CLM) ATA ACRONYM VSVA ACT/HC/EEC# 753241 SVAWAF Stator Vane Actuator 'Wraparound Fault. Note; By definition the failure message will be set in 'both' channels i.e. If 'channel A' feedback is not equal to 'channel B' then by default 'channel B' is not equal to 'channel A'.
