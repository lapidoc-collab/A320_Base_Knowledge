COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW - RADIO
COMMUNICATION The communications system of the single aisle aircraft has
two sub-systems: - radio communication, - on-board communication. The
radio communication systems are used for communications to and from the
aircraft. The radio communication system is used for the communication
of the crew with ground stations and with other aircraft through VHF
Data Radio (VDR), High Frequency Data Radio (HFDR) and SATCOM if
installed. The VHF transceivers are the same and interchangeable. The HF
transceivers are also the same and interchangeable. VDR 1 and VDR 2 are
usually used by the flight crew for voice communications. VDR 3 is used
for Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) functions and as back-up voice
communications if there is a failure of system 1 or 2. The HF
transceivers are used when the aircraft is not in the applicable range
of the VHF radios.

RADIO MANAGEMENT PANEL INTERFACES (3) RADIO
FMGC
Radio Management Panel (RMP) 1 and RMP 2 have two ARINC 429 data buses
connected to the radio communication transceivers (XCVRs): - COM BUS 1
delivers the VHF 1 frequency, - COM BUS 2 delivers the VHF 2 frequency.
Three dialog buses are used for the exchange of information between the
three RMPs. Each RMP periodically transmits its context on its dialog
bus. Each RMP can control any radio XCVR but is more particularly
dedicated to one system. Basic allocation: - RMP 1 VHF 1, - RMP 2 VHF 2.
Possible allocation (depending on options): - RMP 3 HF 1, HF 2 and VHF
3.
In normal operation, the navigation systems are tuned automatically or
manually from the MCDUs by the FMGCs via internal relays of the onside
RMPs. The RMP is thus transparent to the onside FMGC. In case of failure
of one FMGC, the onside navigation systems are tuned directly by the
remaining FMGC.
The BITE functions of the system are available through the Centralized
Fault Display System (CFDS).
LGCIU In order to increment the fault memories in case of Centralized
Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) failure, each RMP receives a
discrete giving the landing gear configuration. RMP 1 receives this
discrete from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1, and RMP
2 and 3 from LGCIU 2.
NOTE: Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) uses VHF 3 for data transmission.
NAVIGATION If the standby navigation mode is selected, the navigation
systems frequencies are controlled by RMP 1 and RMP 2 only. The standby
navigation is selected in the event of failure of both Flight Management
and Guidance Computers (FMGCs). In this condition: - RMP 1 controls VOR
1, Automatic Direction Finder 1 (ADF) and Instrument Landing System 1
(ILS) and 2, - RMP 2 controls VOR 2, ADF 2 and ILS 1 and 2. For ILS
functions, Multi-Mode Receivers (MMRs) 1 and 2 always operate on the
same frequency which can be controlled from any RMP, either directly or
through the cross talk bus.

CFDIU
RMP FAILURE The system architecture gives access to all communication
functions in case of failure of any RMP. A RMP failure is indicated by
the blanking of the display windows. If a failure occurs, the failed RMP
has to be switched off. When selected off, the RMP sends a discrete
signal for system reconfiguration.

COCKPIT LOUDSPEAKER MUTING CIRCUIT D/O (3) MUTING CIRCUIT Each crew
station, CAPT, F/O and 3rd occupant, has the direct muting function
managed by the Audio Management Unit (AMU). A muting circuit is
installed to avoid acoustic coupling between the loudspeakers and the
microphones. When a transmission is keyed by any push to talk switch, a
ground signal is delivered to the two loudspeaker amplifiers. This
ground signal decreases the gain and band-pass of the loudspeaker
amplifiers. NOTE: This attenuating circuit is not operative with the
Flight Warning Computer (FWC) audio outputs.

HF SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE D/O (3) RMP
CFDS
The Radio Management Panel (RMP) controls the tuning operations which
are transmitted to the transceiver (XCVR) by a numeric message in
compliance with ARINC 429. This message can be received by the port A or
the port B of the XCVR. The RMP does this selection by a discrete. The
message can be made of one word of 32 bits or two words of 32 bits for
the 1KHz or 100 Hz spacing (pin prog). A microprocessor does the
decoding of the frequency selected and mode: Upper Side Band (USB) or
Amplitude Modulation (AM).
For maintenance purposes, BITE is integrated in the HF XCVR. The BITE
functions of the HF XCVR are monitored by the Centralized Fault Display
System (CFDS).
SDAC The connection between the HF XCVR and the System Data Acquisition
Concentrator (SDAC) lets the use of the HF system in transmission mode
be recorded. The connection is obtained through the Push To Talk (PTT)
switch. In case of continuous emitting during more than one minute, the
ECAM displays in amber: COM: HF 1/2 EMITTING.
AMU The HF system is linked to the Audio Management Unit (AMU) for
connection to the audio integrating and SELective CALling system. The
Audio Control Panels (ACPs) are used for HF transmission or reception
selection mode and control of the received audio signal levels through
the AMU.
LGCIU The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) indicates the
flight or ground status of the aircraft. This information is used by the
HF BITE, in order to count the flight legs in case of Centralized Fault
Display Interface Unit failure (CFDIU).

VHF SYSTEM D/O (3) VHF TRANSCEIVER
LGCIU
The Very High Frequency (VHF) system is used for all short-range voice
communications between different aircraft in flight or between the
aircraft and ground stations. Optionally, aircraft can have the VHF Data
Link (VDL) system, to communicate via the data mode, in addition to the
voice mode.
The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) indicates the flight
or ground aircraft status. This information is used by the VHF BITE, in
order to count the flight legs in case of Centralized Fault Display
Interface Unit (CFDIU) failure.
RMP The Radio Management Panels (RMPs) are used for VHF frequency
control and display. The VHF transceiver has 2 serial input ports :
Serial input port A for normal use and serial input port B in case of
RMP failure. The port selection is done through the discrete port
selection information signal. The selected frequency information sent to
the VHF system is a serial 32 bit word. The VHF requires one serial 32
bit word for complete tuning data.
CFDS For maintenance purposes, a BITE is integrated in the VHF
transceiver. The BITE functions of the VHF transceiver are monitored by
the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).
SDAC The System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC) acquires the VHF
Push To Talk (PTT) signal and sends this information to the ECAM and the
Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR). In case of continuous emitting, the
ECAM displays: - COM: VHF 1/2 EMITTING.
AMU The VHF system is linked to the Audio Management Unit (AMU) for
connection to the audio integrating and SELective CALling (SELCAL)
systems. The Audio Control Panels (ACPs) are used for VHF transmission
or reception selection mode and control of the received audio signal
levels through the AMU.

SELCAL AND COCKPIT CALL SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The SELective CALling
(SELCAL) and CALL functions are done in the Audio Management Unit (AMU)
by the SELCAL/CALL card. This card receives SELCAL calls from the ground
stations via the communication channels, a SELCAL code from the SELCAL
code panel, calls from the ground crew and the attendant stations and
sends visual and aural warnings.
SELCAL OPERATION The SELCAL/CALL card has 7 inputs connected to the
communication receiver SELCAL outputs. These inputs are permanently
scanned, and when a SELCAL signal is present, a comparison is made with
the code programmed on the SELCAL code panel. When the 2 codes agree, a
message is sent to the various Audio Control Panels (ACPs), via the
corresponding audio cards. On the ACPs, the CALL light, corresponding to
the communication channel used, flashes amber. At the same time, data is
sent to the Flight Warning Computers (FWCs). The FWCs send an audio call
buzzer to the loudspeakers. The call is cancelled using the RESET key on
one ACP, or selecting the called channel and activating the Push To Talk
(PTT).

ATTENDANT CALL When a call is made from a cabin attendant station, the
Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) generates ground information
to the SELCAL/CALL card and to the FWC. During one second, the FWC
activates the buzzer signal through the loudspeakers. The SELCAL/CALL
card sends a signal through the various audio cards to the ACPs. The
ATTendant legend flashes for 60 seconds on the ACPs. The visual call is
automatically cancelled and the circuit reinitialized after 60 seconds
or when the RESET pushbutton is pressed in, on any ACP. Information is
also sent to the CIDS for re-initialization. The automatic reset may be
cancelled with the AMU pin programming.

STATIC DISCHARGING PRESENTATION (2) PURPOSE The aircraft behaves like a
Faraday cage and should be discharged. The static dischargers avoid
static electricity discharging noise and ensure a good quality of radio
transmission, without interference. The purpose of the static
dischargers is: - to discharge the static electricity accumulated by the
aircraft during its flight, - to supply better intelligibility on the HF
and VHF system (avoid static electricity discharge noise).

SATCOM D/O (3) SATCOM PRESENTATION The function of the SATCOM system is
the reception and processing of signals via satellites to supply
aeronautical services in the L-Band. Aero-H+-HSD SATCOM lets the
aircraft fly in the spot beam coverage to transmit and receive
multichannel voice, fax, e-mail and circuit mode data services. Packet
mode data services and emergency calls are available world-wide in the
global beam. The system Aero-H+-HSD SATCOM includes: - a Satellite Data
Unit (SDU), - a High Speed Data Unit (HSDU), a second HSDU is
optional, - a splitter, - an attenuator, - a High Gain Antenna (HGA).
The SDU is the interface to other aircraft systems. It contains all data
processing functions. It also contains the modems, channel tuning
synthesizers, high-stability reference oscillator, to/from intermediate
frequency to/from L-band conversion and the High Power Amplifier (HPA)
used to amplify the SDU-generated L-band signal to a power level
necessary for correct transmission to the satellite.
SDU The SDU is the primary system of the SATCOM system. It does most of
the data-handling, protocol, modulation/coding and demodulation/decoding
functions of the Aircraft Earth Station (AES). The SDU is connected
to: - the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS) to send the
relative azimuth and relative elevation command to the Beam Steering
Unit (BSU) to point the steerable beam of the HGA for best reception and
transmission, - the Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) for
BITE, - the Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) when the VHF link with
ground station is not possible,

CATTS LTD
-   the Cabin Telecommunication Unit (CTU) for the cabin/passenger
    telecommunications equipment to get the best performance from the
    resources supplied by the SATCOM,
-   the MCDUs to display call status information and system
    configuration information for the SDU,
-   the Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit (MDDU) installed on the pedestal
    and used to up/download software,
-   the Flight Warning Computer (FWC), to send warnings and cautions
    during the flight,
-   the Audio Management Unit (AMU) to make audio transmission (the
    calls are started with the related SATCOM channel SAT 1 or SAT 2
    transmission key on the Audio Control Panel (ACP)),
-   the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) to transmit
    air/ground information discrete outputs. The RF signal is sent to
    the HPA through an attenuator and it is received from the
    Diplexer/Low Noise Amplifier (D/LNA).
HSDU The HSDU supplies one channel at a maximum data rate of 64 kb/s.
The HSDU gives two communication services (also known as Swift64): - the
Mobile-Integrated Services Digital Network (M-ISDN) for communications
charged by minutes of connection, - the Mobile Packet Data Services
(MPDS) for communications charged by the number of bits transmitted.
HGA The high gain antenna is an electronically steerable phased array.
Simultaneous transmission and reception of satellite signals (full
duplex operation) supplies two bands of operation: receive (Rx) band and
transmit (Tx) band. Beam steering of the antenna is done via serial
transmission of phase shifter data from the D/LNA unit.
Issue 012 - Revision 001 - Dated 27/06/2024 Page 42 of 232
FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY
The HGA supplies +12 dBic nominal gain with near hemispherical coverage
and can be used for the transmission of high-rate data and voice
communications. A SATCOM antenna subsystem includes these components: -
a D/LNA which supplies the first stage of amplification and filtering
before the signals are sent to the SDU in reception mode, - a
splitter, - an attenuator, - a HGA (installed on top).

SATCOM D/O (3) BITE With the CFDS, the SATCOM system faults can be
displayed on the MCDU and can be printed on the printer. The CFDIU has
two operating modes: - normal mode: during the normal mode, the BITE
monitors the status of the SATCOM cards in cycles and transmits this
data to the CFDIU during the flight. If a fault is detected, the BITE
stores the information in the fault memory, - menu mode: this mode is
used for communication between the CFDIU and the SATCOM BITE through the
MCDU. The BITE test can only be started on the ground.

CVR OPERATIONAL MODES D/O (3) and L main landing gear shock absorbers
compressed and parking brake applied.
NORMAL MODE The A/C has a Solid State CVR (SSCVR) which records into a
memory block unit. In normal mode, the CVR records, on four independent
channels, the audio signals from the CAPT, F/O and 3rd occupant through
the Audio Management Unit (AMU). Channel 4 records the ambient noise
picked up by the area microphone and supplied through a pre-amplifier to
the CVR. The CVR is automatically supplied when the aircraft is in one
of the configurations given below: - in flight with engines in operation
or stopped, - on the ground with one engine or more in operation, - on
the ground during the first five minutes after energization of the
aircraft electrical network, - on the ground until a maximum of five
minutes after the second engine shutdown. The CVR is qualified in 115VAC
and 28VDC power supply and it can thus be installed on aircraft that
obey European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulation (115VAC) or
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation (28VDC).
NOTE: If the engines are shut down, the CVR must first be energized by
pressing the GND CTL P/B on the RCDR panel.
TEST MODE
NOTE: The CVR can be supplied manually. To do this, push the
ReCorDeR/GrouND ConTroL P/BSW.
ERASE MODE
SOLID STATE CVR The Push-to-Test function is activated using a discrete
input of the SSCVR (activated using a pushbutton RCDR/CVR TEST switch
5RK installed on the overhead panel). The discrete must be activated for
a minimum of five seconds to activate this function. Once activated,
this function has an extensive set of functional tests to determine the
integrity of the system. A successful self-test results in the status
discrete output being activated once. This results in the activation of
the status LED (whichever is shown) on the SSCVR. In addition to the
visual indication, an aural indication is given through the audio
monitor output received at the CVR/HEAD SET JACK (on the maintenance
panel 50VU). Or, at the two loud speakers a 600 Hz tone is sent to
indicate successful self-test. A 800 Hz tone is sent to the headset jack
and the loud speakers for aural indication. NOTE: Prior to this test,
the CVR must be energized by pressing the GND CTL P/B with the engines
not running.
SOLID STATE CVR The RCDR CVR ERASE P/B must be pressed for a minimum of
0.5 s to activate the erase function. Once activated, this function
disables the ability to download the previously recorded data from the
Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) using the normal download function.
A 400 Hz tone is sent through the audio monitor to indicate a successful
erase. Erase is only possible, aircraft on the ground, R

FAA/CAA OPTION A jumper strap installed on the AMU enables Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) /Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recording
selection. In FAA mode, all the communications heard by the crewmembers
are recorded. This is obtained by the recording of side-tone signal:
Audio output. This lets, at the same time record all the communications
sent out by these crewmembers. In CAA mode, the CAPT, F/O, 3rd occupant
boomset microphones are "HOT" at all times for voice/noise pick-up to
reinforce the sounds picked-up by the area mike. The mask microphones
circuits are open until the oxygen pressure switch is closed. The hand
microphones are only "HOT" when the Push-To-Talk (PTT) switch on the
microphone is activated. However, in CAA mode, as in FAA mode, the
signal received in the crew's earphones is recorded on the CVR.

EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The Emergency
Locator Transmitter (ELT) function is to transmit distress signals. The
ELT system transmits on 3 frequencies: 121.5 MHz (Civil) and 243 MHz
(Military) homing-signals, and 406 MHz to the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite
system. The battery-pack, installed in the ELT housing, supplies the
power to operate the system. The satellite system transmits the 406 MHz
distress signal to a Local User Terminal (LUT), when the LUT is in
range. The LUT receiving range is a radius of approximately 2.500 km
(1367.00 NM). When the LUT is not in receiving range, the satellite
system stores the distress signal until transmission is possible. The
LUT automatically processes the distress signal to identify and show the
position of the aircraft to a radius of approximately 1.8 km (5900 ft).
The processed data is transmitted to a Mission Control Center (MCC). The
MCC sends the data to an applicable Rescue Coordination Center (RCC),
where Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are started. The 121.5 MHz and
243 MHz signals are used to find the aircraft in the final stage of SAR
operation.
ELT DESCRIPTION The ELT system includes these components: - An ELT, - An
Aircraft Identification Module (AIM), - A Remote Control Panel (RCP), -
An antenna, installed on the upper external fuselage between FRame 64
and FR65, - An indicator, - A horn.
-   An electronic unit,
-   A battery pack,
-   An interface,
-   A connector. The electronic unit and the battery-pack are kept in
    the housing. The electronic unit has two different G-switches
    installed (North American and European). The battery-pack is made of
    five lithium batteries connected together. You can get access to the
    battery-pack through a cover on the attachment side of the ELT. The
    cover is installed with screws. The interface includes:
-   An ARM/OFF/TX switch,
-   An antenna connector,
-   An RCP connector,
-   An indicator. The connector is installed on the back end of the ELT
    (against flight direction), and connects directly to the AIM. The
    RCP connector is used to connect an RCP, or a Beacon Message
    Programmer (BMP). The ELT is programmable to one of the five
    approved protocols:
-   Serialized Aviation User Protocol,
-   Aviation User Protocol,
-   24 bit Aircraft Address Number,
-   Aircraft Operator Designator Number and Serial Number,
-   Serial Number Protocol.

EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER SYSTEM D/O (3) REMOTE CONTROL PANEL
ELT OPERATION
The RCP operates the ELT from a different location in the aircraft. The
RCP can: - Manually start ELT operation (if the ELT ARM/OFF/TX switch is
set to the ARMED position), - Reset ELT operation to the ARMED mode
(this is not applicable when the ELT ARM/OFF/TX switch is set to the TX
position), - Start and monitor a BITE test. The ON-ARMED-TEST/RESET
switch has these functions: - Set to the ON position for manual
operation of the ELT. You must lift the switch guard to set the switch
to the ON position, - Set to the ARMED position for automatic operation
of the ELT. The switch is kept in the ARMED position by a switch guard.
The switch guard stops accidental operation of the ELT, - Set to the
TEST/RESET position to start an ELT BITE test, or to reset ELT operation
to the ARMED mode. Set the switch to the TEST/RESET position for not
longer than 2 seconds to start a BITE test. The ON indicator comes on
when the ELT operates, or to give the BITE test result. During ELT
transmission the indicator slowly flashes continuously.
EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER The ELT operates automatically or
manually. The battery-pack supplies the power to operate the ELT. The
signal transmission can continue for approximately fifty hours. The
three-position switch controls three modes: - OFF mode: there is no
power available from the battery-pack and the ELT circuits are not
energized. The ELT cannot detect a crash or transmit rescue signals. You
cannot operate a BITE test in this mode, - ARMED mode: the necessary
circuits are energized and the ELT can detect a start signal from the
G-switch, the RCP or the ELT ARM/OFF/TX switch. After the signal is
received, the ELT switches to transmit mode. You can operate a BITE test
in this mode. There are 3 different types of operation in the armed
mode: - Automatic operation occurs when the G-switch detects an impact
sufficient to start the transmit mode, - Manual operation occurs when
you need to transmit a signal (aircraft out of operation, injured
passengers/crew members), or when you do a BITE test, - Accidental
operation occurs when the ELT is connected to its system in the A/C and
the G-switch starts transmission without a real emergency (hard
landing). - Transmit mode: the ELT starts to transmit 121.5/243 MHz and
406 MHz signals to the antenna.
AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION MODULE The AIM automatically programs the 406
MHz message in the ELT with one of the different message protocols.
During an ELT BITE test the AIM transmits this aircraft identification
code to the ELT. After the data transfer occurs the AIM verifies that
the data was transmitted correctly. You can also program the AIM with a
NULL message that will not reprogram the ELT.

CIDS DIRECTOR DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
FUNCTIONS
For redundancy, the system has two identical directors (DIRs). In normal
operation, DIR 1 is active and DIR 2 is in hot stand-by. DIR 2 receives
and computes the same data as DIR 1 but its outputs are disabled when
director1 is available. The director commands cabin equipment via
Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs). The cargo smoke system is linked by
Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. The Flight Attendant Panel (FAP) is
linked by ethernet buses. Each DIR is separated in two parts: - the DIR
main functions with the integrated Vacuum System Control (VSC)
function, - the smoke detection board. Both parts work independently
with segregated hardware and software. System reconfiguration for the
installation of options, cabin reconfiguration or Cabin
Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) expansion is limited to software
database changes. These databases are the On Board Replaceable Module
(OBRM) and Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The CIDS is also designed to
detect internal and external faults. The CIDS is a Type 1 system. The
DIRs are connected by ARINC data buses to the Centralized Fault Display
System (CFDS) for maintenance purposes. In the normal mode, the SerViCE
BUS supplies the FAP (with the optional power supply with CIDS A318
type, the FAP is supplied by the HOT BAT BUS), all DIRs, and all DEUs
with 28V DC. The system operates at full capacity. In the emergency
mode, only the ESSential BUS supplies 28V DC to the CIDS. The type A
DEUs, which are connected to the top lines, are then only supplied with
power when a Passenger Address (PA) signal is present. If there is no PA
signal, the DIR operates the top line cut-off relays to stop the power
supply to the DEUs.
The DIR is a central control and interface component of the CIDS. The
current cabin layout and properties of layout related equipment are
stored in the DIRs. The DIR provides the following functions: - the
transmission of digitized audio signals, - the transmission of control
data and commands, - the adaptation of received DEU data, - the control
of other CIDS functional units, - the control of the FAP, - the data
transfer to the Passenger Entertainment System (PES), - the service
interphone system, - the control of the Additional Attendant Panel (AAP)
via type B DEUs, - the interface to cockpit and avionics compartment, -
the handling of cabin systems related inputs and outputs, - the control
and interface of other systems, - the realization of programming
functions, - the realization of test functions, - the activation of
emergency mode with minimum power consumption.

when there is an audio signal. If there is no audio signal, the director
operates the Top Line cut-off relay to stop the power supply to the
DEUs. NOTE: The AIPs and the ACPs are also unserviceable because they
receive SVCE BUS power from the type B DEUs.

energization or reset, all DIR interfaces are disabled and the DIRs are
initialized (self-test). The self-test is repeated periodically. It also
includes a test of the data bus lines. The power connections are
arranged such that DIR 1 is normally fully active and in control of the
CIDS. DIR 2 is in a hot-standby mode. A failure in the initialization
process in DIR 1 causes a deactivation of the DIR 1 hardware and a
switchover of control to DIR 2. If the self-test of DIR 1 fails, DIR 2
takes over. At the same time, the power transfer relay is de-energized.
This prepares DIR 2 to be supplied from the ESS BUS in abnormal or
emergency mode.

CIDS TYPE A DEU DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
TOP LINE DATA BUS
Top line data buses link the directors (DIRs) to type A Decoder/Encoder
Units (DEUs) for passenger related functions. One twisted pair of cable
on each cabin side connects all type A DEUs installed on the same side.
One top line data bus on each side of the passenger cabin connect the
type A DEUs to the directors. Top lines are bi-directional serial
high-speed data buses.
FUNCTIONS
NOTE: Note: The last connection box on the top line includes a bus
termination resistor for impedance matching.
The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) uses each type A DEU to
control cabin lighting, signs and cabin loudspeakers according to cabin
parameters programmed in the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The
passenger functions are centralized in the Passenger Service Unit (PSU).
The Passenger Interface and Supply Adapter (PISA) is the PSU interface
with the DEU A. A PISA is integrated into each PSU. Each DEU can control
up to 6 PISAs or stand alone PISAs. One PISA interfaces with: - reading
light switches and Light Emitting Diode (LED) reading lights, -
passenger call buttons and call lights/seat row numbering lights, -
loudspeakers, - No Smoking (NS) and Fasten Seat Belt (FSB) signs. One
stand alone PISA interfaces with: - loudspeaker, - NS, FSB signs -
Attendant work lights. Each type A DEU interfaces with: - PISAs and STA
PISAs, - loudspeakers, - fluorescents strips and ballasts units, - NS
and FSB signs.
CONNECTION BOX Each connection box is connected to a DEU. It gives the
DEU its own address by the two coding switches. This method enables
replacement of DEUs without selecting their address.
CIDS POWER-UP When the CIDS is powered-up or reset, the DIR follows a
power-up routine. This includes the initialization and testing of each
DEU and connected equipment. The test results are transmitted to the DIR
which compares them with its programmed data to decide on their status.
At least 95 % of possible DEU failures are automatically detected.
FAIL SAFE OPERATION A broken wire in one top-line bus will only affect
the type A DEUs behind the crack on this bus. The sound level of the
operable top line is increased to make sure that the Passenger Address
(PA) distribution is fulfilled for the other (not operable) top line
side. An open circuit disables all DEUs after the break in the line.
EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS All DEUs operate in emergency mode when the DC
SerViCE bus is no longer powered. The DEUs are then supplied from the DC
ESSential

CIDS TYPE B DEU DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL Middle line data buses
link the directors (DIRs) to type B Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs) for
cabin crew related functions. One twisted pair of cable on each cabin
side, above the ceiling, connects all type B DEUs installed on the same
side.
FUNCTIONS Up to 8 type B DEUs can be installed in the cabin. The Cabin
Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) uses each type B DEU to control
the different devices needed by the cabin crew and the aircraft systems.
The Attendant Indication Panels (AIPs), located in the cabin crew
stations, indicate (in written form) Passenger Address (PA), INTerPHone
(INTPH) and other system information to the cabin crew. The Additional
Attendant Panel (AAP), located in the aft cabin, to remote control of
light, evac and reset. The switch panel located adjacent to the middle
RH and exit RH attendant station, gives indication of the EVAC alert, on
reset of acoustic and visual EVAC alert indications related to the
respective attendant station, or reset of all acoustic and visual
lavatory smoke warnings. The Area Call Panels (ACPs) located on the
ceiling near the cabin crew stations, draw the cabin crew attention by
colored lights. Each cabin crew station has a handset for passenger
address and interphone functions. The following equipments are connected
to type B DEUs: - drain mast control unit, - Emergency Power Supply
Units (EPSUs), - slide and door sensors, - call lights, - lavatory smoke
detectors, - waste service panel, - potable water service panel, - flush
control unit, - Liquid Level Sensor (LLS),

-   Liquid Level Transmitter (LLT),
-   potable water quantity transmitter,
-   vacuum generator overheat signal.
MIDDLE LINE DATA BUS One middle line data bus on each side of the
passenger cabin connects the type B DEUs to the DIRs. Note that the last
connection box on the middle line includes a bus termination resistor
for impedance matching. Middle lines are bi-directional serial
high-speed data buses.
CONNECTION BOX Each connection box is connected to a DEU. It gives the
DEU its own address by the two coding switches. This method enables
replacement of DEUs without selecting their address.
CIDS POWER-UP When the CIDS is powered-up or reset, the DIR follows a
power-up routine. This includes the initialization and testing of each
DEU and connected equipment. The test results are transmitted to the DIR
which compares them with its programmed data to decide on their status.
At least 95 % of possible DEU failures are automatically detected.
FAIL SAFE OPERATION A failure of one middle line disables all cabin crew
functions in the middle line side.
EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS All DEUs operate in emergency mode when the DC
SerViCE bus is no longer powered. The DEUs are then supplied from the DC
ESSential bus. The type A DEU PA circuits and type B DEU INTPH circuits
remain operational.

PASSENGER ADDRESS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION (3) GENERAL
PRIORITY
The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) directors (DIRs) accept
audio signals from the various Passenger Address (PA) sources in the
aircraft. The active DIR assigns priorities to each source. It transmits
the signal in digital form via the two top-line data buses to the type A
Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs) and, optionally via the Passenger
Entertainment System Main Multiplexer (PESMMUX), to each Passenger
Control Unit (PCU). The type A DEUs send the signal to the cabin
loudspeakers for broadcasting. The announcements can be heard, at each
passenger seat, with a headset.
The basic levels of priority are the following ones: - 1st priority:
Flight compartment, - 2nd priority: Cabin attendant stations, - 3rd
priority: Prerecorded announcement, - 4th priority: BGM and/or
entertainment system (if installed). As an option the FWD attendant
station could have the 2nd level of priority, in this case the other
attendant stations will have the 3rd level of priority. The levels of
priority and the defined options are programmed in the Cabin Assignment
Module (CAM) flash card integrated into the FAP.
SOURCES A PA announcement can be manually initiated from the cockpit and
from the cabin. The announcement from the cockpit can be initiated
with: - the cockpit handset, - other equipment: handmic, boomset mic,
oxygen-mask mic in conjunction with the Audio Control Panels (ACPs), -
the No Smoking (NS) (or optionally EXIT) and Fasten Seat Belts (FSB)
switches set to ON. The announcement from the cabin can be initiated
with: - the attendant handsets, - the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP); from
which the prerecorded announcements, stored in the PRerecorded
Announcement and Music (PRAM) flash card (optional) integrated into the
FAP, can be selected and initiated, as the BoardinG Music (BGM). Instead
of the flash card, PRAM-audio cassette/compact disc reproducer can be
optionally installed. - the Video Control Unit (VCU) if a video system
is installed (optional). A PA announcement can be automatically
initiated from the PRAM when: - the NS (or optionally EXIT) or FSB
cockpit switches are set to AUTO and the landing gear is down and locked
or slats and flaps are activated, - a cabin decompression occurs.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
PA LEVEL The CIDS transmits the PA announcements and the BGM to all
passenger related loudspeakers. When an engine is running, the PA volume
is increased automatically by + 6 dB, and by + 4 dB in the event of
cabin depressurization, monitored by the Cabin Pressure Controller
(CPC). The PA volume is also increased in case of a data bus failure
(top line). If during a PA announcement the cockpit door is opened,
there is a volume decrease of the PA announcement in the cockpit door
area, to avoid a feedback with the cockpit. The CIDS gives the
possibility to change the volume of chimes and announcements in all
defined cabin areas independently. To change the settings in one area,
the LEVEL ADJUSTMENT page must be selected on the FAP. The related
Adjust button must be pushed on the LEVEL ADJUSTMENT page to open the
related VOLUME ADJUSTMENT subpanel. To select the respective location
the up/down buttons must be pushed on the VOLUME ADJUSTMENT subpanel.
The volume of announcements and chimes is increased/decreased by pushing
the related plus/minus button on the subpanel.

PASSENGER ADDRESS SYSTEM OPERATION (3) PASSENGER ANNOUNCEMENT FROM CABIN
The cabin can be split into a maximum of three cabin zones, depending on
the airline options. This information is stored in the Cabin Assignment
Module (CAM) flash card. The director uses it to identify the commands
received from the cabin attendant handsets and to transmit the passenger
announcements to the relevant cabin zone. An attendant handset is
mounted at each attendant station. An AIP is installed near each handset
for display of PA-use information. When the handset is lifted, a dialing
tone (440 Hz) is heard. The top line of the AIP shows a sharp "\#"
symbol. When you press the PA ALL key, a confirmation message is shown
on the AIP. If the PA call is impossible due to the priority of a call
already in progress, then the word "BUSY" appears on the AIP display. To
press the keypad RESET key always clears any handset operation and lets
you make a new key selection. The numbers of all selectable PA zones and
the respective keypad keys are stored in the CAM flash card. The CAM
flash card also contains a priority list which is established if an
announcement can be broadcasted. Once a PA call is established, the
respective "PA IN USE" message is shown on the bottom line of all AIPs.
Cockpit "PA IN USE" indicator, located on the calls panel is provided as
an option. The PTT switch keys the PA system. Side tone audio is fed to
the handset earpiece. When the PA announcement is over, you can
disconnect the handset from the PA system as follows: - put the handset
into the cradle or, - press the RESET button.

CABIN INTERPHONE SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The cabin and cockpit interphone
system is used for the telephone communications between the ATTeNDant
stations and, between the ATTND stations and the cockpit. A
communication is always initiated by a dial procedure with the attendant
handset or by pushbuttons on the CALLS panel in the cockpit.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS)
director (DIR) accepts audio signals from the various interphone sources
in the aircraft and assigns priorities to each source. The DIR does
telephone exchange switching and call functions from cockpit call switch
settings or the attendant handset keypad entries. All this is done with
reference to the parameters defined in the Cabin Assignment Module
(CAM). Chimes are transmitted via the top line data bus and the DEU A to
Passenger Address (PA) loudspeakers. In the cockpit, the amber light
(flashing) on the ATTendant transmission key on the audio control panel
annunciate interphone calls, accompanied by a buzzer sounds. In the
cabin, the area call panels and Attendant Indication Panels (AIPs) are
used for annunciation.
same communication mode, the source with the higher priority will have
preference. If they have the same priority, the interphone source which
was dialed first will be given preference.
CALL FROM THE CABIN Interphone communications are done with the
attendant station handsets which are connected to the type B
Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs). To initiate a call, take the handset off
the hook and then select the pushbutton on the keyboard. When the
communication link is established, all the visual indications in the
cabin are reset when the cabin handset is taken off its hook. All ATTND
stations in the cabin have a RESET key to reset the interphone function,
and proceeds to a new dialing.
CALL FROM THE COCKPIT Calls from the cockpit are initiated from the
CALLS panel which is connected to the DIRs. Connection of the cockpit to
the cabin interphone system is done using the CABin key and knob on the
audio control panels. The call pushbuttons on the CALLS panel let the
crew select the ATTND station. On the A321, the CALLS panel has two
additional pushbuttons: - the MIDdle pushbutton is used by the crew to
select the middle station, - the EXIT pushbutton is used by the crew to
select the exit station.
PRIORITY
ALL ATTENDANT CALL (CONFERENCE CALL)
All communication modes are handled with respect to the predefined
priorities listed below: - 1, emergency call, - 2, call from cockpit
including an all call from cockpit, and a normal call from cockpit, - 3,

reproducer. The PES music (or video) is a cabin distribution network,
which supplies the In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) and the Passenger
Service System (PSS) functions to the passenger seats. The IFE transmits
all installed audio programs and video sounds to the passengers. In
addition, the director transmits PA announcements to the IFE. On the
FAP, the PAX SYStem key let switch the power distribution of the IFE
system on/off. The IFE transmit the PA announcement to the headsets and
the passenger can hear the audio programs through the headset connected
to the jack on the Passenger Control Unit (PCU).
OPTIONs The No Smoking (NS) and Fasten Seat Belt (FSB) announcements can
be stored in the PRAM and can automatically be broadcast through the PA
system in the cabin when the NS and FSB switches are set to AUTO
position in the cockpit, and the landing gear and/or flaps/slats
conditions are met, through respectively the Landing Gear Control and
Interface Unit (LGCIU) and the Slat Flap Control Computer (SFCC).

PRERECORDED ANNOUNCEMENTS
PRERECORDED ANNOUNCEMENTS OPERATION
The prerecorded announcements can be stored in different media, as tape,
compact disc or flash card. The PRAM has the capability to produce an
emergency announcement in the event of a rapid cabin decompression
thanks to a ground signal from the rapid decompression sensor. All the
functions are remotely controlled from the AUDIO page on the FAP, except
the output level of normal and emergency announcements for audio
cassette/compact disc audio reproducer type. They are adjustable at the
front of the reproducer.
BOARDING MUSIC
The PRAM is controlled from the AUDIO page of the FAP, which gives
access to the prerecorded announcement messages: - Play All, key and
display to start all previously entered announcements, - Play Next, key
and display to start the announcement which has been entered in the
first input field, - Stop, key and display to terminate previously
started announcement. The activation of a prerecorded announcement sends
a "PA IN USE" message to the Attendant Indication Panel (AIPs).
There are two sources for the BGM: The PRAM audio reproducer or flash
card and the Passenger Entertainment System (PES) audio

CIDS EVACUATION SIGNALLING D/O (3) GENERAL
NOTE: The CMD key available on the AAP is installed as an option.
The EVACuation signaling system is used to send aural and visual signals
in the cabin and in the cockpit for evacuation, following a request from
the flight crew or attendants if an emergency condition should happen.
The system can be controlled either from the cockpit or from the cabin.
COCKPIT CONTROL In the cockpit, a control panel and a horn for aural
indications are installed. The EVAC control panel contains: A COMMAND
guarded P/BSW to start the signaling or for a complete reset with two
labels: - EVAC: Which flashes red when the system is activated, - ON:
Which comes on white when the P/BSW is pressed in. A HORN SHUT OFF P/B
to silence the horn in the cockpit. A two positions switch: - CAPT &
PURSer is used to trigger the system either from the cockpit or the
cabin, - CAPT: The system can only be triggered from the cockpit.
CABIN CONTROL In the cabin, the system can be controlled from the Flight
Attendant Panel (FAP), the Additional Attendant Panel (AAP) or the
switch panel. The system configuration is defined by each customer. The
following keys are used for this purpose: - EVAC RESET (on FAP), RESET
(on AAP and/or switch panel): Cancels the evacuation tone in the related
door area attendant loudspeakers, - EVAC ComManD (on FAP) or EVAC (on
AAP and/or switch panel): Signals the EVAC signaling activation (EVAC
alert signal), - EVAC CMD (on FAP) or CMD (on AAP): Is used to activate
the EVAC signaling and to show an EVAC COMMAND indication.
ACTIVATION FROM THE COCKPIT The system can be activated by using the
COMMAND guarded P/BSW on the EVAC panel 21VU installed on the overhead
panel. The following indications will happen: - the EVAC indicator light
in the COMMAND P/BSW flashes in red, - the ON indicator light in the
COMMAND P/BSW switch comes on white, - the EVAC horn gives an
intermittent signal. On the FAP, on the AAP, and on the switch panel: -
the EVAC RESET button and EVAC indicator light flash in red on the
respective FAP hard key panel, AAP, and switch panel. From the attendant
loudspeakers: - the EVAC tone is heard as an intermittent signal. On all
the Attendant Indication Panels (AIPs) the "EVACUATION ALERT" message is
shown associated with flashing red light. In this configuration, only
one of the following actions can be done at a time: - by using the EVAC
COMMAND P/BSW, all messages are cancelled in the cockpit and in the
cabin, - by using the EVAC HORN SHUT OFF, the EVAC horn is silenced, -
by using, the 'EVAC/RESET' button on the FAP hard key panel or the
"RESET" buttons on the AAP or on the switch panel causes that all visual
and acoustic indications in the related cabin zone are cancelled. The
EVAC/RESET button on FAP hard key panel and the EVAC indication on the
AAP and/or switch panel are illuminated until the initial station
cancels the EVAC command.

CIDS WARNINGS (3) list on the ECAM STATUS page. Class 1 faults are
recorded in the CFDS LAST/CURRENT LEG REPORT and the POST FLIGHT REPORT.
GENERAL The indication of the failures depends on their importance. On
the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP), there is a Cabin Intercommunication
Data System (CIDS) CAUTion light in the upper left corner of the
touchscreen. It is normally off. The CAUT light comes on amber and
flashes when the active director (DIR) detects a fault that needs cabin
crew action. The action needed is shown in the heading row (e.g. Please
select Doors page). When you select the page, the CAUT light stops
flashing and remains on continuously. If the fault is cleared the CAUT
light goes off. For some faults, the required page is automatically
shown on the FAP, there can also be a blue card message. This is a blue
rectangle with a fault message written in amber. Major CIDS faults
(class 1) are also indicated to the flight crew with Flight Warning
System (FWS) level 2 or level 1 alerts. All CIDS faults generate
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS)/MCDU class 1, 2, 3 messages.
Contrary to cockpit indications, the FAP failures indications do not
depend on flight phases.
NON CRITICAL CIDS FAULTS Non critical CIDS faults (e.g. Cabin Assignment
Module (CAM) layout transmission failure) have no flight crew related
effects, so there are no 'in flight' cockpit alerts. In most cases there
is no FAP CAUT and/or message. However some of these faults are class 2
maintenance faults only. The cabin crew is not alerted, but these class
2 faults are indicated to the cockpit crew in flight on the ECAM STATUS
page after manual selection and are the subject of an ECAM report (POST
FLIGHT REPORT...) on the ground after engines shutdown. The ECAM STATUS
page shows MAINTENANCE CIDS 1 (2).
NOTE: The STATUS page does not appear automatically after a warning.
MAJOR CIDS FAULTS (CLASS 1) Class 1 CIDS faults are: - CIDS DIR 1 and 2
fault, - a top line bus failure, - a middle line bus failure, - 25 % of
Decoder/Encoder Units (DEUs) type A failed, - 50 % of DEUs type B with
failed connected handsets. In each case the cockpit display will be:
MASTER CAUT light (amber), single stroke chime, and an ECAM message CIDS
1+ 2 FAULT on the EWD (inhibited in flight phases 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8).
CIDS 1+2 message will be added to the INOP SYStem

CIDS PROGRAMMING (3) GENERAL
SOFTWARE LOADING
The cabin programming is made from the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP). The
Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) is customizable. A system
reconfiguration for the installation of options, cabin reconfiguration
or CIDS expansion is limited to software database changes: the On Board
Replaceable Module (OBRM) and the Cabin Assignment Module (CAM). The
OBRM defines the operating software of the CIDS, and all connections to
the related systems and emergency functions. The CAM defines the cabin
layout. According to the program, the directors (DIRs) will consider the
various cabin features and options validated by the CAM software and
will make sure that the CIDS operates properly. This software is in the
CAM A part. The CAM also has another essential role: To define all
messages and page layouts of the FAP screen. It is known as CAM B.
During the CIDS power-up, the DIRs will compare CAM and OBRM layout with
their memories. If they find a difference, CAM data will be downloaded
automatically. OBRM data can be downloaded manually by the FAP SOFTWARE
LOADING page only. In the case of a total FAP failure combined with loss
of the CAM and the OBRM flash cards, the CIDS will operate in restricted
operating mode (basic functions active), thanks to the simplified
operating software and cabin layout memory stored in the DIRs. The CIDS
programming can operate on: - SOFTWARE LOADING, - CABIN PROGRAMMING, -
LAYOUT SELECTION, - LEVEL ADJUSTMENT.
To load the CIDS software, the SOFTWARE LOADING page on the FAP should
be used (SW Load button). This page is protected by an access code and
is only available on ground. Plug in new data storage hardware (OBRM
flash card) to load the new software version. The FAP "SOFTWARE LOADING"
page will show the CIDS hardware and software details as follows: - DIRs
and FAP Part Numbers (PN), Serial Numbers (SN) and Functional Item
Number (FIN), - active OBRM PN and software PN, - in slot OBRM PN and
software PN. NOTE: Note: When the 'active' and 'in slot' data is
different, it is highlighted in amber. If there is no difference, it is
highlighted in green.
NOTE: Note: The FAP pages are protected from unauthorized use by a
password except for the FAP SET-UP page.

CIDS PROGRAMMING (3) CABIN PROGRAMMING The CIDS makes the cabin zone
boundaries and the no smoking zone boundaries changes. This programming
function is possible on ground and in flight. To relocate these zone
boundaries, select the Cabin Prog button and the area Smoke Prog buttons
on the FAP CABIN PROGRAMMING page. Zone boundaries are situated between
two seat rows. Each cabin zone has to contain a minimum of one seat row.
The NON SMOKER A/C ON/OFF button is used to set the entire cabin as a no
smoking area. Thus the Smoke Prog buttons are disabled. To save the
changes, push the Save button. The change is saved in the CAM as a
modified layout. Without saving the new entries, the previous settings
stay valid. NOTE: The option "Non Smoker aircraft at first power up" is
standardized. The aircraft acts as a "Non-Smoker Aircraft" from the
first flight on without any manual reprogramming. In this case all NS
signs will be on at every power up. The non-smoker aircraft at power up
will be set in the CAM as a default setting.

MAIN MULTIPLEXER The MAIN MUltipleXer generates a Radio Frequency (RF)
signal which contains the audio information from the audio
reproducer(s), and video System Control Unit (SCU), Passenger Address
(PA) announcements from the Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS)
and video signals from the video SCU. If PA announcements are to be
made, the CIDS sends a keyline signal to the audio reproducer and to the
Video Tape Reproducers (VTRs) , through video SCU, to stop them. A
coaxial cable transmits the RF signal to the Seat Electronic Boxes
(SEBs), according to the zone selection through the Wall Disconnect
Boxes (WDBs). The SEBs only transmit the selected audio signal to the
headsets through the Passenger Control Unit (PCU). A zone selection, for
PA announcements and video sounds, for a maximum of 2 zones, is made
through keylines. Passenger Services System (PSS) digital data is
exchanged between the MAIN MUX and the PCU. The MAIN MUX transmits this
data through an ARINC 429 data bus to the CIDS directors (DIRs).
WDB Each WDB supplies a maximum of 2 SEB columns.
AUDIO REPRODUCER The audio reproducers provide different music programs
from cassettes tape or compact disks, to the MAIN MUX. The audio
reproducers also send one music program, among 4 music programs, for
BoardinG Music (BGM), to the CIDS DIRs. The BGM program selection is
done through 3 keylines from the CIDS DIR. BGM program selection and
volume are controlled from the Flight Attendant Panel (FAP).
BITE The BITE is used for detection and isolation of system and
component faults. All BITE data of the Passenger Entertainment System
(PES) music is assembled in the MAIN MUX. It transmits the BITE data
through an ARINC 429 data bus via the CIDS directors to the Centralized
Fault Display System (CFDS). The BITE data transmission to the CFDS is
made continuously in normal mode and on request in interactive mode. In
interactive mode, the BITE is connected to the MCDU through the CFDS.
The MAIN MUX starts an automatic self-test after power-up and a manual
self-test after transmission of the related MCDU commands.
SEB The SEB changes the combined RF audio signal back to its original
analog form and only transmits the selected program to the PCU. Each SEB
supplies a maximum of 3 PCUs. The SEBs receive PCU selected data and
transmit it to the CIDS DIR, through the WDB and the MAIN MUX.
PCU The PCU allows the passengers to select the channel, to adjust the
volume and to hear music and video sounds. Each PCU has a stereophonic

VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM D/O (PANASONIC) (OPTION) (3) VCC
VTR
The video System Control Unit (SCU) with the Video Tape Reproducers
(VTRs) compose the Video Control Center (VCC). The video SCU controls
the Passenger Entertainment System (PES) video. The video SCU receives
video and audio signals from the VTRs. It generates a Radio Frequency
(RF) signal which contains the video signals and sends it through the
Tapping Units (TUs) to the related Display Units (DUs). The video SCU
operates in the following formats: - PAL, - SECAM, - NTSC. The video SCU
sends the video sounds to the Main Multiplexer (MAIN MUX) and to the
Cabin Intercommunication Data System (CIDS) directors (DIRs). The
passengers can hear the video sounds through headsets connected to the
Passenger Control Units (PCUs) or from the loudspeakers. Each Passenger
Address (PA) announcement overrides the PES video sounds in the related
zones and stops the VTRs. In case of a rapid cabin decompression, the
video SCU stops the video transmission and controls the retraction of
the DUs installed in the hatrack. The interface between the optional
Cabin and Passenger Management System (CPMS) and the video SCU allows
the following functions: - remote control of the video system, camera
control unit and Passenger Visual Information System (PVIS), - display
of news and advertisements provided by the CPMS, - preview of video
programs. The PVIS is an option that receives information which is
processed, formatted and transmitted as video signals to the video SCU.
It transmits this information to the DUs. Optional video cameras convert
optical images into video signals compatible with the video system. This
signal is sent to the video SCU and can be shown on the DUs. The cameras
can be remotely controlled from the CPMS.
The VTR supplies audio and video signals to the video SCU. The VTRs are
remotely controlled from the video SCU. On the front panel of the VTRs,
all the operation controls are installed. The following video systems
are possible: - VHS, - SVHS, - BETA, - VIDEO 8, - high band video 8. The
following signal formats are possible: - PAL, - SECAM, - NTSC.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
TAPPING UNIT The TUs distribute the video signals to the DUs in each
cabin zone. Each TU can supply a maximum of 2 displays. Each TU has a
pin-coded address to give a unique address to the unit. This enables the
video SCU to control each DU individually.
BITE The BITE is assembled into the video system. All the PES video BITE
data is transmitted through an ARINC 429 data bus to the MAIN MUX. The
MAIN MUX sends this data through an ARINC 429 data bus via the CIDS DIRs
to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). The video SCU starts an
automatic self-test after power-up and a manual self-test after
transmission of the MCDU command. In CFDS interactive mode, the BITE is

PAX VISUAL INFORMATION SYS D/O (OPTION) (3) DIU The PVIS comprises the
Digital Interface Unit (DIU) and the remote control unit. The DIU is the
main computer of the PVIS. It is connected to the aircraft avionics
systems and to the Passenger Entertainment System (PES) video. The DIU
interfaces with: - the Air Data/Inertial Reference System (ADIRS), - the
Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS), - the PES video, - the
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). The DIU processes all the
information and selects the appropriate maps and points of interest
stored in its memory. The DIU is also connected to other systems: - the
Air Traffic and Information Management System (ATIMS), - the cabin
management system. The DIU is supplied with 28V DC and powered via the
Video Control Center (VCC) master switch. The remote control unit is the
input device for the PVIS. The remote control unit front plate has four
P/BSWs and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) character control screen.
NOTE: The DIU brings digital data stored in its internal memory
(CD-ROM).
CFDS The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) is connected
to the DIU through a unidirectional ARINC 429 low speed data bus for
maintenance purposes.
ATIMS The Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU) is connected to the DIU
through an ARINC 429 low speed data bus. The ATSU allows connecting
gate, arrival information, messages and other data to be up-linked from
ground stations.
CABIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The cabin management system is connected to the
DIU through an ARINC 429 low speed data bus. The cabin management system
controls and monitors the PVIS by means of the lap top computer.
OPERATION
ADIRS The Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) 2 is connected to the
DIU through two unidirectional ARINC 429 data buses: - an ARINC 429 low
speed data bus transmits the actual air data, - an ARINC 429 high speed
data bus transmits the inertial reference data.
FMGs The Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC) 2 is connected
to the DIU through an unidirectional ARINC 429 data bus, in order to
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
send data to the DIU. Certain parameters requiring an input
(destination, flight time,...) can be entered either by the cabin staff
or loaded from FMGC.
The DIU reads data from the FMGCs and the ADIRUs through ARINC 429 data
buses. These data are used for DIU memory access from where information
is processed, formatted and transmitted as a video signal to the PES
video. The video System Control Unit (SCU) transmits this information to
the DUs to be shown.
BITE A test is done automatically at power-up or manually from the
control unit. The result of this test is transmitted to the video SCU.

ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (2) Electrostatic discharge PROBLEMS Electro
Static Discharge (ESD) is generated by rubbing materials with each
other. By moving over plastic materials (synthetic fibers), wearing
synthetic fiber clothing, electrical charges build up on the body. Thus
voltages of 12000 to 35000 volts can develop on a person. Touching
connector pins of computer units, a discharge path is formed through
wiring and components. Integrated Circuit (IC) chips can be partly
damaged or totally destroyed. Rubbing materials from the
"tribo-electris" series against each other and then separating them from
each other causes a build-up of electrostatic charges. If the materials
are far apart in the series, there will be a higher electric charge.

OPERATION (continued) RMP FREQUENCY SELECTION The Radio Management
Panels (RMP) are the Digital tuning head for the Communications
transceivers. They are installed on the center pedestal, with an
optional one installed on the overhead for the 3rd observer seat. The
panels have an over center ON/OFF switch. When the ON/OFF switch is
switched to the ON position, two frequencies that were previously
selected appear in the ACTIVE and STandBY windows. To operate the
transceiver, you might have to select a new frequency on one of the VHF
or HF transceivers. To do this, you must select the transceiver that you
wish to transmit on. To select the radio, the related radio pushbutton
must be pushed on the RMP. The related green LED will come on. The
desired frequency can be selected in the STand-BY/CouRSe window using
the dual selector knob. Pressing the transfer pushbutton activates the
frequency and displays it in the active window, whereas the previous
active frequency transfers to the stand by window.
the related reception knob must be released out. The reception knob
comes on white. To adjust the reception volume level, the selected
reception knob must be turned. Communication can now be established.
VHF 1 OPERATION When a Push-to-Talk (PTT) switch is depressed on one of
the hand mikes, the related hand mike is connected and the transceiver
transmits. The boomset mike is connected to a transceiver when the
INT/RAD switch is held in the RAD position on the ACP or the PTT is
pressed on the side stick. On the ACP, several reception knobs can be
selected simultaneously. If the reception knob is pressed in again, the
receiver is disconnected and the white light goes off.
TRANSMISSION MODE To connect one of the acoustic devices (microphone) to
the transmission line, the related transmission key must be selected on
the Audio Control Panel (ACP). When the transmission key is pressed
(green light on) you are ready to transmit. This selection can be
disabled when you select another transceiver or when you press the
lighted pushbutton again. Only one transmit key can be selected at a
time.
RECEPTION MODE In order to listen on the selected transceiver, you must
operate the Audio Control Panel (ACP). On the ACP, the reception knobs
are used to connect the acoustic equipment (headset) to the transceiver
reception via the Audio Management Unit. To select a transceiver,

FLIGHT INTERPHONE SYSTEM OPERATION Flight interphone selection is
necessary for voice communications between flight crewmembers and for
ground handling, taxiing and towing. This control is done using the ACP.
If the flight crew needs to maintain contact and communicate with the
mechanic, the flight crew can push the MECHanic pushbutton on the CALLS
panel on the overhead panel. The Flight Interphone can also act as a
transceiver. Selection of the INTerphone transmission key lights the
green bars, indicating that the flight interphone is ready to operate.
Pressing and releasing the INT reception knob turns on the knob light
and adjusts the interphone audio level. The INT position enables
permanent use of the flight interphone without any further operator
action and independent of transmission key selection. The INT/RAD switch
is a 3-position switch with INT being a stable position. The RAD
selection connects the pre-selected channel to transmit. The RAD
position is a momentary contact, and is spring loaded to the center
position. This position acts like the selection of the PTT on the hand
microphone or the side-stick.

COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS When jacking
the aircraft it might be necessary to communicate between personnel at
various points around the aircraft. With weight off wheels, the service
interphone system is disabled due to the logic of the system. The on
ground discrete from the Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU)
disables all service interphone connections. The reason for this is to
stop potential static noise started and amplified through the AMU due to
the length of wires acting as antennae, into the audio system. To
re-enable the service interphone, the SerViCE INTerphone OVeRriDe P/BSW
must be switched to 'ON'. The Service Interphone Override switch is on

NEW GENERATION AUDIO SYSTEM (3) DIGITAL RADIO AND AUDIO INTERGRATING
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DRAIMS) A new digital audio cockpit system will bring
significant improvements to pilots and aircraft operations compared to
current analogue audio. The Digital Radio and Audio Integrating
Management System (DRAIMS) received EASA certification in March 2020 for
the A320 Family. The digital audio system will become the baseline for
the A320 Family of aircraft over the next few years (and A330/A350) Here
we look at the changes to the aircraft systems architecture linked to
the installation of digital audio, what benefits it brings and the
different operating modes from a flight crew perspective.

UNDERSTANDING THE NEW DIGITAL AUDIO SYSTEM Although the audio system
peripherals (radios, boomsets, headsets, interfaced computers such as
FWS, TCAS & GPWS etc) have evolved and improved significantly over the
years, the core elements of the audio system on A320 (and A330 Family
aircraft) have remained essentially unchanged since the initial type
certification of those aircraft types. In the legacy architecture, the
heart of the system, the Audio Management Unit (AMU), is connected to
all peripheral equipment using multiple analogue links. Additional
standalone computers such as the Cockpit Amplified Loudspeaker, the
Audio Mixing box and the SELCAL box, perform functions not included in
the AMU.
IMPROVING AND STREAMLINING THE ARCHITECTURE The AMU has a completely new
design. It now includes some of the previously external computers (such
as the SELCAL box) and has a dual channel configuration with internal
reconfiguration capability to improve robustness. Wherever it is
technically feasible, links are now digital between the AMU and the
peripheral equipment. Now, the RMPs (and not the AMU) manage the
boomsets, headsets, hand microphones, oxygen mask microphones and
loudspeakers. The power supply has been updated with dual power supply
for RMP and AMU to ensure higher levels of equipment and function
availability in the case of degraded electrical configurations.
The Human Machine Interface (HMI) is principally based on two separate
control panels, the Radio Management Panel (RMP) and the Audio Control
Panel (ACP). There is some limited synchronisation between RMPs, and in
case of system failure requiring reconfiguration, the flight crew need
to intervene manually (AUDIO SWITCHING control). The digital audio
system is designed to: • improve and streamline the architecture,
simplifying installation and increasing robustness • update the HMI to
bring it into line with solutions available on the A350 and A380 •
increase synchronisation and simplify operating procedures to reduce
crew workload • integrate additional functions and provide provisions
for future upgrades and aircraft dispatch capability /remove airline
tasks

OPERATION The RMP builds on the service-proven design from the proven
A380 and A350 platforms, but takes into account the desire to implement
new functions, as well as the physical installation constraints of the
A320 center pedestal Different cockpit layouts are available according
to operators' needs: 2 RMP + 1 ACP, 3 RMP or 3 RMP + ACP. The RMP has a
single part number and can be programmed such that the HMI is coherent
with the installed equipment. For example, if the aircraft is not
equipped with an HF radio, then the associated menu key and
transmissions keys will not be illuminated and pressing on those keys
will have no effect. Some functions are controlled via a Line Select Key
(LSK) and the RMP software can be programmed to give access, or not, as
required (for example, CPDLC LOAD function), or to accurately reflect
the aircraft configuration (for example, STBY NAV function and NAVAIDS
listening). Different A320 cockpit layouts are available according to
operators' needs: 2 RMP + 1 ACP, 3 RMP or 3 RMP + ACP. The RMP has a
single part number and can be programmed such that the HMI is coherent
with the installed equipment.
Increasing synchronisation and simplifying operating procedures Some of
the main changes are explained below, with further details provided in
the section "digital audio operating modes from a flight crew
perspective": • The RMP allows the pilot to see at a glance the active
and standby frequencies selected for all the installed radios of each
type (up to 3 VHF radios, 2 HF radios and single or dual channel SATCOM
installations). The SEL indicator has been deleted. • All information is
now fully synchronized between all RMPs in the cockpit. This includes
active and standby frequencies of all installed radios, and STBY NAV
tuning. • Shortcut keys have been implemented for the squawk codes and
the principal operating modes of the TCAS.
For example, if the aircraft is not equipped with an HF radio, then the
associated menu key and transmissions keys will not be illuminated and
pressing on those keys will have no effect.

Some functions are controlled via a Line Select Key (LSK) and the RMP
software can be programmed to give access, or not, as required (for
example, CPDLC LOAD function), or to accurately reflect the aircraft
configuration (for example, STBY NAV function and NAVAIDS listening).

• Alerts from the FWS, TCAS and GPWS are broadcast through the boomsets
and headsets, in addition to the loudspeakers. • Failure case management
has been simplified and the appropriate procedures are available in the
FWS; for example, in case of RMP failure, the single action of switching
off the associated RMP automatically activates the reconfiguration onto
the remaining available HMI (RMP or ACP).

INTERGRATING ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS Line Select Keys (LSK) which have
different functions according to the page being used:
• The RMP now incorporates the controls for the TCAS and transponder,
which allows for the dedicated control panel for those systems to be
removed. • For compatible SATCOM solutions (currently under
development), the RMP now allows control of the dialing, directory
functions and system settings, as opposed to them being hosted in the
MCDU for legacy SATCOM solutions. • The RMP has spare keys and adequate
processing power to be able to add new functions as and when they become
available.
