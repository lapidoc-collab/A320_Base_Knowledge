\- the A319 is 3.74 m (12ft 3in) shorter, **AIRCRAFT GENERAL**
\- the A321 is 6.93 m (22ft 9in) longer.
The A320 NEO is the most advanced family aircraft in service today, with
fly-by-wire flight controls.
The A318, A319, A320 and A321 are twin-engine subsonic medium range
aircraft.
The family offers a choice of engines:
\- International Aero Engines and CFM International for the A319, A320
and A321.
\- Pratt & Whitney and CFM International for the A318.
The NEO SA family (except the A318) offers a choice of engines:
\- Pratt & Whitney PW 1100G engines,
\- CFM LEAP-1A engines.
**SHARKLET PURPOSE**
The sharklets are specially designed for a better eco-efficiency and
payload-range performance of the A320 family:
\- Less fuel burn,
\- Less CO2,
\- Revenue payload increased,
\- Higher range with the original payload,
\- Higher available takeoff weight,
\- Lower average takeoff thrust (with large savings in engine
maintenance costs),
\- Lower takeoff noise,
\- Better climb performance,
\- Higher initial cruise altitude.
**AIRCRAFT DIMENSIONS**
The picture shows the main dimensions for the A320.
The A318, A319 and A321 have exactly the same dimensions except that:
\- the A318 is 6.12 m (20 ft) shorter, EFFECTIVITY: A319/A320/A321

**COCKPIT PHILOSOPHY**
Prior to the design of the A320 family aircraft, the designers examined
previous generation aircraft cockpit system indications. A decision was
made on the system indicator lights on the overhead panel that indicator
lights do not come on when systems are in normal operation and there are
no failures.
This ergonomic design enabled the pilots to immediately see when a
system is faulty or has been manually shut off.
Most of the pushbuttons with light have two stable positions: pressed in
and released out, each position is related to a control signal sent to a
system.
Pressed in (recessed):
\- normally used system activation (AUTO or ON),
\- temporarily used system activation (ON),
\- system activated for maintenance operation (ON) or override (OVRD).
Released out (flush with the panel):
\- deactivation of a system (OFF),
\- manual activation of a system (ON),
\- activation of an alternate system (ALTN).
Some pushbuttons have only one stable position:
\- released out.
When pushed, they send a control signal to the system.

The Functional Item Number (FIN) is unique, for a given equipment it
corresponds to one function and one location.
For electrical equipment (any component with an electrical connection)
the FIN could be for example 1CA1 which is broken down as follows:
\- 1: First component in circuit CA,
\- CA: System/circuit, two letter code (Autothrust Engagement),
\- 1: Suffix, first of several similar systems (Autothrust Engagement
1).

**UN-SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE in AMM Section 05-50-00**
This Chapter 05-50-00 includes the maintenance checks that you must do
when a flight crew report shows abnormal flight conditions.
Such maintenance actions are divided into two categories of information:
\- inspections,

MAINTENANCE CHECKS (1) **SCHEDULED REPETITIVE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH**
**MPD**
The main objective of the MPD document is to provide maintenance
planning information necessary for each operator to develop a customized
maintenance program.
MPD reflects all repetitive scheduled maintenance tasks declared by
AD/CN, AOT, ISB, SIL, and MOD/SB and analyzed under the MRB.
A typical scheduled repetitive task (Integrated Drive Generator (IDG)
scavenge filter) is listed with the following data:
\- the threshold interval, source document, cross-references to other
manuals or documents (Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) and SIL),
\- Man Hours required to accomplish the work,
\- the applicability in this Envelope document.
Note the Zonal inspection, requested by C CHECK interval, on the tension
of the fan cowl latches, the AOT, AMM and SIL cross-referenced.
Some maintenance tasks have a higher ranking of requirement, when the
maintenance requirement is identified as:
\- \"Airworthiness Limitations Item\" (ALI) or \"Life limit parts\",
\- \"Certification Maintenance Requirements\" (CMR).
The approved document MRB REPORT Appendix 1 lists all these
airworthiness approved issues, the ALIs and CMRs.
The MPD details these airworthiness related items in the \"Time
controlled Items\" and \"Life Limits\" sections.
It is the responsibility of each operator to adjust his own maintenance
program in accordance with his National Authority.
