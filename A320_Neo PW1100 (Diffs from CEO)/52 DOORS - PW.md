**PASSENGER DOORS**
The single aisle family is equipped with two forward and two aft
passenger doors.
The normal door operation is fully manual.
They are plug type doors, which open upward, outward and forward
parallel to the fuselage.
The door can be operated from inside or outside the aircraft.
Each door is equipped with an emergency opening system:
\- an escape slide or slide raft stowed in a container attached to the
inboard lower side of the door,
\- a door damping and emergency operation cylinder that assist normal
door operation, but in an emergency acts as an actuator for automatic
door opening,
\- a slide ARMING/DISARMING lever.
When the slide arming lever is in the ARMED position, the slide is
connected to the floor.
When the door is opened, the escape slide inflates automatically.
Opening the door from the outside will disarm the door and the escape
slide.
The ECAM page indicates the door in the locking/unlocking position and
the escape slide/slide raft in the armed/disarmed condition (position).
CAUTION - Training Point
There have been several reported incidents of doors being opening with
excessive cabin pressure present. this results in the door pushing
outwards at speed and with force, causing injury.
Introduction of new labels on the door area give additional
recommendations to minimize the possibility of cabin residual pressure
during ground air supply This improves awareness to reduce risk of
aircraft damage and/or injury to persons during operation of the ground
air supply.

**AIRBUS CABIN FLEX (ACF)**
The Airbus Cabin Flex (ACF) programme introduces a reconfiguration of
the cabin and passenger doors to allow additional seating.
\- A319/A320: Space Flex rear galley and toilets
\- A321: Space Flex rear galley, toilets and passenger door
reconfiguration.
Note: The current legacy 4-door configuration for passenger doors is
still available.
The number 2 door has been deleted. The number 3 door has been moved aft
by 4 frames. Double overwing exits have been installed. They are
referred to as Overwing Doors (OWD).
Note: Depending on the cabin configuration/capacity, one of the OWDs (on
both sides) may be deactivated (normally the aft doors).
This increases the seating from 220 to a maximum 244 seats - although
IAW TCDS (Type Certificate Data Sheet) No.: EASA.A.064, this is a
virtual LOPA (Layout of Passenger Accommodations) and a separate
approval is needed for seat configurations above 220.
The rear galley configuration 'Space Flex' can also be retrofitted to
the existing CEO fleet.

**EMERGENCY EXIT DOORS -- OVER WING**
**GENERAL**
The overwing emergency-exit door structure is made of aluminium-alloy
machined parts and of a sheet metal skin. The doors are attached at the
top edge with piano hinges to the aircraft structure.
By removing the cover panel, the target attached to the cover panel
moves away from the proximity switch. This arms the slide mechanism and
the white 'SLIDE ARMED' light comes on.
When the operator pulls the internal handle, the door is unlocked and
opens.
Two spring actuators control the opening speed and hold the emergency
exit in the open position. When the door opens, the overwing escape
slide will automatically be activated.
Proximity sensors send door status to the ECAM system.
The door is fitted with an electrical Flight Lock Actuator (FLA) that
prevents door opening when 1 of the engines is operating.
Similar to the CEO overwing hatches, a double lane escape slide
automatically inflates when the door is armed and then opened. The slide
is stowed in an unpressurised stowage compartment in the wing/body
fairing. The slide bottle is stowed in the forward part of the rear
freight (Ref AMM 25-62- 00). A manual operation handle is provided in
the door cut-out in case the auto system does not operate.
Specifications of the overwing emergency-exit doors are:
\- Size: 1235 mm (48.62 in.) x 554 mm (21.81 in.) x 102 mm (4.02 in.
\- Weight (without lining): 25.5 kg (56.22 lb) EFFECTIVITY:

**EMERGENCY EXITS DOORS -- DOOR 3**
**GENERAL**
The A321 ACF has two emergency exit doors at the Door 3 position.
They are type C doors. They have a plug-type design and are made of
aluminium alloy. One emergency exit door is installed on each side of
the cabin between frames FR48 and FR50. They open outboard and move
forward, parallel to the fuselage when their locking mechanism is
operated from the inner or outer side of the aircraft.
Note: These doors are similar to the 60 inch CEO doors at 2R, 3L & 3R
Specifications of the emergency exit doors are:
\- Size: 1524 mm (60.00 in.) x 762 mm (30.00 in.)
\- Weight (without lining): 68 kg (149.91 lb)
\- They are type C doors
The door damper / emergency cylinder can be safetied for maintenance.
It also incorporates a physical gauge to check the pressure of the
accumulator.
Slide and Inflation Cylinder (not illustrated Ref AMM 25-62-00) Each
door has a slide and inflation cylinder.
The slide is located in an unpressurised stowage compartment below the
door. The inflation cylinder is located above each door inside the
cabin.

**AIRBUS CABIN FLEX (ACF)**
**DESCRIPTION/OPERATION - OWD**
When the cover panel is removed, the target attached to the cover panel
moves away from the proximity switch. This arms the slide mechanism and
the white 'SLIDE ARMED' light comes on.
When the operator pulls the internal handle, a vent flap assembly
operates and prevents the pressurization of the cabin when the overwing
emergency-exit door is not closed, latched and locked. An over centre
mechanism keeps the vent flap assembly closed if there is a different
outer pressure. An outside opening handle is positioned in the vent
flap.
As the handle is pulled further, the latches disengage from the latch
hooks. At the same time, two actuators (spring assemblies) with lift
arms, connected to the fittings open the overwing emergency-exit door
from the closed to the fully open position (0-109 degrees).
The spring actuators control the opening speed and hold the emergency
exit in the open position.
The inboard handle controls the vent flap assembly and operates as the
outer handle if the operator opens the overwing emergency-exit door from
the outer side. The inboard handle unlocks the vent flap assembly
through the over enter mechanism and a small hatch in the vent flap
assembly.
There are 4 proximity sensors that monitor and control the indications.
A mechanical indicator gives the lock status of the door.
The door is fitted with an electrical Flight Lock Actuator (FLA) that
prevents door opening when 1 of the engines is operating.

**FLIGHT LOCK ACTUATOR (FLA)**
To prevent inadvertent opening of the overwing exit doors, each door is
fitted with an electrical Flight Lock Actuator (FLA).
The FLA is signalled closed by an engine running signal from the EIU
(Engine Interface Unit). Either engine running will cause all four FLAs
to lock.
Note: FIN Numbers 30WN1 (2, 3, 4)
The flight lock actuator also gives all the necessary outputs to the
other aircraft systems for indication of the engaged or disengaged
position.
The FLA can be deactivated under MMEL 52-10-09C.
Test/reset switches are located on top of the 82VU rack.

**EMERGENCY EXIT OWD - DISARMING**
Normally, when the internal handle cover panel is removed, the slide is
armed (indicated by the white indicator lighting coming on).
When performing maintenance, the slide/door must be disarmed.
To disarm the slide/door, the maintenance engineer must slide the disarm
shaft and turn it clockwise until the slide release lever is behind the
disarm bracket of the overwing emergency-exit-door structure. The slide
system is now disarmed. This disengages the shaft from the lever to the
inboard handle control. The spring of the slide release mechanism holds
the shaft behind the disarm bracket.
Note: The disarm assembly is on the upper LHS or RHS depending on which
door/side is being disarmed.
