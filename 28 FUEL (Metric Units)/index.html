FUEL SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW The A318, A319 and
A320 have the same fuel system design. The fuel tanks are in the center
fuselage area and the wings. The center tank is a part of the center
wing box. The wing tanks are divided into inner cells and outer cells.
To have less structural load on the wings, the fuel in the outer cells
is not used until the fuel load in the inner cells decreases to a low
level. Two fuel pumps are installed in the center tank and two other
fuel pumps are installed in each wing tank inner cell. Fuel is supplied
to the engines from the center tank first. When the center tank is
empty, fuel is supplied from the wing inner cells. There is no direct
feed from the outer cells to the engines. Two inter cell transfer valves
are used to transfer fuel from the outer cells to the inner cells when
the fuel quantity gets to the low level. Two engine Low Pressure (LP)
valves are installed to stop the fuel supply to the engines. The LP
valve is closed when its related engine stops or when the FIRE
pushbutton is released. A cross feed valve is used to connect or isolate
the left and right sides. With this valve, fuel can be supplied to one
engine or the other from all available fuel pumps. On the ground, the
cross feed valve is used to transfer fuel from tank to tank. The fuel
system also supplies fuel to the APU directly from the left side. The
APU LP valve is installed to stop the fuel supply to the APU. It closes
when the APU stops or when the APU FIRE pushbutton is released.

FUEL SYSTEM COMPONENT LOCATION (2) SYSTEM OVERVIEW (continued) A321 (+
Later A320) The A321 fuel tanks are in the center fuselage area and the
wings. Like the A318/A319/A320, the center tank is part of the center
wing box but with the difference that the wing tanks are not divided.
The tanks are simply known as left and right wing tanks. Two fuel pumps
are installed in each wing tank. Fuel is supplied to the engines from
the wing tanks only. While the fuel level in the wing decreases, the
center tank fuel is transferred to the wing tanks until the center tank
is empty. Transfer valves control the fuel transfer from the center tank
to the wing tanks. The transfer valves supply pressure for two jet
pumps. These pumps are installed in the center tank and they transfer
the fuel from the center tank to the wing tanks. Two engine Low Pressure
(LP) valves are installed to stop the fuel supply to the engines. The LP
valve is closed when its related engine stops or when the FIRE
pushbutton is released. A cross feed valve is used to connect or isolate
the left and right sides. With this valve, fuel can be supplied to one
engine or the other from all available fuel pumps. On the ground, the
cross feed valve is used to transfer fuel from tank to tank. The fuel
system also supplies fuel to the APU directly from the left side. The
APU LP valve is installed to stop the fuel supply to the APU. It closes
when the APU stops or when the APU FIRE pushbutton is released.

VENTING SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) GENERAL
OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION
The fuel tank venting system prevents overstressing of tanks.
Overpressure protectors are installed in the system to relieve pressure
in the tanks that might occur through vent blockage or a pressure
refueling gallery failure. An excess pressure in the outer cell relieves
fuel into the inner cell via an overpressure protector mounted on rib
15. An excess pressure in the inner cell or in the vent surge tank
relieves fuel overboard via an overpressure protector installed on a
tank access panel. The center tank overpressure protector relieves fuel
into the left inner cell.
VENT SURGE TANK Each vent surge tank vents to the atmosphere through a
NACA type intake connected with a vent duct. Inside the vent duct there
is a vent protector and a flame arrestor. The function of the vent
protector is to prevent clogging of the vent duct by ice formation. The
flame arrestor reduces the risk of a ground fire igniting the fuel
tanks. Fuel spilled through the vent pipes into the surge tank is
induced back into the outer cell by a scavenge jet pump using motive
power from the wing fuel pumps. Be careful when you do work near the
left-wing surge tank, there is a possible risk of asphyxiation if you
put your head through the opening of the NACA duct access panel.
WING TANK VENTING SYSTEM
VENT FLOAT VALVES Two vent float valves prevent fuel from passing in the
vent lines during A/C bank maneuvers. The open ends of the ducts and the
vent float valves, which permit air to vent but not fuel, are positioned
at the optimum levels for refueling and normal ground/flight maneuvers.
A vent float valve fitted to the outer side of sealed rib 15 permits air
to be vented from the outer cell to the inner cell during flight
maneuvers.
Each wing tank inner and outer cell vents to the related vent surge
tank. The vent lines are fitted with a vent float valve. The ducts are
large enough to make sure that if the pressure refueling shut-off fails,
excess fuel will be discharged overboard through the NACA intake. A
rubber check valve installed in the vent line allows any fuel that finds
its way into the vent lines to drain back into the related tank, where
it is installed.
CENTER TANK VENTING SYSTEM The center tank vents into the LH vent surge
tank. The center tank vent line is a conventional open line, provided
with a check valve and large enough for airflow. In case of overfueling
of the center tank most of the fuel flows over to the right wing tank
through the relief valve. Be careful when you do work near the center
tank, there is a possible risk of asphyxiation if you put your head
through the opening of the tank access panels.

VENTING SYSTEM DESCRIPTION/OPERATION (3) VAPOR SEAL The vapor seal is a
fabric membrane that isolates the Center tank from the air conditioning
compartment below. Pressurized air from around the mixer unit AFT of the
FWD cargo flows through the space between the vapor seal and the tank
bottom to ventilate it.
DRAIN MAST A system of drains at the rear of the vapor seal conveys
drainage and ventilating (exhaust) air through a drain mast to
atmosphere. The drain mast is an aluminum fairing bolted to the
underside of the fuselage. Such drain mast also receives the possible
fuel leakage from the shrouded APU fuel supply line
LEAK MONITOR In the event of fuel flowing from the drain mast, check the
leak monitor to determine the area of leakage: center tank or APU fuel
supply line.

ENGINE FEED SYSTEM D/O (3) - a smaller outlet is connected to the
scavenge jet pumps and the fuel pump pressure switch.
GENERAL The main fuel pump system supplies fuel from the fuel tanks to
the engines. Each tank has two centrifugal booster pumps.
CROSSFEED VALVE The crossfeed valve divides the engine fuel feed system
into two independent systems. The valve is located in the center tank
and is usually in the closed position. In this position, it divides the
main fuel pump system into two parts, one part for each engine. When the
crossfeed valve is open, either tank can supply fuel to either engine.
The valve is electrically controlled and operated by two DC motors.
MAIN FUEL PUMPS The main pumps are driven by a 3-phase 115V AC motor.
The two pumps in each tank are supplied by different electrical power
supply bus bars. When it is in operation, each main pump may supply fuel
to: - its related engine, - the fuel recirculation cooling system, - the
crossfeed system, - the refuel/defuel system.
FUEL PUMP CANISTER The canister lets you replace the fuel pump without
draining fuel. The fuel pump element is located in a canister attached
to the bottom skin of the wing or the centre wing box, with an inlet
connected to a fuel strainer. The canister has different outlets: - one
upper outlet is connected to the engine feed line and contains an
internal flap-type check valve, - the other upper outlet is connected to
a sequence valve (for wing tank pumps only),

pump. The center fuel pump element is located in a canister attached to
the center tank bottom skin, with a lower inlet connected to a fuel
strainer.
AIR RELEASE VALVE The air release valve releases air, trapped in the
engine fuel feed line, into the wing tank. The air release valve is
installed at the highest point between the pump and the LP fuel valve.

ENGINE FEED SYSTEM D/O (3) SCAVENGE JET PUMP OPERATION The scavenge jet
pump has: a jet pump body a jet adaptor assembly The jet pump body fully
contains the jet adaptor assembly. The jet pump body has a flange at one
end for the installation to the tank structure. The jet pump body has
also three threaded openings: Z is the outlet form the jet pump Y is the
inlet from the fuel tank X is the inlet from the related fuel pump The
jet adaptor assembly has: a non-return valve (NRV) a jet nozzle The NRV
has a spring and a valve assembly. If the related pump is set to off,
the spring closes the NRV. Thus fuel cannot enter the fuel pump that is
set to off.
OPERATION When the related fuel pump is on, fuel goes into the jet pump
through the inlet X. The fuel flows through the NRV and the jet nozzle.
The jet nozzle decreases the pressure and increases the velocity of the
fuel that goes through. This causes a suction force at the inlet Y that
is connected to a pipe system and therefore connected to the lowest part
of the tank. The fuel at the inlet Y is moved through the jet pump,
mixed with the fuel from the inlet X and distributed through the outlet
Z.

ENGINE FEED SYSTEM D/O (3) WING TANK PUMP OPERATION AND SEQUENCE VALVES
When all the tanks contain fuel, the center tank is emptied first. The
wing tank pumps have a sequence valve to make sure that the center tank
is emptied first. The sequence valve acts as a relief valve and keeps
the output pressure of a wing tank pump 5 psi lower than that of the
center tank pump. The pumps in each wing tank are located in the lowest
area of the inner cell in a collector cell. Seven clack valves at the
bottom of rib 2 allow the fuel to flow into the collector cell but
prevent the fuel from flowing back during wing down manoeuvres of the
aircraft. Thereby the fuel pumps are sufficiently immersed in fuel even
if the fuel level in the tank is low. Each wing tank collector cell
has: - two fuel pumps contained in their related canisters, - two fuel
strainers, - a suction valve, - two check valves.

PRINCIPLE The temperature of the Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil is
decreased by fuel through a recirculation system. Some of the fuel that
supplies the engines is used to decrease the temperature of the IDG oil.
A Fuel Return Valve (FRV) lets the hot fuel return to the outer cell.
The FRV opens at low engine fuel flow if the engine oil temperature is
more than 90°C (199°F). The return valve mixes the hot fuel with cold
fuel from the Low Pressure (LP) fuel pump to keep the temperature of the
returned fuel less than 100°C (212°F). The Fuel Level Sensing Control
Unit (FLSCU) 1 and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) 1 control the
recirculation system in the left wing. FLSCU 2 and ECU 2 control the
right wing system.

FUEL IDG COOLING SYSTEM PRESENTATION (3) FRV CLOSURE OVERFLOW The Fuel
Return Valve (FRV) closes if the center tank pump does not obey the
logic signals of the full level sensors. This causes the wing tank to
overflow through the tank ventilation system into the vent surge tank.
The overflow sensor sends an electrical signal to the FLSCU. The FLSCU
sends a closure signal to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) through the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The ECU closes the FRV and stops the fuel
supply back to the outer cell.

FUEL IDG COOLING SYSTEM PRESENTATION (3) FRV CLOSURE (continued) OUTER
CELL HIGH TEMPERATURE The FRV closes if the fuel temperature is too high
in the outer cell, i.e. 52.5°C (126.5°F). Because the returned fuel from
the engine is hot, the FLSCU prevents an overtemperature in the wing
tanks. The FLSCU sends a closure signal to the Electronic Control Unit
(ECU) through the Engine Interface Unit (EIU). The ECU closes the FRV
and stops the fuel supply back to the outer cell.

CELL HIGH TEMPERATURE The FRV closes if the fuel temperature is too high
in the inner cell, i.e. 55°C (131°F). Thus a large volume of
high-temperature fuel will not go into the inner cell if the intercell
valve opens. This also keeps the fuel temperature at an acceptable level
if a tank rupture occurs.

APU FEED SYSTEM D/O (3) two DC motors in the actuator are supplied from
different 28V DC sources.
GENERAL
VALVE OPEN
The APU fuel supply system comprises a fuel pump, a Low Pressure (LP)
fuel valve and an actuator on the rear wall of the center tank. The fuel
supply to the APU is normally from the Left Hand (LH) crossfeed line.
The APU LP fuel shut-off system has a LP fuel valve that controls the
supply of fuel to the APU. If an APU fire occurs on ground, the APU
emergency shutdown system closes the LP fuel valve to stop the flow of
fuel. When the crossfeed valve is open, either engine feed line, left or
right, can supply fuel to the APU.
The valve opens when: - the APU MASTER SWitch is set to ON, - the FUEL
VENTilation P/BSW in the APU compartment is pressed and held. The FUEL
VENT P/BSW is used to purge the system during ground maintenance.
VALVE CLOSE
APU PUMP
The valve closes when: - the ECB powers down after APU shutdown, - the
FUEL VENT P/BSW is released, - the APU FIRE P/BSW on the overhead panel
released out , - the APU FIRE SHUT-OFF switch on the panel FWD of the
Nose Landing Gear (NLG) bay is operated, - the fire detection system
operates on the ground (APU Emergency Shutdown and APU Auto
extinguishing function).
The fuel pressure for the APU comes either from the APU fuel pump or the
engine fuel pumps. For normal operation, the essential bus bar 801XP
(115V AC) supplies the pump motor. When the bus bar is not energized,
the static inverter bus bar 901XP (115V AC) supplies the pump motor.
CANISTERS The canister permits pump replacement even with fuel in the
tanks or in the APU fuel line. When a pump is removed, the fuel pressure
closes the canister inlet and outlet.
PRESSURE SWITCH The pressure switch controls pump operation. The
pressure in the left crossfeed line operates a micro switch. The APU
fuel pump stops if the crossfeed line pressure reaches 23.3 psi absolute
(1.6 bar) and restarts at 21.7 psi (1.5 bar).
APU LP SHUT-OFF VALVE
FUEL VENT P/B When the A/C is on ground, it is possible to operate the
APU fuel pump (single phase 115VAC) to purge the fuel line. The FUEL
VENT P/BSW on frame (FR) 80 in the APU compartment is used to operate
the pump and to open the LP fuel valve.
APU MASTER SWITCH If the APU MASTER SW P/BSW is pressed ON, the APU pump
will operate if the pump inlet pressure is below 21.7 psi (1.5 bar)
absolute. This is initiated automatically through the pressure switch.
The APU LP fuel shut-off valve is used to isolate the APU fuel supply
line from the left engine feed line, when the APU does not operate. The

HIGH LEVEL LIGHTS A blue HIgh LeVeL light for each tank comes on when
the associated high level sensor is covered. The related refuel valve
will close.
PRESELECTED
REFUEL VALVE SELECTOR
When automatic refueling, the fuel quantity taken aboard is governed by
the setting on the PRESELECTED display.
There is one refuel valve selector per tank. For an automatic refueling,
these refuel valves selectors remain in the NORMal position. For the
defueling, the valves will not open. When the selector is set to OPEN,
the refuel valve operation depends on the MODE SELECTor position. With
the MODE SELECT in the REFUEL position, each refuel valve closes when
the associated high level is reached. When the REFUEL VALVES selector is
set to the SHUT position, the refuel valve is closed. This is
independent of the MODE SELECT position.
ACTUAL
MODE SELECTOR
The ACTUAL total quantity indication shows the amount of fuel on board.
ROCKER SWITCH The desired fuel figure of the pre-selector is obtained by
tripping the rocker switch to decrease or increase.
END LIGHT
With the MODE SELECT at OFF, the refuel valves are closed. When the MODE
SELECT is set to REFUEL, the refuel valves operate automatically or
manually depending on the position of the refuel valve selectors. For
defueling or transfer of fuel the MODE SELECT is set to DEFUEL/XFR. It
opens the defuel/transfer valve.
The green END light comes on when automatic refueling is complete. It
flashes in case of incorrect fuel pre-selection or when automatic refuel
operation has stopped for any reason other than completion of normal
operation.
OPEN LIGHT The amber OPEN light comes on when the MODE SELECT is set to
DEFUEL/XFR. It confirms the opening of the defuel/transfer valve.

refuel/defuel control panel.
OPTIONAL FUEL QUANTITY PRESELECTOR IN FLIGHT COMPARTMENT Optionally, the
refueling operation can also be controlled from the cockpit via the
cockpit refuel/defuel control panel. From this preselector, the aircrew
can set the required quantity of fuel and initiate automatic refueling
operation. This cancels any fuel quantity set on the belly fairing
refuel/defuel control panel. When the required fuel quantity is set on

RH wing adjacent to the refuel coupling, comes on. When the PoWeR P/BSW
is pushed, the ON light comes on, and the refueling circuits are
energized. The white CocKPiT light also comes on, on the preselector
panel in the cockpit and on the external refuel/defuel control panel.
When the high level sensors fail, refueling is stopped and the FAULT
light on the PWR P/BSW comes on. The refuel valves switches on the belly
fairing refuel/defuel control panel are in the NORM position and the PWR
P/BSW pushed. When the ConTroL momentary action P/BSW is pushed, the ON

REFUEL/DEFUEL SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL
when energized and a refuel pressure is supplied, opens the valve. The
refuel gallery is a fuel line that connects all the refuel valves
together.
The refuel/defuel system controls the fuel flow into or out of the A/C.
Automatic refueling, manual refuel, defuel or ground transfer are
controlled from the refuel/defuel control panel, installed on the belly
fairing. A refuel/defuel coupling, also installed in the leading edge of
the wing, is the interface between the refuel/defuel system and the
external fuel source. Wing tank gravity refueling is possible. To fill
the fuel tanks to their maximum capacity, the A/C must be level. During
an automatic refueling, the refueling of each fuel tank is controlled by
the FQI computer. The main fuel pumps are used to defuel the A/C. The
defuel/transfer valve and the crossfeed valve must be open.
SPILL PIPES
DIFFUSERS The diffusers, installed on refuel lines, diffuse fuel into
the tanks with minimum turbulence and electrostatic build-up.
AIR INLET AND DRAIN VALVES
REFUEL/DEFUEL CONTROL PANEL The primary components on the refuel/defuel
control panel are: - the control panel, - the fuel quantity
PreSELector, - the fuel quantity indicator. When the quick release door
of the refuel/defuel control panel is opened, it operates a micro
switch, which sends a signal to the FQI computer and connects the 28V DC
supply to the refuel/defuel electrical circuits.
REFUEL/DEFUEL COUPLING
The air inlet valve lets air into the refuel gallery after refueling.
Thus fuel can drain from the refuel gallery through the fuel drain
valve. A pipe extends from the air inlet valve to the outboard side of
rib 21. This pipe makes sure that the air inlet remains above the fuel
level at all times. This stops the movement of fuel from one wing tank
to another by gravity. The fuel drain valves are closed by fuel pressure
in the refuel gallery. When the pressure source is removed, the valve
opens to allow fuel to drain from the refuel gallery into the wing tank.
DEFUEL/TRANSFER VALVE
The refuel/defuel coupling supplies the wing tanks and the center tank.
When not in use, the coupling is fitted with a pressure-blanking cap.
The refuel/defuel coupling has a standard 2.5 inch adaptor flange. The
coupling ring has a breakaway groove around its circumference. This
prevents damage to the A/C structure if a sideways force is applied.
The defuel/transfer valve connects the main fuel pump system to the
refuel gallery. When open, the valve permits the fuel in the main fuel
pump system to be moved into the refuel gallery. The valve is controlled
by the MODE SELECT toggle switch on the refuel/defuel control panel.
PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE
REFUEL VALVE AND REFUEL GALLERY Each refuel valve, one per tank, is the
interface between the refuel gallery and the related fuel tank. The
valve is controlled by a solenoid which,
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
During a refuel operation, the outer cell is filled first. When it is
full, fuel flows into the inner cell through the spill pipe which
connects the two cells together.
The pressure relief valve releases fuel into the RH wing tank if a
center tank overflow occurs.

HIGH LEVEL SENSOR One high level sensor is installed in each tank. When
the high level sensor is immersed in fuel, the Fuel Level Sensing
Control Unit (FLSCU) receives this state, amplifies this signal to
control the refuel valve to close.
OVERWING REFUELING POINTS (OPTIONAL) As an option, each wing tank has an
overwing refuel point installed in the upper wing surface, to refuel the
A/C when a pressure refuel source is not available. During an overwing
refuel, the fuel only goes into the wing tank. It is then necessary to
do a fuel transfer to get the fuel into the correct fuel-load
configuration.

FUEL QUANTITY INDICATING (3) GENERAL The Fuel Quantity Indicating (FQI)
is a computerized capacitance type system. The system mainly gives: -
fuel mass/temperature measurement and display, - control of automatic
aircraft refueling, - system integrity monitoring using BITE, - ARINC
429 digital data for interface to other systems.
FQIC The Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC) does the fuel mass
calculations and controls the whole system by using various interfaces.
The FQIC has two identical channels. Each channel calculates the tank
quantities and monitors the status of the other channel. The healthiest
channel is in control. If one channel fails, the system operates
normally, but the ECAM will indicate a failure warning on the upper
Display Unit (DU) as well as the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS)
report will indicate the failure.
PROBES A set of capacitance probes in each tank sends a signal to the
computer in relation to the fuel level in the tank. There are 5 probes
in the center tank and 14 per wing tank. 2 probes are inside the
optional Additional Center Tank. A single probe failure does not affect
the system indication. In each tank inner cell, fuel probe No. 2 and in
each outer cell fuel probe No. 13 have diodes that give the fuel
temperature to the FQIC for indication on the ECAM system display.
CAPACITANCE INDEX COMPENSATOR One probe with a Capacitance Index
Compensator (CIC) is installed inside each tank such that under normal
operational conditions it is always
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
fully submerged in fuel and thus the permittivity of the fuel can be
determined. The Capacitance Index Compensator has a capacitance in
proportion to the dielectric constant of the fuel. The capacitance value
is a result of the density of the fuel between the plates. The fuel
density changes with temperature and type of fuel. In the case of
cadensicons failure, the fuel mass can be calculated from a density
value as assumed from the dielectric constant value. This standard
dielectric constant value depends on the type of fuel and fuel
temperature.
CADENSICONS The cadensicons give a signal to the computer in proportion
to the density and the dielectric constant of the fuel held in each
tank. The fuel mass is calculated from this density value.
FLSCU The Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCU) are mainly used: - to
shut the related refuel valve when the high level is reached in each
tank, - to start the BITE test of the high level sensors and their
related circuits, by using the TEST switch on the refuel/defuel control
panel. High-level sensors in each tank send a signal to the FQIC, via
the FLSCU. The test is started via the FQIC and the FLSCU. Sensor and
system status is sent from the FQIC to the CFDS.
REFUEL/DEFUEL CONTROL PANEL The FQIC sends automatic shut-off indication
at a preselected refuel quantity. When the MODE SELECT switch on the
refuel/defuel control panel has been set to the REFUEL position, the
FQIC first makes sure that it is physically possible to transfer the
preselected fuel quantity from tank to tank.Throughout the automatic
refuel operation the FQIC monitors the density of fuel in each tank and
the distribution of the load.

MTI
FMGC
A Multi Tank Indicator (MTI) displays the fuel quantity in each tank.
Fuel parameters are sent to the Flight Management and Guidance Computers
(FMGCs), for navigation computations.
FWC
ECAM
The FWC sends the audible warning and the MASTER CAUT light comes on.
Total and individual tank fuel mass information is sent to the ECAM for
display.
PRESELECTOR The pre-selector shows the pre-selected and actual total
fuel quantities, as monitored by the computer.
LGCIU 1 The FQIC receives the left and right L/G compressed information
from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1.
L/G CONTROL LEVER The FQIC receives ground information from the L/G when
selected DOWN with the aircraft on jacks. This signal is used to supply
electrical power to the FQIC in this specific configuration.
ADIRS Acceleration data is received from the Air Data/Inertial Reference
System (ADIRS) during flight and is used as an alternate source of
attitude. Normally, effects of attitude, changes in acceleration,
effective pitch and roll angles, are calculated from the height of fuel
at each probe and the knowledge of the tank geometry stored in the
computer memory.
CFDS ARINC 429 output links transmit BITE information from the computer
to the CFDS. The CFDS monitors fault conditions and BITE.

FUEL QUANTITY INDICATING (3) OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLE In each tank the
density of the fuel is measured by using a cadensicon, which measures
only its respective tank. The signals have a continuous 30 seconds time
average applied to remove fluctuations. If the cadensicon signal is not
available or invalid (all failed or out of range in water) the
Capacitance Index Capacitor (CIC) signal is used. One probe has a CIC at
its lower end. The CIC has a specific function: - to measure the
dielectric constant, because most of the time it is fully covered by
remaining fuel in tank. The FQIC uses the dielectric constant to
calculate the fuel volume in the tanks. The electrical capacitance of
each probe is proportional to the height of fuel around the probe. One
CIC probe is positioned in the tank (always fully submerged in fuel
under normal operational conditions) measuring the permittivity of the
fuel (K, also called the dielectric). A separate component called
Cadensicon (on A318, A319 &amp; A320) or, Ultracomp and Dualcomp (on the
A321) is used to measure the density of the fuel. With fuel height and
permittivity data, the volume of fuel in the tank (cell) is determined.
When combined with the fuel density information the mass of fuel is
calculated by the FQIC.
NOTE: The ECAM displays the Fuel on Board (FOB) with two amber dashes as
a degraded display, as long as the accuracy is not degraded beyond 5%.
NOTE: Non-constant temperature basically changes the Density and
Permittivity. In normal operation the FQIC calculates the mass of fuel
with an accuracy of 1%. In back-up operation, if density information is
lost, once the volume of fuel in the tank (cell) is determined, the fuel
density is assumed from the Dielectric characteristic (K) as per the
chart. The "Block FUEL" is calculated by the FQIC, but with a reduced
accuracy (less than 3% to 4%).

FUEL LEVEL SENSING (3) - generating the wing tank low level warning on
ECAM when exposed to air for more than 30s.
B2 SCOPE
FULL LEVEL
CAUTION: MODULE TAGGED B2 SCOPE. BE AWARE THAT ONLY AVIONICS/ELECTRICAL
TOPICS SHOULD BE LEARNED FOR A T2 COURSE.
A center tank pump will stop when the two FULL LVL sensors in the
related wing tank are wet. The pump will not operate again until at
least one UNDERFULL LVL sensor in the related wing tank is dry. The
related center tank LOW LVL sensor must also be wet for the pump to
restart.
GENERAL The aircraft is equipped with two multi-channel Fuel Level
Sensing Control Units (FLSCU) and a third one, if the Additional Center
Tank (ACT) is installed. They provide high fuel level sensing, low fuel
level sensing, full fuel level sensing, underfull fuel level sensing,
overflow level and temperature sensing. Fuel level and temperature
sensors feed signals to the multi-channel amplifiers. The FLSCU detect
and amplify the signals and trigger switching functions in the
appropriate circuits.
HIGH LEVEL The FLSCUs use signal conditioning to independently monitor
the high level sensors. When the high level sensor in the fuel tank
becomes wet, the FLSCUs will give a output to: -close the related refuel
valve -cause the related HI LVL light to come on at the refuel panel
LOW LEVEL A signal is given to the time delay relays when a center tank
LOW LVL sensor becomes dry. When the LOW LVL sensor has been dry for
five minutes, the related center tank pump is latched off. 3 low level
sensors at a fuel level of 750 Kg (1653 lbs) in each wing tank are used
for: - opening of the Intercell Transfer Valves simultaneously in both
wing tanks when exposed to air the first time.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
UNDERFULL LEVEL The full and underfull level sensors are installed in
the wing tanks. The FLSCU use the full and the underfull level sensor
data to control the automatic operation of the center tank fuel pumps.
This controls the wing tank fuel level. Data from the full level sensor
is used to make sure the fuel level (in the wing tank) does not increase
above the full mark. Data from the underfull level sensor is used to
make sure that the fuel level (in the wing tank) does not decrease to
less than 500 kg (1100 lb) below the full mark (with fuel in the center
tank).
OVERFLOW LEVEL If the center tank pump fails to stop with inner cell
full level reached, the overflow sensor sends a signal, via the FLSCU,
to the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) to close the Fuel Return Valve (FRV).
TEMPERATURE SENSOR The fuel temperature sensor in the wing tank inner
cell sends a high fuel signal temperature signal 52.5°C (126.5°F). The
fuel temperature sensor in the wing tank outer cell sends a high fuel
signal temperature signal 55°C (131.0°F).

IDG SHUT-OFF SENSOR When the IDG shut-off sensor is dry (280 Kg) the
FLSCU signals the fuel return valve to close. This stops the fuel
recirculation system, to prevent an increase in the amount of unusable
fuel in the wing-tank. The IDG shut-off sensors stop the IDG cooling
when the fuel quantity is less than 280 Kg (616lbs).

FUEL FEED SYSTEM OPERATION (2) AUTO MODE (continued) TRANSFER SEQUENCE
Each center tank transfer valve is controlled independently by its
adjacent wing tank level sensors, i.e. full and underfull. When the fuel
level in one wing has decreased by 200 kg, and has therefore reached the
underfull level, the center tank transfer valve is controlled to open,
and is displayed green, in line on the ECAM. Fuel is transferred from
the center tank to the wing tank. When the full level is reached, the
transfer valve is controlled to close, and is displayed green, cross
line on the ECAM. NOTE: This sequence can be initiated on ground
depending upon the fuel level. The transfer sequence is terminated; the
center tank transfer valves close when the center tank low level sensors
are dry and 5 minutes time delay has elapsed. There are four low level
sensors per wing tank: - two for 1500 kg level, - two for 750 kg level.
When the fuel level in the wing tanks has decreased and two 1500 kg
level sensors in a wing are continuously dry for 30 seconds, a MEMO
message is shown. When the fuel level still decreases and two 750 kg
low-level sensors in a wing are continuously dry for 30 seconds a low
fuel level warning is triggered, i.e. single chime, MASTER CAUTion. When
the engines are stopped, the engine identification numbers become amber.

FUEL QUANTITY INDICATING (3) GENERAL
ULTRACOMP
The Fuel Quantity Indicating (FQI) is a computerized capacitance type
system. The system mainly provides: - fuel mass/temperature measurement
and display, - control of automatic aircraft refueling, - system
integrity monitoring using BITE, - ARINC 429 digital data for interface
to other systems.
The ultracomp has three functions: - variable capacitors value, which
has the same function as the dualcomp, - a velocimeter measurement
function, - a temperature sensing function. The FQIC uses all this
information together with the dual comp to calculate the density of the
fuel.
FQIC The Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC) does the fuel mass
calculations and controls the whole system by means of various
interfaces. The FQIC has two identical channels. Each channel calculates
the tank quantities and monitors the status of the other channel. The
healthiest channel is in control. If one channel fails, the system
operates normally, but the ECAM will indicate a failure warning on the
upper Display Unit (DU) as well as the Centralized Fault Display System
(CFDS) report will indicate the failure.
PROBES
FLSCU The Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCUs) are mainly used: -
to shut the related refuel valve when the high level is reached in each
tank, - to initiate the BITE test of the high level sensors and their
related circuits, by using the test switch on the refuel/defuel control
panel. High level sensors in each tank send a signal to the FQIC, via
the FLSCU. The test is initiated via the FQIC and the FLSCU. Sensor and
system status are sent from the FQIC to the CFDS.
REFUEL/DEFUEL CONTROL PANEL
A set of capacitance probes in each tank sends a signal to the computer
in relation to the fuel level in the tank. A single probe failure
doesn't affect the system indication. In each wing tank, a diode is
attached to fuel probe No. 2 that gives the fuel temperature to the FQIC
for indication on the ECAM system display.
The FQIC provides automatic shut-off at a preselected refuel quantity.
When the MODE SELECT switch on the refuel/defuel control panel has been
set to the REFUEL position, the FQIC first makes sure that it is
physically possible to take the preselected fuel quantity into the
aircraft. Throughout the automatic refuel operation the FQIC monitors
the density of fuel in each tank and the distribution of the load.
DUALCOMP
MTI
The dualcomp is installed in the fuel tank and operates as a variable
capacitor. The capacitance value is a result of the density of the fuel
between the plates. The fuel density changes with temperature and type
of fuel.
A Multi Tank Indicator (MTI) displays the fuel quantity in each tank.

FWC
ECAM
The FWC operates the audible warning and causes the MASTER CAUT light to
come on.
Total and individual tank fuel mass information is sent to the ECAM for
display.
PRESELECTOR The pre-selector shows the pre-selected and actual total
fuel quantities, as monitored by the computer.
LGCIU 1 The FQIC receives the left and right L/G compressed information
from Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1.
L/G CONTROL LEVER The FQIC receives ground information from the L/G when
selected DOWN with the aircraft on jacks. This signal is used to give
electrical supply to the FQIC in this specific configuration.
ADIRS Acceleration data is received from the Air Data/Inertial Reference
System (ADIRS) during flight and is used as an alternate source of
attitude. Normally, effects of attitude, changes in acceleration,
effective pitch and roll angles, are calculated from the height of fuel
at each probe and the knowledge of the tank geometry stored in the
computer memory.
CFDS ARINC 429 output links transmit BITE information from the computer
to the CFDS. The CFDS monitors fault conditions and BITE.
FMGC Fuel parameters are sent to the Flight Management and Guidance
Computers (FMGCs), for navigation computations.

GENERAL
FULL LEVEL
The aircraft has two multi-channel Fuel Level Sensing Control Units
(FLSCUs) and a third one, if the Additional Center Tank (ACT) is
installed. They supply high fuel level sensing, low fuel level sensing,
full fuel level sensing, underfull fuel level sensing, and overflow
level and temperature sensing. Fuel level and temperature sensors feed
signals to the multi-channel amplifiers. The FLSCUs detect and amplify
the signals and trigger switching functions in the appropriate circuits.
When the full level is reached in one wing tank, the center transfer
valve closes to stop fuel transfer operation from the center tank to the
wing tank until the fuel level in the wing tank reaches the underfull
level.
B2 SCOPE
HIGH LEVEL The high level sensors, when immersed in fuel, command the
closure of the associated tank refuel valve when the MODE SELECT switch
is set to the REFUEL position. Wet high-level sensors cause the
associated: - tank refuel valves to shut, - blue HIGH LEVEL lights to
come on, on the refuel/defuel control panel. The wet center tank
high-level sensor causes fuel transfer from the optional ACT to the
center tank to stop.
LOW LEVEL The center tank low-level sensors control the automatic
transfer of fuel from the center tank to the wing tanks. When sensors
become dry for 5 minutes, the FLSCUs send a close signal to the related
control valve. 4 low-level sensors are used in each wing tank:
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
UNDERFULL LEVEL When the fuel level in the wing tanks drop to the
underfull sensors, the center tank transfer valves are controlled to
open for a fuel transfer operation, provided there is fuel in the center
tank. The difference between full and underfull level sensors is equal
to a fuel quantity of 200 kg (440 lbs).
OVERFLOW LEVEL When full level is reached in the wing tank and overflows
into the vent surge tank, the overflow sensor sends a signal to the
Engine Interface Unit (EIU) to close the Fuel Return Valve (FRV).
TEMPERATURE SENSOR The temperature sensor commands the closure of the
FRV, when the temperature of the fuel in the wing exceeds the limits
i.e. 52.5°C (126.5°F).

FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY
IDG SHUT-OFF SENSOR The FLSCUs signal the Full Authority Digital Engine
Control (FADEC) to close the FRV. If the fuel level is below 280 kg (616
lbs), the IDG shut-off sensor stops the IDG cooling.

A321 FUEL VENT SYSTEM D/O (3) installed between rib 25 and rib 24. Too
much pressure in the inner cell or in the vent surge tank causes fuel to
be released overboard through an overpressure protector installed on a
tank access panel. The center tank overpressure protector releases fuel
into the left wing tank.
GENERAL The fuel tank venting system prevents overstressing of tanks.
VENT SURGE TANK Each vent surge tank vents to the atmosphere through a
NACA type intake connected to a vent duct. A vent protector and a flame
arrestor are in the vent duct. The function of the vent protector is to
prevent clogging of the vent duct by ice formation. The flame arrestor
decreases the risk of a ground fire which could cause ignition of the
fuel tanks. Fuel spilled through the vent pipes into the surge tank is
put back into the outer cell by a scavenge jet pump that uses motive
power from the wing fuel pumps.
VENT FLOAT VALVE This valve will let the air flow between the wing tank
and the related surge tank to keep an equal pressure. The float valve
will close when the wing tank is full to prevent fuel spills into the
surge tank.
WING TANK VENTING SYSTEM Each wing tank vents to the related vent surge
tank. The ducts are sufficiently large to make sure that if there is a
failure of the pressure refueling shut-off system, excess fuel will be
discharged overboard through the NACA intake. A rubber check valve
installed in the vent line lets all fuel that goes into the vent lines
drain back to the related tank.
CENTER TANK VENTING SYSTEM The center tank vents into the LH vent surge
tank. The center tank vent line is a standard open line that includes a
check valve and is sufficiently large for an airflow. If the center tank
is filled with too much fuel, most of the fuel flows to the right wing
tank through the relief valve.
OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION Overpressure protectors are installed in the
system to release pressure in the tanks that can be caused by a vent
blockage or a pressure refueling gallery failure. Too much pressure in
the outer cell causes fuel to be released into the inner cell through an
overpressure protector

ACT SYSTEM D/O (3) The check valves prevent the vapor from the ACTs in
the cabin. The filter cleans the air that goes into the tank.
GENERAL The Additional Center Tanks (ACTs) are extensions of the center
tank and are installed in the aft and FWD cargo compartments. ACTs to
center tank transfer is automatically controlled in flight. Cabin air
pressure pressurizes the ACTs for the transfer.
TRANSFER Automatic transfer is the normal mode in flight. If there is
system failure or flight at low level or on ground, manual transfer mode
is selectable. The automatic transfer occurs when: - the A/C is in
flight, - the slats are retracted, - the MODE SELector P/BSW is in the
AUTO position, - one ACT low level sensor minimum is wet, - the center
tank fuel level drops to 5000 Kg (11030 lb). When the fuel level reaches
5750 kg (12700 lb), the transfer stops, until it drops again to 5000 kg
(11030 lb). These conditions open the fuel inlet valve and the fuel
transfer valve on the fuel transfer line. For manual transfer, the MODE
SEL P/BSW must be pushed and the rotary selector set to the ACT that is
to be transferred. This condition opens the fuel inlet valve, the fuel
transfer valve and only if the aircraft is on ground, the ACT transfer
pump is energized. In flight, the cabin pressure will be used to
transfer the fuel.
PRESSURIZATION SYSTEM When the automatic fuel MODE SEL transfer is
selected, the ACT air shutoff valve opens and lets the air pressure from
the cargo compartment pressurize the ACTs. Fuel is then transferred from
the ACT to the center tank by pressurization. The pressure-reducing
valve regulates the ACTs air pressure to around 0.34 bar (5 psi) more
than ambient air pressure.

ACT REFUEL/DEFUEL SYSTEM PRESENTATION (2) GENERAL Different procedures
are used to refuel/defuel A/C. For refueling: - pressure refuel:
automatic and manual, - overwing refuel: gravity. For defueling: -
pressure defuel: main pumps operation. In automatic operation, the
Additional Center Tank (ACT) will only be refueled if the pre-selected
fuel quantity is greater than the maximum capacity of both the center
tank and the wing tanks.
ACT REFUEL VALVE A solenoid controlled refuel valve controls the fuel
flow into the ACTs. If the refuel valve does not operate correctly, the
valve can be open using its manual override-button.
ACT FUEL INLET VALVE Installed in the ACT fuel supply line, the ACT fuel
inlet valve opens when fuel has to be moved from the ACT to the center
tank or vice-versa.
REFUEL RESTRICTOR VALVE Installed in the fuel line inside the ACTs, the
restrictor valve limits the refuel rate but not the defuel rate of the
ACTs.
ACT FUEL TRANSFER VALVE Installed in the fuel line to the center tank,
the ACT fuel transfer valve opens in case of automatic or manual fuel
transfer.
ACT TRANSFER PUMP The ACT transfer pump operates when a manual fuel
transfer is selected.

FUEL TANK SAFETY PROCEDURES (2) General After three fuel tank explosions
in recent decades, which caused 346 deaths, the U.S Department of
Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), started a new
regulation to get better fuel tank safety. This regulation is related to
the prevention of ignition sources in fuel tanks of current type
certificated aircraft. It requires a one-time fuel system safety and
design review of the aircraft.
Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) The FAA issued
Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 88 which gives a detailed
description of the CDCCL concept. The DGAC requested the SFAR 88 to be
added to PART 145, PART M and PART 147 to reinforce the application of
these regulations. This includes: - a conception part related to
aircraft design characteristics, - a maintenance part. A CDCCL is a
limitation requirement to keep a critical ignition source prevention
characteristic of the fuel system design that is necessary to prevent
the occurrence of a dangerous condition. The function of the CDCCL is to
give instructions to keep the critical ignition source prevention
characteristic during a configuration change that can be caused by
alterations, repairs or maintenance actions. The aircraft manufacturers
must supply a document to their customers that gives the list of all the
maintenance tasks related to the CDCCL. For AIRBUS, this document is
called the Fuel Airworthiness Limitations and it is added to the
Airworthiness Limitation Section part 5.

FUEL TANK SAFETY PROCEDURES (2) General (continued) Fuel Information and
Combustion Triangle A fuel tank can be viewed as a confined space where
under specific conditions of pressure and temperature the ullage (vacant
tank space) can be made of an evaporated fuel/air mixture known as fuel
vapor. The liquid fuel does not blow up on its own; explosive conditions
are created when specific proportions of evaporated fuel, oxygen,
pressure and temperature are present in the tank ullage; the fuel vapor
is then defined as flammable. Even if the ullage is flammable, an
explosion will not occur unless an ignition source of sufficient energy
exists. The combustion triangle: An Explosion in a "Fuel" environment
such as aircraft wing tanks can only occur if the 3 following sources
are reached: - fuel vapors, - air (Oxygen O2), - ignition (Electrical
short cut, cigarette, etc.). The aircraft fuel system has, by design, a
number of features that are intended to protect the system from
inadvertent ignition. The potential sources of ignition considered
are: - spark generation inside a fuel tank by electrical current
originated from external sources such as a lightning strike on the
aircraft, by wiring or equipment electrical faults, - spark/heat
generation inside a fuel tank caused by friction of moving parts, - fuel
leakage outside of a fuel tank coming into contact with an ignition
source. A chart shows the fuel grades used. The flash point is the
lowest temperature at which the liquid supplies enough vapors mixed with
ambient air, to make a gas that will ignite with the contact of a
thermal source, also called flame. At this temperature the combustion
will not be self sufficient, because you need to reach the ignition
point.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
CATTS LTD
If the ignition does not need a flame, we talk about auto-ignition. The
Auto-Ignition point is the temperature at which a gas or a vapor ignites
spontaneously in the absence of a thermal source. Do not confuse this
term with the ignition point (temperature at which the combustion is
started and can continue).

FUEL TANK SAFETY PROCEDURES (2) Fuel System Design Configuration The
Airbus aircraft fuel systems have, by design, a number of features that
are intended to protect the system from inadvertent ignition. - Wing /
Trim Tank Structure: In all the fuel tanks, the material and the large
number of fasteners on the attachment of the metallic structure used
make sure that the fuel tank structures are electrically bonded.
Composite ribs are bonded by means of metallic strips attached to the
non-metallic structure. All aluminum structural items in the wing, trim
and centre boxes have a finishing for protection against electrical
harnesses short-circuit with the structure. The combination of the
construction and thickness of the tank boundary skins give protection
against a lightning strike causing ignition (heat). - Fuel Quantity
Indicating (FQI) Equipment: Probes and sensors installed in tanks have
low power supply. Electrical connection is done through a terminal
block. The protective gap between the probes and the tank structure is
maintained. They are electrically isolated from the structure. - Fuel
pump: Fuel pumps have safety features to prevent pumps from working in
an empty fuel tank. The pumps are tested to show that even after a long
working condition in an "empty fuel tank" the rotating surfaces remain
lubricated and thus limit the risk of mechanical ignition. Each of the
pumps is contained within an explosion-proof canister. It comprises a
pump element contained within and electrically bonded to the canister
and driven by an electric motor. Electrical connections to all pumps are
made outside the tank. The moving parts inside the pump are normally
submerged in fuel so they cannot generate a spark during faulty
conditions. - Lightning Protection: All equipment installed within any
fuel tank is bonded to the structure
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
-   Fuel System Wiring: Only when absolutely necessary, wiring is routed
    inside fuel tanks. This wiring is limited to sensing and monitoring
    systems, with very low energy carrying requirements, to protect
    against the occurrence of an ignition source as a result of high
    energy entering the fuel tank via the wiring. External electrical
    wiring support clamps make sure, that a cut cable cannot come into
    contact with the fuel tank boundary or structure in a fuel vapor
    area. There is a complete segregation between in-tank wiring
    equipment and fuel calculators from other aircraft system wirings.
-   Valves: All motor operated valves within the fuel tanks have the
    actuator located outside the tank wall. The valve mechanisms inside
    the tank are dual bonded and do not have an ignition hazard.
-   Pressure Switches: Pump pressure switches are mounted on the tank
    boundaries. They are separated from the fuel by a diaphragm. The
    electrical connections are fully sealed and explosion proof.
-   Fuel Leaks: It is possible for fuel or fuel vapor to leak from a
    fuel tank into an adjacent area and the accumulated fuel can become
    hazardous causing ignition. Fuel leaks from the wing and trim tanks
    go either to the leading or trailing edge cavities or to the
    outside. Any fuel overflowing from the NACA intake is directed
    downwards and away from the engines (heat source) via a fuel leak
    drip strip (angle section) located inboard of the NACA intake. In
    the leading and trailing edges the equipment is explosion proofed
    and insulated from the leakage. The APU fuel feed and Trim Tank
    transfer pipes at the rear fuselage are shrouded so any fuel leakage
    is drained overboard via the drain mast.
-   Heat Sources: Wing leading edges contain hot air ducting from the
    engines to the bleed air and anti icing systems. These pipes are
    insulated and separated from the tank boundary.

FUEL TANK SAFETY PROCEDURES (2) Working Environment NOTE: Note: You may
have to remove parts of the structure (and equipment) to get access to
parts of the tank. Use protective mats on the floor of the fuel tank to
prevent: - damage to the fuel tank structure, - injury to persons, -
safety all components before you place them inside the fuel tank, - all
wire locking must be installed/adjusted outside the fuel tank. Use only
RED tie wraps in the fuel tanks. Use only approved cleaning materials.
Make sure that all signs of solvents and cleaning agents are removed
from the equipment/components before they are installed. Put blanking
caps on all disconnected pipes and openings in components and tanks. Do
not connect electrical equipment to a power source less than 30 meters
away, unless the power source has spark-proof connectors. You must obey
the fuel safety procedures when you do work in a fuel tank. When
differences occur, you must use the approved precautions of this
procedure. WARNING: Do not use metallic wire wool in fuel tanks.

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) SERVICING Automatic refueling is
controlled by the Fuel Quantity Indicating Computer (FQIC) and may be
performed with normal electrical power (External Ground Power or APU) or
with battery power. With normal power established, opening the access
panel will power up the refuel control panel automatically. To refuel on
batteries, select BATT POWER to ON. To start refueling in the automatic
mode after the refuel panel is powered, follow these steps: - perform
the Lights (LTS) and High Level (HI. LVL) test. The high level test
verifies the operation of the high-level protection system, which
provides protection against overfilling and spillage. - make sure that
the REFUEL VALVE switches are in the NORM position - set the
Pre-selector to the required total fuel load - set the MODE SELECT to
REFUEL There is no refuel valve indicator. The indication that the valve
is open is an increase in the fuel quantity. When the refueling is
complete, the END light will illuminate. The PRESELECTED and ACTUAL
quantities should be equal (± 100 kg.).

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) DAILY CHECKS Years of operational
experience have shown that regular draining of the fuel tank water
content will prevent many fuel system problems. The Maintenance Planning
Document (MPD) recommends that operators perform this procedure every 36
hours (or less). CAUTION: The following task summaries are presented for
training only and are not supposed to be used to service an aircraft.
Always use the current Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) as the
reference and adhere to ALL safety precautions.
drain valve. If the drain valve leaks, re-seat the valve by pushing up
and releasing the drain valve. The fuel removed may be tested for water
content using a test kit.
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS Do not discharge products such as oil, fuel,
solvent, lubricant either in trash bins, soil or into the water network
(drains, gutters, rain water, waste water, etc...). Sort waste fluids
and use specific waste disposal containers. Each product must be stored
in an appropriate and specific cabinet or room such as a fire-resistant
and sealed cupboard.
DRAIN WATER CONTENT All drains should be operated to insure proper water
removal from the fuel. There are 2 drains in the center tank, 1 in each
wing tank inner cell, 1 in each wing tank outer cell (A318/319/320 only)
and 1 in each vent surge tank. The remote inlet water drain valves in
the wing cell or wing tank area have a remote inlet, with a short pipe
connected to it, which goes to the lowest part of the fuel tank. The
water drain valves in the center tank and the vent surge tanks do not
have a remote inlet. Thus they only drain their adjacent area. If
possible, the best time to drain the water from the tanks is prior to
refueling. If that is not possible, wait one hour after refueling. The
center tank drain valves are found in the electric hydraulic pump
compartments just forward of the wheel well in the belly fairing. The
wing drain valves are accessible on the lower surface of the wing. To
operate the drain valves, use the PURGER tool and push up on the valve.
Make sure to drain at least one liter of fuel for proper water removal.
Adapting pipes are available for the PURGER tools to operate the wing
drain valves from the ground. When draining is complete remove the
PURGER tool and insure that there is no leakage at the

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) DAILY CHECKS (continued) SAFETY
PRECAUTIONS The Fuel Tank Inerting System (FTIS) gives gases with low
oxygen content, referred to as Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA). This NEA
starts in the ullage space of the center tank and goes to the surge
tank. There is a possible risk of asphyxiation in the left wing surge
tank if you put your head through the NACA duct access panel and the
center tank access panels. Placards are installed in these spaces to
tell you of this risk.

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MEL/DEACTIVATION This section will
cover two procedures. The first procedure involves a failed refuel
valve. The aircraft may be dispatched per MEL and refueling of the
affected tank is accomplished by manual operation of the refuel valve.
The second procedure is the use of the Magnetic Level Indicators (MLI).
The MLI's are used to check fuel quantity in the tanks in case of an
indication malfunction or during refueling with no electrical power.
system or the MLI's if electrical power is not available (there will be
slight reduction in tank capacity if the Intercell transfer valves are
open - see AMM for tank quantities). When the desired quantity is
reached, release the plunger to close the valve. The most important
thing to remember is that there is NO High Level protection when
operating the refuel valve with the manual plunger.
CAUTION: The following task summaries are only presented for training,
and are not supposed to be used to service an aircraft. Always use the
current Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) as the reference and adhere to
ALL safety precautions.
MANUAL REFUEL VALVE OPERATION During refueling, the refuel valve
solenoid is energized and fuel pressure from the tanker/pump unit opens
the valve. If the solenoid fails or if the electrical control of the
solenoid fails, the valve may be operated manually by a plunger on the
valve. There are 3 refuel valves on the aircraft. The center tank valve
is located in the R/H wheel well on the forward wall (which is actually
the center tank rear spar). The wing tank refuel valves are located on
the left and right wing leading edge near the refuel coupling. The
refuel/Defuel coupling shown is the optional one on the LH side. NOTE:
Remember: On the A318/A319/A320, during wing refueling all of the fuel
goes to the outer cell and spills over into the inner cell, so only one
refuel valve per wing is required. To refuel a tank, PUSH and HOLD the
manual plunger on the valve. The fuel pressure from the tanker/pump unit
will open the valve. Be sure to monitor the fuel quantity carefully
using the normal indication

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MEL/DEACTIVATION (continued) USE OF
MAGNETIC LEVEL INDICATORS Each fuel tank is equipped with one or more
Magnetic Level Indicators (MLI's). In case of an indication malfunction
or during refueling without electrical power available, the MLI's may be
used to check fuel quantity. There is one MLI in the center tank, 4 in
each wing tank on the A318/319/320 and 3 in each wing on the A321. To
use the MLI, extend the indicator rod and read the UNITS mark nearest to
the bottom skin of the wing. Each tank is checked separately. The center
and outer tanks have a single MLI each. This MLI is enough to determine
the fuel volume in that tank. The wing tanks have multiple MLI's. To
determine the wing volume, use the most outboard MLI, which indicates
fuel in the tank. To check the total fuel quantity on the aircraft
determine the total in each tank (CTR, INNER, OUTER) and add them
together.

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) Do not let them fall freely. Carefully
lift the MLI until you feel the magnet engaging. Read and write down the
value indicated on the MLI.
MEL/DEACTIVATION (continued) FUEL LEVEL MAGNETIC INDICATOR In case of
failure of the quantity indicating system the fuel Manual Magnetic
Indicators (MMIs) must be used to monitor the quantity in the tanks. One
MMI is installed in the center tank and five in each wing tank. Each MMI
assembly is made of a MLI rod that can extend out of its MLI housing
(listed in AMM by MLI reference, or Magnetic Level Indicator). To
measure the fuel quantity, the magnetic level indicator has to be
unlocked. To accomplish this, use a screwdriver to push the applicable
MLI rod and turn it through 90°. Hold and carefully lower the MLI rod
fully. Then carefully lift the MLI rod until you feel the magnets. Read
the units mark nearest to the bottom-skin of the wing and write down the
number. Retract the MLI rod and use a screwdriver to turn through 90°
the bayonet type lock. The Magnetic Level indicators are a secondary
direct reading gage to calculate the fuel in the Aircraft tanks, if the
Fuel quantity indication system is unserviceable. You must follow the
fuel safety procedures when working with the fuel system. Put the safety
barriers in the position. The density of the fuel is essential for
calculating the mass of fuel in the aircraft tanks. Take a fuel sample
from the aircraft and measure its specific density. On the A321, 3
magnetic level indicators are installed per wing, and one per center
tank. The A318, A319, A320 are equipped with 4 Magnetic level indicators
per wing and one per center tank. Put an access platform below the
applicable MLI, start outboard. Use a screwdriver to push the applicable
MLI and turn it to 90° degrees. Hold and lower the MLI fully.

NOTE: The value on the MLI nearest to the wing bottom skin is the
relevant one. Insert and lock the MLI as soon as possible to avoid
damage. Aircraft attitude data is essential for fuel mass calculation.
Indication of pitch and roll data can be selected through the MCDU in
the cockpit. Data is provided by the air data inertial reference unit,
or by the fuel quantity indication computer. Refer to the table in the
AMM to find the equivalent reference number and letter. Use the
applicable MLI stick number and the applicable aircraft attitude grid
square letter to find the correct fuel quantity table in the AMM. Find
the applicable MLI units number row and the applicable aircraft attitude
row in the AMM table.Determine the intersection of the applicable rows
to give the correct volume in the tank. NOTE: Note: Only even number MLI
units are listed in the tables. For odd numbers, calculate the volume
between the nearest even number in the AMM table For fuel mass
calculation the volume has to be multiplied with the density of the
fuel. V(dm3) x Fuel(kg/dm3)= kg Add together the values for each tank to
find the total mass of fuel in the aircraft.

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MEL/DEACTIVATION (continued) METHODS TO
DETERMINE A/C ATTITUDE There are 2 methods to determine aircraft pitch
and roll when using the MLI's to calculate fuel quantity. It is possible
to use the attitude information generated by the air data system through
the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) or by the fuel system
through the Fuel Quantity Indicating Computer (FQIC), FQIS INPUT
PARAMETERS page. It is essential to use the correct fuel tables based on
aircraft attitude. The air data inputs to the ADIRU can be read by using
the alpha call-up function in the Aircraft Integrated Data System
(AIDS). With the ADIRU's in the NAV position, select the AIDS menu in
CFDS. From this menu, select CALL UP PARAM ALPHA. To access roll data
type ROLL, and to access pitch data type PTCH. After recording the data,
convert the pitch and roll references given to the equivalent
grid-square. For example: ADIRU PITCH (-1.0) = 2 ADIRU ROLL (-0.5) = C
Equivalent Grid-square = C2 The attitude information input to the FQIC
may be accessed through the CFDS FQIS INPUT PARAMETERS page. The pitch
and roll data can be used from the ADIRU if the data is available. ADIRU
data is identified by an 'A' after PITCH or ROLL. After recording the
data, convert the pitch and roll references in the same manner as the
ADIRU data above.

USING MLI Using the attitude reference from the ADIRU AIDS menu or from
FQIC CFDS menu, the MLI number, and MLI reading, find the correct fuel
table in the AMM and read the fuel volume. The final step is to convert
the volume to mass. Multiply the volume by the fuel specific gravity.
For example with the MLI n°5 in the RIGHT wing Attitude reference : C2
UNITS reading on the MLI : 10 Volume in liters : 850 Sp. Gravity - 0.81
Fuel mass = 688.5 Kg. NOTE: Only even-numbered MLI units are listed in
the tables. To calculate the volume of fuel for odd numbers, interpolate
(divide the difference) between the nearest even numbers in the table.

FUEL SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) MAINTENANCE TIPS During a walk-around
inspection, it is important to check the burst disc in the OUTER cell. A
white cross should be visible on a black background. If it is not
visible, it may indicate a problem with the tank venting system. When
aircraft emergency electrical power is used, two wing fuel boost pumps
will be supplied, one in each wing. For dispatch per the MEL, both of
these pumps must be operational. According to the AMM, during refueling
operations bonding is essential, grounding is recommended. Connect a
bonding cable between the fuel tanker and a grounding point on the
aircraft, typically on the Nose or Main gear. Connect a grounding cable
from a grounding point on the aircraft to the ground.
