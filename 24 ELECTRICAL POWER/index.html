OF MAIN GENERATORS In flight, in case of total loss of all the main
generators, and before the emergency generator connection, battery 1
will supply the AC ESS BUS, via the STAT INV and battery 2 will supply
the DC ESS BUS. This is a transient configuration, during RAT extension
or no emergency generator available. When its parameters are correct and
the speed is more than 100 knots, the emergency generator comes on line
and supplies the AC and DC ESS BUSes, and the AC and DC ESS SHED BUSes.
When the speed is lower than 100 knots, the emergency generator is
deactivated. The batteries supply the AC and DC ESS BUSes. The DC BAT
BUS is recovered. When the speed drops below 50 knots, the AC ESS BUS
disconnects from the static inverter.

IDG COOLING SYSTEM (3) GENERAL
TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE MONITORING
The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil cooling system consists of [
an IDG oil cooler, which is part of the engine fuel/oil heat management
system. The IDG oil cooler is connected to the IDG by [ two oil
connections (in and out).
Temperature sensors sense the IDG oil inlet and oil outlet temperatures.
The Generator Control Unit (GCU) monitors the oil outlet sensor for
indication on the ECAM and for advisory and overheat
detection/indication. The GCU compares the oil in and oil out
temperature to determine the IDG internal temperature rise. From this
data, the GCU can determine if there is an internal IDG problem or an
external cooling problem. An open circuit of the IDG oil outlet
temperature sensor is a class 3 fault, and no flight deck effects are
presented. The GCU will automatically provide the IDG oil inlet
temperature plus a nominal temperature offset and display it as the oil
outlet temperature on the ECAM ELEC page. [ A pressure switch senses
low IDG oil charge pressure. The switch is monitored by the GCU for the
low oil pressure fault warning.
OPERATION PRINCIPLE A scavenge pump in the IDG pumps the oil through the
[ scavenge filter and the IDG oil cooler. The engine heat management
system regulates the fuel flow through the IDG oil cooler to cool the
IDG oil. A [ charge pump provides regulated cooled oil supply pressure
to [ the generator and other users. The purpose of the IDG oil cooler
bypass valve is to protect the IDG oil from overcooling. Note that the
cooler bypass valve is not part of the engine fuel/oil heat management
system.
COLD CONDITIONS In cold conditions (oil temp \&lt;40°C), the oil pressure
increases due to high oil viscosity, then [ the cooler bypass valve
opens to bypass the IDG oil cooler. When IDG oil temperature is between
40°C and 70°C, [ the valve is in the regulating position. This position
mixes uncooled oil from the IDG and cooled oil from the IDG Oil Cooler
and returns it to the IDG.
FILTER CLOGGED A clogged filter indication is provided by a local visual
[ Delta Pressure pop-out Indicator (DPI). In case of clogging filter
condition, [ the visual indicator pops out. The DPI reset can be done
in some conditions and associated with maintenance procedures. When the
filter is clogged, [ the relief valve opens.

IDG MONITORING (2) Do not push the disconnect switch if the engine speed
is less than idle. The engine must be stopped for IDG reconnection.
OIL TEMPERATURE MONITORING Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) oil
temperature sensors monitor the input and the output oil temperature. If
a high difference between the input and the output temperature is
detected, a status message is sent to the ECAM. The difference is called
a temperature rise. The normal IDG oil inlet temperature is between 40°C
to 105°C. When the oil outlet temperature reaches 142°C, an advisory
mode is available on the lower ECAM. If the oil outlet temperature is
equal to or more than 185°C the master caution is triggered, and a
manual disconnection is written on the ECAM. If the oil outlet
temperature is more than 200°C the IDG is automatically disconnected.
OIL PRESSURE MONITORING A pressure switch operates in case of oil low
pressure (lower than 140 psi) not caused by underspeed.
THERMAL IDG DISCONNECTION If the IDG disconnection is not performed at
185°C, the temperature will increase and at 200°C an automatic thermal
disconnection should occur to protect the IDG. A warning message is sent
to the ECAM system and a BITE MESSAGE (THERMAL DISCONNECT) is sent to
the CFDS. If this thermal disconnection fails, the message "THERMAL
DISC. FAILED" is sent to the CFDS and a warning message is sent to the
ECAM system. Note: After a thermal disconnection, the IDG must be
replaced. The class 2 message "IDG OIL DELTA TEMP" is generated by the
system BITE. If there is no difference between the input and the output
temperature, the class 2 message "IDG COOLER" is generated by the system
BITE. In both cases, the "AC GEN MAINTENANCE STATUS" is displayed on the
ECAM STATUS page.
TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE INDICATION The oil outlet temperature is
displayed on the ECAM System Display. In case of high oil outlet
temperature or oil low pressure, the following warnings are triggered: -
MASTER CAUTION light, - Single chime, - The message "ELEC IDG 1(2) OIL
OVHT or ELEC IDG 1(2) OIL LO PR" is displayed on the EWD, - The FAULT
legend on the corresponding IDG P/BSW comes on amber. The IDG must be
disconnected immediately by: - Opening the safety guard, - Pushing the
IDG P/BSW for a maximum of 3 seconds. Note: Disconnection is only
possible if the related engine is running above underspeed.

IDG DRIVE PART D/O (3) Generator (PMG) frequency to determine the
generator frequency. Note that the PMG is mounted on the IDG
differential output gear. The PMG frequency signal is compared with a
GCU internal frequency reference. The difference, between the actual PMG
frequency and the frequency reference, [ creates an error signal in the
servovalve control loop circuitry. The frequency error signal is then
used to control the servovalve current flow via the SVR. The servovalve
works by porting oil to an hydraulic control cylinder which determines
the position of [ a variable displacement hydraulic unit. Depending on
the error signal, the servovalve ports more or less oil to the cylinder
to maintain the desired [ generator frequency (IDG output speed). As
IDG speed (thus PMG frequency) decreases below the reference frequency
setpoint, the servovalve supplies current increases, resulting in an IDG
output speed increase. During normal operation, the SVR is closed to
allow current flow in the servovalve control loop. Under certain channel
failure conditions, the SVR is opened to make sure that the servovalve
drive current from the GCU is completely removed.
GENERAL The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) consists of a [ Constant
Speed Drive (CSD) and an [ AC generator mounted side by side in a
single housing. [ The CSD components convert a variable input speed to
a constant output speed. The CSD portion of the IDG is a hydromechanical
device that adds to or subtracts from the variable input speed of the
engine gearbox. The CSD performs this operation by controlled
differential action to maintain the constant output speed required to
drive the AC generator. The IDG is cooled and lubricated by the oil
circulation system. [ The oil is cooled by an external mounted IDG oil
cooler.
IDG DRIVE CONTROL The Constant Speed Drive converts the variable input
speed [ provided by the engine gearbox to the constant [ output speed
through the CSD hydromechanical components.
IDG SPEED CONTROL
ENGINE SPEED SENSING
The Generator Control Unit (GCU) performs the output speed control for
the IDG via the servovalve control loop whenever several conditions are
met: - [ The GCU is powered-up, - [ Engine input speed to the IDG is
sufficient for speed control to begin, - No failure is present in the
channel to trip the servovalve control circuit.
The FADEC provides the GCU with the corresponding engine speed
information, which is also used for the underspeed protections.
SERVOVALVE CONTROL LOOP The servovalve control loop is composed of a
hydraulic servovalve in the IDG and control circuitry in the [ GCU
which includes the ServoValve Relay (SVR). The output speed control is
performed as follows: the GCU control circuit monitors [ the Permanent
Magnet
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
OIL TEMPERATURE SENSING There are two oil temperature sensors in the
IDG: - [ One on the IDG oil inlet port, - [ One on the IDG oil outlet
port. Both sensors are thermistors. The GCU uses the sensor signals to
determine oil inlet, oil outlet and rise temperature for IDG protection.
The temperature information is also sent to the ECAM. If oil outlet
temperature is above 185°C, [ the FAULT legend comes on amber on the
IDG pushbutton.

delta pRESSURE indicator (dpi)
FIRE SWITCH
The scavenge filter is fitted with an oil filter [ Differential
Pressure Indicator (DPI). If the delta pressure across the scavenge
filter is 50 ± 8 psi, the [ DPI (pop-out) shows the clogged position.
In that case, the IDG should be serviced.
In case of engine fire, if the related fire switch is pressed in, a 28V
DC signal is sent to the corresponding GCU, which shuts down its IDG. In
such a case, the reset of the GCU is not required.
OIL PRESSURE SWITCH A Low Oil Pressure (LOP) switch located in the IDG
charge oil circuit provides a signal to the GCU when IDG charge oil
pressure is less than 140 psi. In low oil pressure condition, not caused
by underspeed, [ the IDG pushbutton FAULT legend comes on amber and an
ECAM warning is triggered.
IDG DISCONNECTION The IDG P/B FAULT legend comes on if the IDG oil
pressure is less than 140 psi or if the IDG oil outlet temperature is
above 185°C. In both conditions, the IDG must immediately be
disconnected! IDG disconnection is achieved by [ a solenoid activated
clutch. It must be performed, via the IDG switch if the [ IDG
pushbutton FAULT legend is on. If the temperature reaches 200°C, [ a
solder fuse melts and automatically releases the disconnect mechanism to
open the IDG disconnect clutch. When the IDG pushbutton is depressed and
no underspeed is detected, [ a 28V DC signal is sent to the
disconnection solenoid which will [ open the clutch. In case of low oil
pressure due to underspeed, the FAULT legend remains off. In underspeed
condition, it is not possible to disconnect the IDG. After a thermal
disconnection, the IDG must be changed. IDG reset must be performed on
the ground with the engine shutdown, by pulling the [ reset ring
mounted on the IDG casing.

IDG GENERATOR PART D/O (3) GENERATOR EXCITER STAGE
GENERAL The AC generator portion of the Integrated Drive Generator (IDG)
is a three-phase, brushless, spray oil cooled unit. The generator rotor
consists of an exciter rotor, a diode rectifier assembly, and a two-pole
main field rotor. The exciter rotor and main field rotor are mounted on
a common shaft supported by a roller bearing set at the drive end and a
ball bearing set at the opposite end. The Permanent Magnet Generator
(PMG) rotor is mounted on the outputting gear of the differential
assembly. The main generator stator, exciter stator, PMG stator and
generator Current Transformer (CT) are mounted in the IDG housing.
The exciter stage of the generator consists of a three-phase winding
rotor which is located on the main generator rotor shaft. The stator
windings and a full wave bridge rectifier (rotating diode rectifier) are
also located on the rotor shaft. As it rotates, the exciter stage
converts a DC field voltage to an AC voltage. The AC voltage is
rectified by the rotating diode rectifier and is supplied to the main
generator rotor.
MAIN GENERATOR The main generator consists of a two-pole rotor and a
three-phase winding stator. As the rotor rotates, the DC field induces
an AC voltage in the stator windings.
PERMANENT MAGNET GENERATOR (PMG)
CURRENT TRANSFORMER
The PMG consists of a 16-pole permanent magnet rotor and a three-winding
stator. As the engine is running, the PMG rotor induces an AC voltage in
the windings of the PMG stator. At normal operation speed, the output
from the PMG is: - 3 phases - 1681,3 Hz - 110 VAC. The output of the PMG
is supplied to the Generator Control Unit (GCU) which uses it for the
following functions: - The GCU transforms and rectifies the voltage via
a Transformer Rectifier (TR) to 28V DC for the internal power supply. -
The GCU sends the PMG voltage via the Generator Control Relay (GCR) to
the voltage and frequency regulation circuit where it is rectified and
applied to the exciter field for voltage regulation. The PMG frequency
is also used to monitor the generator frequency (for the IDG drive
control).
Current Transformers (CTs) monitor the 3-phase feeder cables, from the
Generator to the GLC. The GCUs use the CT outputs for protection
functions (differential current, overcurrent, overload). One CT is
located inside the IDG and the other is just before the GLC. They are
called the 3-Hole Current Transformers. From the engine pylon to the
forward cargo compartment, each feeder cable is split into two, so that
there are now two cables per phase (total 6). Another CT, located in the
forward cargo compartment, monitors the 6-feeder cables. It is called
the 6-Hole Current Transformer. The GCU monitors its current output for
open cable protection.

UNDERSPEED Each GCU receives engine speed data from the Full Authority
Digital Engine Control (FADEC) via an ARINC 429 bus. These data are used
for the underspeed set point, various other controls and protections and
BITE functions. If these data are not available, the GCU uses the PMG
frequency to determine the input speed of the generator.

IDG GENERATOR PART D/O (3) GENERATOR P/BSW The GEN P/BSW on the overhead
ELEC panel is used to connect or disconnect the generator and to reset
the GCU. When the GEN P/BSW is pressed in (on position) and the
generator is not connected, the GEN COMMAND circuit is supplied,
enabling the closure of the GCR to excite the generator. If all
generator parameters are correct, the Power Ready Relay (PRR) closes and
connects power to the Generator Line Contactor (GLC) via the GLC AUX
RELAY. The GLC opens or closes to connect 115V AC to the network
according to priority rules and the network supply status.
The FAULT legend comes on amber if during operation any parameter is
incorrect. At this time the GCR, PRR and the GLC all open. The SVR will
also open if FAULT is frequency related. Additionally, the FAULT light
comes on in the following cases: - The related engine is shutdown or the
generator is not connected - If the GLC has failed open (STUCK OPEN)
When the GEN P/BSW is released out (off position), the OFF legend
appears in white. The GCR opens (if not already open) to de-energize the
generator field and the GLC opens. In addition, the computer reset
circuit is supplied to reset the GCU.
POINT OF REGULATION The Point Of Regulation (POR) is located between the
3-hole CT and the GLC. It takes in to account the generator feeder
impedance (voltage drop of 1 to 2V AC). The GCU monitors the
three-generator phase voltages at the POR for: - Voltage regulation
control, - Over and undervoltage protection, - Incorrect Phase Sequence
protection.
VOLTAGE REGULATION The GCU monitors the POR in order to keep the voltage
at nominal value (115V AC) at this point. The principle of operation of
the voltage regulator is by modulation of the voltage through the
exciter field. The output from the PMG is connected via the GCR to the
excitation and regulation control module, where it is converted into DC
voltage and applied to the exciter field. The voltage frequency
regulation module senses the average of the three phases at the POR and
compares it against a reference voltage. If a difference exists, the
voltage regulator adjusts the exciter field current as needed to keep a
constant voltage at the POR.

AC MAIN GENERATION D/O (3) IDG Two identical Integrated Drive Generators
(IDGs) are used to supply the main AC network. Each IDG is a two-pole
high-speed (24 000 rpm) brushless spray oil cooled unit. It comprises
the drive part and the generator part in a common housing. The generator
part has a Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), an exciter generator with
rotating diodes and the main generator. Each IDG is controlled and
monitored by its own Generator Control Unit (GCU).
The OFF legend comes on when the P/BSW is released out. After a fault
detection (tripping of the generator), cycling the GEN 1(2) switch
OFF/ON resets the GCU.
GEN 1 LINE P/BSW In SMOKE configuration (red smoke light on) an
activation of this P/BSW opens the GLC but the generator stays energized
to supply directly the fuel pumps 1 LH and 1 RH side (the OFF legend
indicates, the P/BSW position). Notice that during the AVIONICS SMOKE
procedure (GEN 1 LINE P/BSW OFF), the related generator FAULT light
remains off.
GCU
GLC/BTC CONTROL AND MONITORING
Each Generator Control Unit (GCU) is supplied by the PMG from its
related IDG and, as a back-up, through the battery bus 301PP. The
related engine under speed information is given by the Full Authority
Digital Engine Control (FADEC). The main functions of the GCU are: -
control of the field excitation via the Generator Control Relay (GCR), -
voltage regulation via the Excitation Control and Regulation module, -
speed regulation through the ServoValve Relay (SVR), - control of the
Generator Line Contactor (GLC) via the Power Ready Relay (PRR), the Bus
Tie Contactor (BTC) and the AUX RELAY 1, - control and protection of the
IDG and the network.
The GLC and the BTC are under control of the related GCU and the Bus Tie
Logic. If all parameters are correct, the GLC connects the generator to
its own bus bar. The BTC connects the generator to the transfer line or
another power source to the bus bar (with generator off) depending on
the priority logic.
GENERATOR P/BSW The generator P/BSW is used to connect or disconnect the
generator output to or from the bus bar, and to reset the GCU. The FAULT
legend comes on when the P/BSW is pressed in and the related engine is
shutdown or during operation if any parameter is not correct. The fault
information is sent via the SDACs to the ECAM.

GCU D/O (3) GENERAL
FREQUENCY REGULATION
The Generator Control Unit (GCU) 1 and 2 are identical and
interchangeable. Pin programming provides the GCU with the following
information: - the aircraft type, - the GCU position, - the current
limit for voltage regulation, - the load limit. The main functions of
the GCU are: - regulation of the generator voltage, - regulation of the
generator frequency, - regulation of the generator speed (ServoValve
(SV) control), - control and protection of the network and the
generator, - interface with System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDACs)
for the ECAM, - interface with Full Authority Digital Engine Control
(FADEC) for engine speed, - interface with Centralized Fault Display
System (CFDS) via the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU).
The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) frequency is regulated by a
servovalve in the IDG and the servovalve control circuit in the GCU (via
the SV relay). The PMG frequency is compared with a GCU internal
reference frequency. The difference generates a control current to drive
the servovalve to produce the right output frequency.
CONTROL AND PROTECTION The GCU control and protection functions are
mainly performed by 3 internal relays: - the GCR controls the generator
excitation, - the Power Ready Relay (PRR) controls the GLC, - the SV
relay controls the IDG speed. If a protection function is triggered, the
GCR, the PRR and, in some cases the SV relay, are de-energized.
VOLTAGE REGULATION The voltage regulation is achieved by regulating the
current through the exciter field. The voltage is kept at a nominal
value (115V AC) at the Point Of Regulation (POR). The POR is located at
the end of the generator feeder upstream of the Generator Line Contactor
(GLC). The output from the Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG) is connected
via the Generator Control Relay (GCR) to the excitation and regulation
control module for frequency monitoring use.

CATTS Ltd
UNDERSPEED Engine speed information provided by FADEC is used to sense
the IDG input speed. When engine speed falls below the underspeed
threshold the PRR trips and the excitation is biased off due to
underfrequency. In case of an absent FADEC speed signal to the GCU, a
back-up signal is provided by the engine master switch to inform the GCU
logic that the engine will shut down. Note: in case of detected
underspeed (e.g. engine shut down) no reset action via the GEN P/BSW is
required.
OVERVOLTAGE The GCU performs an overvoltage protection function. If the
highest individual phase at POR reaches 130 ± 1.5 volts, the PRR and the
GCR are tripped. The higher the voltage, the faster the relays trip.
Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 56 of 255
OVERFREQUENCY The GCU performs an overfrequency protection function. If
the frequency is above 435 ± 1Hz, for at least 4 seconds, the GCU trips
the PRR and the GCR. If the frequency is above 452 Hz, for at least 160
milliseconds, the GCU trips the PRR, the GCR and also the SV relay.
OVERLOAD / OVERCURRENT The IDG Current Transformers (CTs) provide
current sensing information to the GCU. This information is used to
determine generator load for overload, overcurrent, phase imbalance
(delta) and also Differential Current Protection. In case of overload,
the GCU sends signals to the SDAC for an ECAM message and to the FAULT
light on the GALY &amp; CAB P/BSW. If an IDG fails, the Bus Tie Contactors
(BTCs) close and some galleys loads are automatically shed. GCUs monitor
BTC status and determine if overcurrent protection (BTC lockout) should
be inhibited. If the galleys are not automatically shed the BTC lockout
is inhibited, to allow the GALY &amp; CAB P/BSW to be selected OFF.

GCU D/O (3) ENGINE FIRE AND OPEN FEEDER CABLE PROTECTION The feeder
cables are duplicated from the engine pylon to the forward cargo
compartment. A 6 hole CT monitors each cable. If an open cable is
detected, or if the ENG FIRE P/BSW is released out, the GCU trips the
GCR and the PRR. The GLC opens after the PRR trips.
DIFFERENTIAL CURRENT PROTECTION The Differential Protection is based on
the comparison of each phase of the Line 3-hole CT and the CTs in the
IDG. If a differential current flow is above 50 ± 10A for at least 60
milliseconds, the PRR and GCR are tripped. Note: the Differential
Protection circuit reset is done via the GEN P/BSW, but it is limited to
two attempts. After correcting the fault a cold reset must be performed.

GCU D/O (3) PROTECTION FUNCTION SUMMARY The Generator Control P/BSW has
ON and OFF/RESET functions. Switch all power off and then on again to
reset the fault logic; this is called a cold reset. Most fault
protections allow two reset attempts and then the reset function is
inhibited.
BITE The GCU is a type 1 computer. Its BITE detects and isolates active
and passive failures. The BITE consists of two sections: - Operational
BITE, - Maintenance BITE. After generator tripping, the operational BITE
identifies the protection, analyses the conditions and determines the
fault origin. The maintenance BITE completes the operational BITE and
performs a self-test of the GCU to provide an indication of system
integrity. Faults are kept in the Non Volatile Memory (NVM). The GCU
BITE communicates with the CFDS via the GAPCU (type 1 system).
INTERFACE Each GCU is interfaced to both SDACs to transmit system
failure or caution data to the ECAM. The Landing Gear Control and
Interface unit (LGCIU) 1 provides ground/flight information to the GCU
(BITE).

generator is not interchangeable with the Integrated Drive Generators
(IDGs). It is driven at a constant speed by the APU and can be connected
to the electrical network. It can supply the entire electrical network
if no other power sources are available.

AC AUXILIARY GENERATION D/O (3) APU GENERATOR
APU GEN CONTROL AND MONITORING
The APU generator can supply all or part of the normal network,
depending on the priority logic given by the bus tie logic. The APU
generator is a two-pole high speed (24 000 rpm) brushless spray oil
cooled generator. Speed regulation is made by the APU engine without a
Constant Speed Drive (CSD); it is not interchangeable with the
Integrated Drive Generators (IDGs).The APU generator is cooled and
lubricated by the APU oil. An oil temperature bulb is installed on the
APU generator oil outlet part. The bulb is directly connected to the APU
[ Electronic Control Box (ECB). In case of oil temperature above 185°C,
the ECB commands an immediate [ shutdown of the APU.
The APU generator switch is used to connect or disconnect the APU
generator and to reset the GAPCU. - The FAULT legend only comes on if
the switch is pressed in, the APU is running (&gt;95%), and one parameter
is not correct. - The OFF legend comes on when the switch is released
out. After a fault detection (tripping of the generator), the GAPCU must
be reset by setting the switch to OFF and back to ON. The APU Generator
Line Contactor (GLC) is under control of the GAPCU and the bus tie
logic. If all generator parameters are correct, the AGLC connects the
generator to [ the transfer line. The connection to the busbars depends
on the priority logic and the network supply status (BTCs and GLCs).
APU GEN CONTROL MODULE (GAPCU) The APU Generator Control Module is part
of the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU). The GAPCU
controls both the APU generator and the EXT PWR. The power for the GAPCU
is supplied by: - the APU Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG), - the EXT
PWR, - the BATtery BUS as a back-up supply. The control module main
functions are: - control of the field excitation through the Generator
Control Relay (GCR), - voltage regulation, - control of the APU
Generator Line Contactor (GLC) through the Power Ready Relay (PRR) in
conjunction with the bus tie logic, - control and protection of the APU
generator and the network. The GAPCU has an interface with the SDAC and
to the CFDIU. APU ECB carries out the speed regulation. At 95% rpm, the
ECB sends an APU ready signal to the GAPCU.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
TRANSFER CIRCUIT The transfer circuit has a [ transfer line and the two
[ BTCs. This circuit lets the power sources (GEN 1, 2, APU, External
Power) supply all or half of the network according to the priority and
the bus tie logic. The bus tie logic gives information about the network
supply status. This information is used for: - Non parallel operation, -
Supply priority, - Transfer circuit control.
APU GEN FEEDER CABLES The feeder cables are routed through the cabin
ceiling to the rear C/B panel in the cockpit where they are sent through
a [ 3-hole current transformer before connection to the APU GLC. [ The
Current Transformer (CT) gives differential current protection.

ONLY APU RUNNING With the APU running and the APU GEN pushbutton in the
ON position, the connection to the transfer network is only possible if
one or both of the IDG Generators are offline and the External
electrical power not connected. Two sets of contacts from the
de-energized EPC AUX relay and the contacts from the de-energized EPC
make sure that the APU GLC voltage supply is interrupted even if the PRR
of the APU Generator GCU is energized. If the EPC AUX and the EPC are
de-energized (no ground electrical power) the contacts of the IDG's GLCs
and the BTCs will then determine if the APU GLC will be energized. If
the IDG's GLCs are de-energized and the BTCs are energized, the APU GLC
is then energized and the APU generator supplies the transfer network.

EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY D/O (3) OPERATION
GENERAL The Ground Power Unit (GPU) supplies the Transfer Circuit
through the External Power Contactor (EPC).A Ground and Auxiliary Power
Control Unit (GAPCU) controls and protects the connection and
disconnection of the GPU and the APU generator to the network.
GROUND POWER CONTROL &amp; MONITORING
EXT PWR NOT IN USE (AVAILABLE) When the Maintenance Bus switch is
selected to ON, the Not In Use legend comes off on the External
Electrical power panel and the GPU then supplies the A/C service buses.
The AVAIL legend remains on, on the 35VU.
DESCRIPTION The 115V AC, 400 Hz, 3 phase output of the GPU is connected
to the aircraft network through the EPC and Bus Tie Contactors
(BTCs).The GAPCU monitors permanently the quality of the delivered
ground power. The monitoring and control of the connection and
disconnection is made by two internal relays. The Interlock Monitoring
Relay (IMR) and the Power Ready Relay (PRR). At least one faulty
parameter opens both relays.
PRR AND IMR POWER SUPPLY The IMR is energized when: - The interlock
voltage is more than 13V DC, less than 42V DC and less than 60V AC. -
All control and protection parameters are valid. The PRR is energized
when: - The external power interlock is valid, - And all parameters are
correct. The annunciators NOT IN USE and AVAILABLE located on the
external power panel are ON.
SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTION (PTC) If a short circuit occurs on the PRR
output line sensed by the Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) sensor,
the red PTC TRIP LED on the front face of the GAPCU comes on and a BITE
message is sent to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).

EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY D/O (3) OPERATION (continued) EXT PWR IN USE (ON)
When the External Power (EXT PWR) P/B switch is pressed (momentary
switch action), the flip flop sends a ground signal to the solenoid of
the EPC auxiliary relay 5XG. The relay connects power from 1000XG to the
GLC/BTC logic. Depending on the supply status the logic will authorize
the closure of the EPC. At the External Power panel: - The NOT IN USE
light will extinguish, - The AVAIL light remains ON. On the EXT PWR
switch in the cockpit: - The AVAIL light extinguishes, - The ON light
comes ON.

GAPCU D/O (3) MONITORING
GENERAL The Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU) controls the
APU Generator (GEN) and the External Power System. The APU Generator
Line Contactor (GLC), the External Power Contactor (EPC) and their
related Auxiliary Relays can only close when the correct conditions
exist. They are opened manually or automatically, by the control and
protection circuits. The GAPCU also performs BITE analysis and
communication, and interfaces with other systems: - Generator Control
Units (GCUs), - APU Electronic Control Box (ECB), - Centralized Fault
Display Interface Unit (CFDIU), - System Data Acquisition Concentrators
(SDACs), - Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) 1.
POWER SUPPLY The GAPCU internal power supply module can be supplied by
the external power or the APU GEN via internal Transformer/Rectifiers
(TRs). The supply module also has a back up supply from the BAT BUS.
EXT PWR CONTROL The GAPCU performs the following functions for the
external power control and BITE: - monitoring, - interlock function, -
External Power Contactor (EPC) control, - protection, - BITE function, -
communication and interface.
Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56 or V2500)
CATTS Ltd
The GAPCU permanently monitors the quality of the external power supply.
A faulty parameter automatically disconnects the external power from the
transfer line opening the Power Ready Relay (PRR) to open the EPC, and
Interlock Monitoring Relay (IMR) to trip the ground cart. In some GAPCU
failure conditions, the back-up card can control the PRR, so that the
external power can still be connected to the aircraft. In these cases,
after a "cold reset" the PRR closes and the external power is supplied
to the aircraft with limited protection. In that case, no bite function
is available.
EPC CONTROL The closed PRR provides 28V DC to the solenoid of the EPC
AUX relay (5XG). The AUX relay is responsible for opening and closing of
the main contactor (EPC). The EPC AUX relay is also responsible for the
priority switching, i.e. the External Power over the APU GEN. When the
EXT PWR P/BSW is pressed the FLIP/FLOP provides a fixed ground signal to
close the EPC AUX relay. Depending on the network supply status, the EPC
AUX relay connects power via the de-energized APU GLC, to the EPC. The
EPC then connects the GPU to the transfer line. When the EXT PWR P/BSW
is pressed again, the FLIP/FLOP removes the ground so that the AUX relay
and EPC open.
PROTECTION The GAPCU performs the following protection functions for the
external power: - over and under voltage, - over and under frequency, -
over current, - overload, - EXT PWR interlock, - Incorrect Phase
Sequence (IPS), - open cable or open/short circuit,
Issue 012 - Revision 01 - Dated 04/04/2025 82 of 255
- EPC failure. The Over Voltage (OV) protection is accomplished by
monitoring the highest phase voltage at the Point Of Reference (POR). An
OV condition exists when the highest phase voltage exceeds 130 +/- 1,5V
AC. After an inverse delay, the IMR, PRR and EPC are tripped. The Under
Voltage (UV) is sensed in the same way as OV. An UV condition exists
when the lowest phase voltage is less than 101,5 +/1,5V AC. After a 4,5
second time delay max, the PRR, IMR and EPC are tripped. An over current
on the wiring between the PRR and the aircraft bus (1000XG) will change
the status of the Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) sensor (high
impedance). The sensor then provides a signal to switch on the red PTC
LED on the front face of the GAPCU and sends a BITE message to the
Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS). The PTC and the PTC LED are
only supplied if the EXT PWR remains connected to the receptacle
(i.e. PRR is still closed). The LED is not a "latched" status signal.
Thus, if a short circuit does exist, and the LED is illuminated, it will
go off as soon as the external power is removed from the receptacle.
(tripping of the generator), the control and must be reset by setting
the P/BSW to OFF and back to on.
APU GLC CONTROL AND MONITORING The APU GLC is under control of the APU
GLC AUX relay and the GLC/BTC logic. If all APU GEN parameters are
correct, the APU GLC connects the APU GEN power to the transfer line.
overheat protection An oil temperature bulb is installed on the APU GEN
oil outlet port. The bulb is directly connected to the APU ECB. In case
of oil temperature above 185°C, the ECB commands an immediate shutdown
of the APU.
COMMUNICATION AND INTERFACE The GAPCU is connected with the GCUs, the
CFDIU and the SDACs.
WITH THE GCU The GAPCU communicates with the two GCUs via MIL-STD 1553
links.
WITH THE CFDIU
APU GEN CONTROL
The GAPCU is the CFDS interface for the enhanced Electrical Power
Generation System (EPGS). The GAPCU communicates with the CFDIU via
ARINC 429 links. During normal mode of transmission, the GAPCU
continuously sends its own and the two GCUs fault data, to the CFDIU.
The main functions are: - control of the field excitation through the
Generator Control Relay (GCR), - voltage regulation, - control of the
APU GLC through the PRR in conjunction with the BTC/GLC logic, - control
and protection of the APU GEN and the network.
WITH THE SDAC The GAPCU continuously communicates with the SDACs via
ARINC 429 links. The SDACs provide system data and fault data to the
ECAM.
APU P/BSW The APU GEN P/BSW is used to connect or disconnect the APU GEN
and to reset the APU GEN control part. After a fault detection

BUS TIE LOGIC D/O (3) GENERAL The Bus Tie Logic is responsible for the
following tasks: - No parallel operation of two power sources on the
transfer line or busbars. - Automatic power transfer in case of a supply
failure. - The priority of Power Sources to supply the AC BUSES. The
order of these priorities is: 1- On side Integrated Drive Generator
(IDG) to own busbars, the IDG 1 to AC BUS 1 and the IDG 2 to AC BUS 2.
2- External Power (EXT PWR). 3- APU Generator (APU GEN). 4- Opposite IDG
(IDG 1 to AC BUS 1 and 2 or IDG 2 to AC BUS 2 and 1). The Bus Tie Push
Button Switch (PB/Sw) is used to control the Bus Tie Contactors (BTCs)
of the AC Buses only. DC Bus Tie Logic and DC BTC control is independent
of the AC Logic and automatic.
BATTERIES CONNECTED With battery power only, the BTCs are closed because
all the other contactors and auxiliary relays are open. The BTC power
supply is from the BAT BUS. When APU GEN or EXT PWR are available, the
BTC power supply is provided by the Ground and Auxiliary Power Control
Unit (GAPCU). Note: The BTC ground path is provided by the related
Generator Control Unit (GCU). This is a protection against Over Current.
It inhibits an automatic transfer to a network fault, by inhibiting the
BTC close logic (BTC lockout).

ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM LINE MAINTENANCE (2) SERVICING CHECK OF THE OIL
LEVEL AND FILTER DPI Each engine (HP rotor) drives its related
Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) through the accessory gearbox. The
drive speed varies according to the engine rating. The IDG internal
gearing, converts the variable gearbox frequency to a stable 400 Hz. The
IDG supplies a 115 V AC, 3-phase, and 400 Hz AC. At some point,
servicing will be required of the IDG. In this module you will see a
video that will demonstrate the correct servicing procedures of the IDG.
Check the oil level and the filter Differential Pressure Indicator (DPI)
each 150 Flight Hours (FH) or each time the engine cowls are opened.
Depending on when the time schedule occurs there might be a reason,
during transit checks, that you must check the oil level and the filter
DPI each 150 FH or each time the engine cowls are opened. On each
engine, use the sight glass that is in the vertical position to do the
check of the oil level. If it is below the green band or above the
yellow band, do the oil servicing. Clogged filter indication is provided
by a visual pop out indicator (the DPI) mounted on the IDG. This
indicator is installed opposite the drive end of the IDG.

TYPES/BRANDS OF LUBRICANTS. DO NOT MIX TYPES/BRANDS OF LUBRICANTS. Fill
the IDG with filtered oils at a maximum pressure of 35 PSI (2.4131 bar),
Inspect the oil level before and after the related engine start. Inspect
the oil level after it becomes stable (5 minutes after running), If the
oil level is at or near the top of the green band, oil servicing is not
necessary. If the oil level is below the green band or above the yellow
band, servicing is necessary.
NOTE: The IDG disconnection is irreversible in flight. Reconnection of
the system is then possible only on the ground with engines shut down.

AC EMERGENCY GENERATION D/O (3) GENERATOR The Constant Speed
Motor/Generator (CSM/G) has a hydraulic motor, which drives a generator.
The hydraulic motor is pressurized by the blue hydraulic system through
an integrated solenoid valve. The hydraulic motor speed is regulated by
a servo valve. The generator operation principle is identical to that of
the main or auxiliary generation. The generator output characteristics
are: - three phase 115/200V AC, - 400 Hz (12000 rpm), - output power: 5
kVA continuously.
CSM/G CONTROL UNIT SUPPLY During transient configuration, battery 2 and
then the Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG) supply the CSM/G control unit
and the exciter field through a voltage regulation module. The voltage
regulation module maintains the Point Of Regulation (POR) at a nominal
voltage value (115V AC).

RAT ACTIVATION (3) AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION When one of the two main AC
buses is supplied, relay 17XE or 18XE is energized. This prevents an
automatic deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT). In flight, when there
is a total failure of the two AC main buses and when the aircraft speed
is higher than 100 kts, the two relays 17XE and 18XE are de-energized,
which supplies relay 20XE with +28VDC from the hot battery bus 703PP.
Relay 20XE is then energized after 1 second.and +28VDC are supplied from
the Hot Battery Bus to the RAT solenoid 1 and the Constant Speed Motor
Generator (CSM/G) Generator Control Unit (GCU) through the de-energized
contacts of relay 22XE. The RAT extends automatically. The Constant
Speed Motor/Generator (CSM/G) control unit activates the CSM/G solenoid
valve and uses battery 2 for the supply voltage. The generator starts to
operate. After 6 seconds, relay 22XE closes its contacts. The RAT
solenoid 1 is de-energized and the control supply voltage of the CSM/G
solenoid valve is switched from Battery 2 to the Permanent Magnet
Generator (PMG) of the CSM/G.

CSM/G GCU D/O (3) GENERATOR CONTROL The automatic control logic being
set, the Generator Control Unit (GCU) internal 28V DC bus is supplied by
battery 2 through relay K3. Relay K1 is then energized, allowing the
solenoid control valve to be supplied by the internal bus (still on
battery 2). Relay K3 is held closed by the GCU internal supply via relay
K2 and the time delay-opening transistor. When the emergency generator
parameters are correct (voltage and frequency above voltage and
frequency threshold), or after 10 s equal to the Constant Speed
Motor/Generator (CSM/G) start sequence, relay K2 closes. The Generator
Line Contactor (GLC) closes and relay K3 is de-energized, allowing the
solenoid control valve power supply change over from battery 2 to the
Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG). The CSM/G can also be started manually
via the MANual ON P/BSW.
NOTE: The diagram shows the system in normal configuration (K3
de-energized, solenoid control valve supplied by PMG).
SPEED REGULATION The speed regulation module of the control unit
electrically controls the servo-valve, which regulates the hydraulic
motor speed. The GCU maintains the CSM/G at constant speed by: -
monitoring the frequency of the PMG, - and comparing it with a quartz
crystal controlled reference. The resulting error signal is then used to
control the CSM/G servo-valve to a more open or close position.
VOLTAGE REGULATION The PMG supplies the exciter field through a voltage
regulation module. The GCU maintains the CSM/G output voltage constant
by monitoring the voltage at the Point Of Regulation (POR). The output
voltage is compared to 115V AC reference and used as an operational
error to regulate the field current.

CSM/G GCU D/O (3) OPERATION When the emergency generator is operating
(frequency and voltage in tolerance) and supplying the ESSential bus
network, it will do so as long as the A/C remains above 100kts and the
main L/G is not compressed. In emergency power condition (AC buses not
powered, A/C in flight, and Airspeed greater than 100kts) the automatic
control logic being set, the Generator Control Unit (GCU) internal 28V
DC bus is supplied by battery 2 through relay K3. Relay K1 is then
energized, allowing the solenoid control valve to be supplied by the
internal bus (still on battery 2). Relay K3 is held closed by the GCU
internal supply via relay K2 and the time delay-opening transistor. The
emergency generator stops as soon as the airspeed is below 100kts and
the A/C is on ground. At 100kts a ground is removed from relay 3PH thus
allowing for a discrete to be supplied to the CSM/G CU as soon as the
Main L/G compresses. After a 400ms delay the GCU de-energizes relay K2
and K1, which in turn causes the EMER GLC to de-energize, and the
stoppage of the servo control of the generator respectively. When the
EMERgency GENerator test pushbutton 16XE is pressed in, relay 3PH
energizes simulating a loss of AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2 and a speed higher
than 100 kts. The generator then comes online supplying the ESSential
bus network until 16XE is released.

AC ESSENTIAL BUS SWITCHING (3) AC BUS 1 LOSS AUTO SWITCHING FUNCTION
Automatic switching is done in flight and on ground if the AC ESS FEED
P/BSW (11XC) is pressed in (normal position). As soon as AC BUS 1 is not
supplied, the following events occur (provided AC BUS 2 is supplied): -
3XC1 is de-energized and 20XN1 provides ground to 17XC through 20 XN2, -
after 3 seconds (17 XC time delay ), 3XC2 is energized. The AC ESS
network is recovered automatically from AC BUS 2. NOTE: During the time
delay of 3 seconds, there is a possibility of manual switching by the
flight crew. If Airspeed &gt; 50 kts (from ADIRU1), 7XB is energized. 17XC
is self-grounded through 20XN2, 7XB, and 11XC. If the AC BUS 1 is
recovered, AC ESS BUS remains on AC BUS 2. If the AC ESS FEED P/BSW 11XC
is cycled (released out and pushed back in), AC ESS BUS will switch back
to the AC BUS 1. If Airspeed \&lt; 50 KTS, 7XB is de-energized. So, if the
AC BUS 1 is recovered, AC ESS BUS will automatically switch back to the
AC BUS 1.

bcL functions
There are three identical Transformer Rectifiers (TRs): TR 1, TR 2 and
ESSential TR, each with 200 A output current in continuous operation.
Each TR converts the three phase AC into 28V DC.
Each BCL controls its battery contactor. The BCLs are identical and
interchangeable. The battery contactors are controlled in order to: -
ensure automatic battery connection for charging, - protect the battery
against thermal runaway and short-circuit, - prevent complete
discharging when the aircraft is on the ground.
batteries There are two identical nickel-cadmium batteries of 20 cells
each. If the battery voltage is below 26.5V DC, when no other electrical
source is available, a charging cycle is needed by setting the BATtery
P/B to ON and supplying the DC normal network to permit changing. The
nominal capacity of each battery is 23 Ah.
distribution TR 1, powered from AC BUS 1, supplies DC BUS 1 and DC BAT
BUS. TR 2, powered from AC BUS 2, supplies DC BUS 2. The ESS TR is
either supplied from the AC ESS BUS or the EMERgency GENerator. It can
supply the DC ESS BUS and the DC SHEDdable ESS BUS when required. The
two batteries are connected to the DC BAT BUS. BAT 1 can also supply the
STATic INVerter and BAT 2 can supply the DC ESS BUS.
tr operation The TRs start to operate as soon as they are supplied by
the associated AC busbar. Automatic switching is provided in case of TR
1 or TR 2 failure to guarantee power supply to all affected DC busbars.
battery operation BAT 1 and BAT 2 are charged from DC BAT BUS through

TRANSFORMER RECTIFIER D/O (3) GENERAL Three identical Transformer
Rectifiers (TRs) are fitted on the aircraft. They operate as soon as
they are supplied. The TRs are supplied with three phase 115V AC/400 Hz,
the DC output voltage for each TR is 28V DC at 200 A. Each TR controls
its contactor via an internal logic.
TR PROTECTION Each TR control logic consists of an overheat protection
and a minimum current flow detection to isolate the distribution circuit
from the TR.
TR 1 NORMAL CONFIGURATION As soon as AC BUS 1 is supplied, the TR 1
output is delivered to the DC BUS 1 through TR contactor (5PU1), which
is energized when no TR protection is active. The protection module is
supplied by DC sub-busbar 204PP. To reset the TR, the TR ReSeT P/BSW
15PU has to be pushed. The TR current, voltage as well as the TR
contactor position indications are sent to the ECAM system via System
Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDAC) 1 and 2.

BATTERY SYSTEM D/O (3) GENERAL The battery system is composed of two
batteries, which are mainly used to start the APU and supply AC and DC
essential network in emergency configuration. Each battery is associated
to one Battery Charge Limiter (BCL). The BCL ensures battery charge and
battery protection by controlling the battery contactor.
BATTERY DESCRIPTION The two batteries are identical and interchangeable.
Each battery is ventilated by two ducts. The differential pressure
between the cabin and the outside is used to provide battery
ventilation. Each battery has 20 Nickel-Cadmium cells in a stainless
steel case. Each battery has a nominal voltage of 24V DC and a nominal
capacity of 23 Ah.
BATTERY CONTROL Each battery is associated to a BCL, which is controlled
by the corresponding BATtery P/BSW. When the BAT P/BSW is pressed-in
(AUTO position), the BCL controls the battery coupling/uncoupling. When
released-out, the battery is uncoupled from the network and the white
OFF light comes on. NOTE: In flight, in normal configuration, the
batteries are isolated from the network by its respective BCL.

BATTERY SYSTEM D/O (3) INDICATING/MONITORING Battery parameters such as
voltage and current are displayed by the ECAM. Warnings also appears on
the ECAM. The voltmeters, located on the main ELECtrical control panel,
give battery voltage indication (HOT BUS) even in cold aircraft
configuration. The BCLs monitor the charge of the batteries. In the
event of battery thermal runaway or internal short-circuit, the battery
is isolated, the amber FAULT light comes on and the ECAM system is
activated. System failures and BITE data are sent to the Centralized
Fault Display System (CFDS).

BATTERY CHARGE LIMITER D/O (3) GENERAL The two Battery Charge Limiters
(BCLs) are identical and interchangeable. Pin programming determines the
position of the BCL and the aircraft type.
PURPOSE The main function of the BCL is to control the battery contactor
and BATtery FAULT warning. Also, BCL 1 and BCL 2 control the EMERgency
GENerator FAULT warning. The battery contactor control includes the
following functions: - protection of the battery against thermal runaway
or short circuit, - ensuring battery charging, - preventing complete
discharge, - ensuring integrity of the HOT BUS, - assisting the APU
starting. NOTE: BCL 1 and 2 also ensure battery power supply to part of
the network during transient configuration or on ground when no normal
power is available.

BATTERY CHARGE LIMITER D/O (3) BATTERY CHARGE (BAT P/BSW PRESSED IN)
When battery voltage is lower than 26.5V DC and BAT BUS voltage is
higher than 27V DC (checked by the acquisition module), the battery is
connected via contactor 6PB1. When the charge current sensed by the
battery shunt is less than 4 A decreasing for 10 s on ground or 30 min
in flight or following APU start, the battery is fully charged, the
contactor opens and the battery charge stops.
HOT BUS PROTECTION In order to maintain the HOT BUS supply, the
contactor 6PB1 opens under these conditions: - discharge current greater
than 100 A for 300 ms, - discharge current greater than 400 A for 5 ms.
THERMAL RUNAWAY OR SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTION If the charge current is
above 10 A and increasing by more than 0.375 A per minute or the charge
current is greater than 150 A for 90 s, the contactor 6PB1 opens. The
short circuit hardware protection detects the malfunction of the battery
and stops the supply of the BCL.
COMPLETE DISCHARGE PROTECTION On ground, when the battery voltage is
lower than 23V DC for 15 s, the BCL supply contactor opens
automatically.
EMERGENCY CONFIGURATION The batteries are connected to the BAT BUS after
landing in emergency configuration. The battery contactors 6PB1 and 6PB2
are closed by BCLs when the aircraft speed is lower than 100 kts.

BATTERY CHARGE LIMITER D/O (3) APU START The APU can be started by the
batteries alone or by the normal supply. When the APU start sequence is
initiated by setting the APU MASTER SWitch to ON, batteries are
connected to 28V DC BAT BUS in order to withstand the high APU starter
motor demand. When the APU start sequence is complete (50% N1), relay
6KD closes to interrupt the APU START signal. In flight, in electrical
emergency configuration, the APU start sequence is locked out during 45
s or until the Constant Speed Motor/Generator (CSM/G) is connected to
the network.
EMER GEN FAULT CONTROL In emergency configuration, if the CSM/G is
inoperative or during transient configuration, the RAT &amp; EMER GEN FAULT
legend on the EMER ELECtrical PoWeR panel comes on, controlled by BCL 1
and 2.
BAT FAULT CONTROL In case of thermal runaway or short circuit, the FAULT
legend of the BAT P/BSW comes on. An amber message and the ELEC page are
displayed on the ECAM, the MASTER CAUTion lights come on and the Single
Chime (SC) sounds. NOTE: The 5V DC for the OFF light are delivered via
15PB and 17PB resistors.
